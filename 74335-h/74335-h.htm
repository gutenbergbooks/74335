  </div>

  <p>In the fall of 1890 the author was preparing to go to Indian Territory, under the auspices of the Bureau of
    Ethnology, to continue researches among the Cherokee, when the Ghost dance began to attract attention, and
    permission was asked and received to investigate that subject also among the wilder tribes in the western part of
    the territory. Proceeding directly to the Cheyenne and Arapaho, it soon became evident that there was more in the
    Ghost dance than had been suspected, with the result that the investigation, to which it had been intended to devote
    only a few weeks, has extended over a period of more than three years, and might be continued indefinitely, as the
    dance still exists (in 1896) and is developing new features at every performance. The uprising among the Sioux in
    the meantime made necessary also the examination of a mass of documentary material in the files of the Indian Office
    and the War Department bearing on the outbreak, in addition to the study in the field of the strictly religious
    features of the dance.</p>

  <p>The first visit of about four months (December, 1890–April, 1891) was made to the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Kiowa,
    Comanche, Apache, Caddo, and Wichita, all living near together in the western part of what was then Indian
    Territory, but is now Oklahoma. These tribes were all more or less under the influence of the new religion. The
    principal study was made among the Arapaho, who were the most active propagators of the “Messiah” doctrine among the
    southern tribes and are especially friendly and cordial in disposition.</p>

  <p>On returning to Washington, the author received a commission to make an ethnologic collection for the World’s
    Columbian Exposition, and, selecting the Kiowa for that purpose as a representative prairie tribe, started out again
    almost immediately to the same field. This trip, lasting three months, gave further opportunity for study of the
    Ghost dance among the same tribes. After returning and attending to the labeling and arranging of the collection, a
    study was made of all documents bearing on the subject in possession of the Indian Office and<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_654">654</span> the War Department. Another trip was then made to the field for the purpose of
    investigating the dance among the Sioux, where it had attracted most attention, and among the Paiute, where it
    originated. On this journey the author visited the Omaha, Winnebago, Sioux of Pine Ridge, Paiute, Cheyenne, and
    Arapaho; met and talked with the messiah himself, and afterward, on the strength of this fact, obtained from the
    Cheyenne the original letter containing his message and instructions to the southern tribes. This trip occupied
    about three months.</p>

  <p>A few months later, in the summer of 1892, another journey was made to the West, in the course of which the
    southern tribes and the Sioux were revisited, and some time was spent in Wyoming with the Shoshoni and northern
    Arapaho, the latter of whom were perhaps the most earnest followers of the messiah in the north. This trip consumed
    four months. After some time spent in Washington in elaborating notes already obtained, a winter trip (1892–93) was
    made under another commission from the World’s Fair to the Navaho and the Hopi or Moki, of New Mexico and Arizona.
    Although these tribes were not directly concerned in the Ghost dance, they had been visited by apostles of the new
    doctrine, and were able to give some account of the ceremony as it existed among the Havasupai or Cohonino and
    others farther to the west. On the return journey another short stay was made among the Kiowa and Arapaho. In the
    summer of 1893 a final visit, covering a period of five months, was made to the western tribes of Oklahoma, bringing
    the personal observation and study of the Ghost dance down to the beginning of 1894.</p>

  <p>The field investigation therefore occupied twenty-two months, involving nearly 32,000 miles of travel and more or
    less time spent with about twenty tribes. To obtain exact knowledge of the ceremony, the author took part in the
    dance among the Arapaho and Cheyenne. He also carried a kodak and a tripod camera, with which he made photographs of
    the dance and the trance both without and within the circle. Several months were spent in consulting manuscript
    documents and printed sources of information in the departments and libraries at Washington, and correspondence was
    carried on with persons in various parts of the country who might be able to give additional facts. From the
    beginning every effort was made to get a correct statement of the subject. Beyond this, the work must speak for
    itself.</p>

  <p>As the Ghost dance doctrine is only the latest of a series of Indian religious revivals, and as the idea on which
    it is founded is a hope common to all humanity, considerable space has been given to a discussion of the primitive
    messiah belief and of the teachings of the various Indian prophets who have preceded Wovoka, together with brief
    sketches of several Indian wars belonging to the same periods.</p>

  <p>In the songs the effort has been to give the spirit and exact rendering, without going into analytic details. The
    main purpose of the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">655</span> is not linguistic, and as nearly every
    tribe concerned speaks a different language from all the others, any close linguistic study must be left to the
    philologist who can afford to devote a year or more to an individual tribe. The only one of these tribes of which
    the author claims intimate knowledge is the Kiowa.</p>

  <p>The wise men tell us that the world is growing happier—that we live longer than did our fathers, have more of
    comfort and less of toil, fewer wars and discords, and higher hopes and aspirations. So say the wise men; but deep
    in our own hearts we know they are wrong. For were not we, too, born in Arcadia, and have we not—each one of us—in
    that May of life when the world was young, started out lightly and airily along the path that led through green
    meadows to the blue mountains on the distant horizon, beyond which lay the great world we were to conquer? And
    though others dropped behind, have we not gone on through morning brightness and noonday heat, with eyes always
    steadily forward, until the fresh grass began to be parched and withered, and the way grew hard and stony, and the
    blue mountains resolved into gray rocks and thorny cliffs? And when at last we reached the toilsome summits, we
    found the glory that had lured us onward was only the sunset glow that fades into darkness while we look, and leaves
    us at the very goal to sink down, tired in body and sick at heart, with strength and courage gone, to close our eyes
    and dream again, not of the fame and fortune that were to be ours, but only of the old-time happiness that we have
    left so far behind.</p>

  <p>As with men, so is it with nations. The lost paradise is the world’s dreamland of youth. What tribe or people has
    not had its golden age, before Pandora’s box was loosed, when women were nymphs and dryads and men were gods and
    heroes? And when the race lies crushed and groaning beneath an alien yoke, how natural is the dream of a redeemer,
    an Arthur, who shall return from exile or awake from some long sleep to drive out the usurper and win back for his
    people what they have lost. The hope becomes a faith and the faith becomes the creed of priests and prophets, until
    the hero is a god and the dream a religion, looking to some great miracle of nature for its culmination and
    accomplishment. The doctrines of the Hindu avatar, the Hebrew Messiah, the Christian millennium, and the Hesûnanin
    of the Indian Ghost dance are essentially the same, and have their origin in a hope and longing common to all
    humanity.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_658">658</span></p>

  <p>Probably every Indian tribe, north and south, had its early hero god, the great doer or teacher of all first
    things, from the Inskeha and Manabozho of the rude Iroquoian and Algonquian to the Quetzalcoatl, the Bochica, and
    the Viracocha of the more cultivated Aztecs, Muyscas, and Quichuas of the milder southland. Among the roving tribes
    of the north this hero is hardly more than an expert magician, frequently degraded to the level of a common
    trickster, who, after ridding the world of giants and monsters, and teaching his people a few simple arts, retires
    to the upper world to rest and smoke until some urgent necessity again requires his presence below. Under softer
    southern skies the myth takes more poetic form and the hero becomes a person of dignified presence, a father and
    teacher of his children, a very Christ, worthy of all love and reverence, who gathers together the wandering nomads
    and leads them to their destined country, where he instructs them in agriculture, house building, and the art of
    government, regulates authority, and inculcates peaceful modes of life. “Under him, the earth teemed with fruits and
    flowers without the pains of culture. An ear of Indian corn was as much as a single man could carry. The cotton, as
    it grew, took of its own accord the rich dyes of human art. The air was filled with intoxicating perfumes and the
    sweet melody of birds. In short, these were the halcyon days, which find a place in the mythic systems of so many
    nations in the Old World. It was the golden age of Anahuac.” (<i><a href="#Prescott">Prescott</a>, 1.</i>)<a id="FNanchor_3"
    href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> When at last his work is well accomplished, he bids farewell to his
    sorrowing subjects, whom he consoles with the sacred promise that he will one day return and resume his kingdom,
    steps into his magic boat by the seashore, and sails away out of their sight to the distant land of sunrise.</p>

  <p>Such was Quetzalcoatl of the Aztecs, and such in all essential respects was the culture god of the more southern
    semicivilized races. Curiously enough, this god, at once a Moses and a messiah, is usually described as a white man
    with flowing beard. From this and other circumstances it has been argued that the whole story is only another form
    of the dawn myth, but whether the Indian god be an ancient deified lawgiver of their own race, or some nameless
    missionary who found his way across the trackless ocean in the early ages of Christianity, or whether we have here
    only a veiled parable of the morning light bringing life and joy to the world and then vanishing to return again
    from the east with the dawn, it is sufficient to our purpose that the belief in the coming of a messiah, who should
    restore them to their original happy condition, was well nigh universal among the American tribes.</p>

  <p>This faith in the return of a white deliverer from the east opened the gate to the Spaniards at their first coming
    alike in Haiti, Mexico, Yucatan, and Peru. (<i><a href="#Brinton">Brinton</a>, 1.</i>) The simple native welcomed the white strangers as
    the children or kindred of their long-lost benefactor, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_659">659</span>immortal
    beings whose near advent had been foretold by oracles and omens, whose faces borrowed from the brightness of the
    dawn, whose glistening armor seemed woven from the rays of sunlight, and whose god-like weapons were the lightning
    and the thunderbolt. Their first overbearing demands awakened no resentment; for may not the gods claim their own,
    and is not resistance to the divine will a crime? Not until their most sacred things were trampled under foot, and
    the streets of the holy city itself ran red with the blood of their slaughtered princes, did they read aright the
    awful prophecy by the light of their blazing temples, and know that instead of the children of an incarnate god they
    had welcomed a horde of incarnate devils. “The light of civilization would be poured on their land. But it would be
    the light of a consuming fire, before which their barbaric glory, their institutions, their very existence and name
    as a nation, would wither and become extinct. Their doom was sealed when the white man had set his foot on their
    soil.” (<i><a href="#Prescott">Prescott</a>, 2.</i>)</p>

  <p>The great revolt of the Pueblo Indians in August, 1680, was one of the first determined efforts made by the natives
    on the northern continent to throw off the yoke of a foreign oppressor. The Pueblo tribes along the Rio Grande and
    farther to the west, a gentle, peaceful race, had early welcomed the coming of the Spaniards, with their soldiers
    and priests, as friends who would protect them against the wild marauding tribes about them and teach them the
    mysteries of a greater “medicine” than belonged to their own kachinas. The hope soon faded into bitter
    disappointment. The soldiers, while rough and overbearing toward their brown-skin allies, were yet unable to protect
    them from the inroads of their enemies. The priests prohibited their dances and simple amusements, yet all their
    ringing of bells and chanting of hymns availed not to bring more rain on the crops or to turn aside the vengeful
    Apache. “What have we gained by all this?” said the Pueblos one to another; “not peace and not happiness, for these
    new rulers will not protect us from our enemies, and take from us all the enjoyments we once knew.”</p>

  <p>The pear was ripe. Popé, a medicine-man of the Tewa, had come back from a pilgrimage to the far north, where he
    claimed to have visited the magic lagoon of Shipapu, whence his people traced their origin and to which the souls of
    their dead returned after leaving this life. By these ancestral spirits he had been endowed with occult powers and
    commanded to go back and rouse the Pueblos to concerted effort for deliverance from the foreign yoke of the
    strangers.</p>

  <p>Wonderful beings were these spirit messengers. Swift as light and impalpable as thought, they passed under the
    earth from the magic lake to the secret subterranean chamber of the oracle and stood before him as shapes of fire,
    and spoke, telling him to prepare the strings of yucca knots and send them with the message to all the Pueblos far
    and near, so that in every village the chiefs might untie one knot from the string each day, and know when they came
    to the last knot that then was the time to strike.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_660">660</span></p>

  <p>From the Pecos, across the Rio Grande to Zuñi and the far-distant Hopi mesas, every Pueblo village accepted the
    yucca string and began secret preparation for the rising. The time chosen was the new moon of August, 1680, but,
    through a partial discovery of the plot, the explosion was precipitated on the 10th. So sudden and complete was the
    surprise that many Spaniards in the Pueblo country, priests, soldiers, and civilians, were killed, and the
    survivors, after holding out for a time under Governor Otermin at Santa Fé, fled to El Paso, and in October there
    remained not a single Spaniard in all New Mexico. (<i><a href="#Bandelier">Bandelier</a>, 1a, 1b.</i>)</p>

  <p>Despite their bitter disappointment, the southern nations continued to cherish the hope of a coming redeemer, who
    now assumed the character of a terrible avenger of their wrongs, and the white-skin conqueror has had bloody
    occasion to remember that his silent peon, as he toils by blue Chapala or sits amid the ruins of his former grandeur
    in the dark forests of Yucatan, yet waits ever and always the coming of the day which shall break the power of the
    alien Spaniard and restore to their inheritance the children of Anahuac and Mayapan. In Peru the natives refused to
    believe that the last of the Incas had perished a wanderer in the forests of the eastern Cordilleras. For more than
    two centuries they cherished the tradition that he had only retired to another kingdom beyond the mountains, from
    which he would return in his own good time to sweep their haughty oppressors from the land. In 1781 the slumbering
    hope found expression in a terrible insurrection under the leadership of the mestizo Condorcanqui, a descendant of
    the ancient royal family, who boldly proclaimed himself the long lost Tupac Amaru, child of the sun and Inca of
    Peru. With mad enthusiasm the Quichua highlanders hailed him as their destined deliverer and rightful sovereign, and
    binding around his forehead the imperial fillet of the Incas, he advanced at the head of an immense army to the
    walls of Cuzco, declaring his purpose to blot out the very memory of the white man and reestablish the Indian empire
    in the City of the Sun. Inspired by the hope of vengeance on the conqueror, even boys became leaders of their
    people, and it was only after a bloody struggle of two years’ duration that the Spaniards were able to regain the
    mastery and consigned the captive Inca, with all his family, to an ignominious and barbarous death. Even then so
    great was the feeling of veneration which he had inspired in the breasts of the Indians that “notwithstanding their
    fear of the Spaniards, and though they were surrounded by soldiers of the victorious army, they prostrated
    themselves at the sight of the last of the children of the sun, as he passed along the streets to the place of
    execution.” (<i><a href="#Humboldt">Humboldt</a>, 1.</i>)</p>

  <p>In the New World, as in the Old, the advent of the deliverer was to be heralded by signs and wonders. Thus in
    Mexico, a mysterious rising of the waters of Lake Tezcuco, three comets blazing in the sky, and a strange light in
    the east, prepared the minds of the people for the near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_661">661</span> coming of
    the Spaniards. (<i><a href="#Prescott">Prescott</a>, 3.</i>) In this connection, also, there was usually a belief in a series of previous
    destructions by flood, fire, famine, or pestilence, followed by a regeneration, through, the omnipotent might of the
    savior. The doctrine that the world is old and worn out, and that the time for its renewal is near at hand, is an
    essential part of the teaching of the Ghost dance. The number of these cycles of destruction was variously stated
    among different tribes, but perhaps the most sadly prophetic form of the myth was found among the Winnebago, who
    forty years ago held that the tenth generation of their people was near its close, and that at the end of the
    thirteenth the red race would be destroyed. By prayers and ceremonies they were then endeavoring to placate their
    angry gods and put farther away the doom that now seems rapidly closing in on them. (<i><a href="#Schoolcraft">Schoolcraft</a>, Ind. Tribes, 1.</i>)</p>

      THE DELAWARE PROPHET AND PONTIAC</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subhead">
    <p>Hear what the Great Spirit has ordered me to tell you: Put off entirely the customs which you have adopted since
      the white people came among us.—<i>The Delaware Prophet.</i></p>

    <p>This is our land, and not yours.—<i>The Confederate Tribes, 1752.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The English advances were slow and halting, for a long period almost imperceptible, while the establishment of a
    few small garrisons and isolated trading stations by the French hardly deserved to be called an occupancy of the
    country. As a consequence, the warlike northern tribes were slow to realize that an empire was slipping from their
    grasp, and it was not until the two great nations prepared for the final struggle in the New World that the native
    proprietors began to read the stars aright. Then it was, in 1752, that the Lenape chiefs sent to the British agent
    the pointed interrogatory: “The English claim all on one side of the river, the French claim all on the other—where
    is the land of the Indians?” (<i><a href="#Bancroft">Bancroft</a>, 1.</i>) Then, as they saw the French strengthening themselves along the
    lakes, there came a stronger protest from the council ground of the confederate tribes of the west: “This is our
    land and not yours. Fathers, both you and the English are white; the land belongs to neither the one nor the other
    of you, but the Great Being above allotted it to be a dwelling place for us; so, fathers, I desire you to withdraw,
    as I have desired our brothers, the English.” A wampum belt gave weight to the words. (<i><a href="#Bancroft">Bancroft</a>, 2.</i>) The
    French commander’s reply was blunt, but more practiced diplomats assured the red men that all belonged to the
    Indian, and that the great king of the French desired only to set up a boundary against the further encroachments of
    the English, who would otherwise sweep the red tribes from the Ohio as they had already driven them from the
    Atlantic. The argument was plausible. In every tribe were French missionaries, whose fearless courage and devotion
    had won the admiration and love of the savage; in every village was domiciliated a hardy voyageur, with his Indian
    wife and family of children, in whose veins commingled the blood of the two races and whose ears were attuned alike
    to the wild songs of the forest and the rondeaus of Normandy or Provence. It was no common tie that bound together
    the Indians and the French, and when a governor of Canada and the general of his army stepped into the circle of
    braves to dance the war dance and sing the war song with their red allies, thirty-three wild tribes declared on the
    wampum belt, “The French are our brothers and their king is our father. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_663">663</span>
    will try his hatchet upon the English” (<i><a href="#Bancroft">Bancroft</a>, 3</i>), and through seven years of blood and
    death the lily and the totem were borne abreast until the flag of France went down forever on the heights of Quebec.</p>

  <p>For some time after the surrender the unrest of the native tribes was soothed into a semblance of quiet by the
    belief, artfully inculcated by their old allies, that the king of France, wearied by his great exertions, had fallen
    asleep for a little while, but would soon awake to take vengeance on the English for the wrongs they had inflicted
    on his red children. Then, as they saw English garrisons occupying the abandoned posts and English traders passing
    up the lakes even to the sacred island of the Great Turtle, the despairing warriors said to one another, “We have
    been deceived. English and French alike are white men and liars. We must turn from both and seek help from our
    Indian gods.”</p>

  <p>In 1762 a prophet appeared among the Delawares, at Tuscarawas, on the Muskingum, who preached a union of all the
    red tribes and a return to the old Indian life, which he declared to be the divine command, as revealed to himself
    in a wonderful vision. From an old French manuscript, written by an anonymous eyewitness of the scene which he
    describes, we have the details of this vision, as related by Pontiac to his savage auditors at the great council of
    the tribes held near Detroit in April, 1763. Parkman gives the story on the authority of this manuscript, which he
    refers to as the “Pontiac manuscript,” and states that it was long preserved in a Canadian family at Detroit, and
    afterward deposited with the Historical Society of Michigan. It bears internal evidence of genuineness, and is
    supposed to have been written by a French priest. (<i><a href="#Parkman">Parkman</a>, 1.</i>) The vision, from the same manuscript, is
    related at length in Schoolcraft’s Algic Researches.</p>

  <p>According to the prophet’s story, being anxious to know the “Master of Life,” he determined, without mentioning his
    desire to anyone, to undertake a journey to the spirit world. Ignorant of the way, and not knowing any person who,
    having been there, could direct him, he performed a mystic rite in the hope of receiving some light as to the course
    he should pursue. He then fell into a deep sleep, in which he dreamed that it was only necessary to begin his
    journey and that by continuing to walk forward he would at last arrive at his destination.</p>

  <p>Early the next morning, taking his gun, ammunition, and kettle, he started off, firmly convinced that by pressing
    onward without discouragement he should accomplish his object. Day after day he proceeded without incident, until at
    sunset of the eighth day, while preparing to encamp for the night by the side of a small stream in a little opening
    in the forest, he noticed, running out from the edge of the prairie, three wide and well-trodden paths. Wondering
    somewhat that they should be there, he finished his temporary lodging and, lighting a fire, began to prepare his
    supper. While thus engaged, he observed with astonishment that the paths became more distinct as the night grew
    darker.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_664">664</span> Alarmed at the strange appearance, he was about to
    abandon his encampment and seek another at a safer distance, when he remembered his dream and the purpose of his
    journey. It seemed to him that one of these roads must lead to the place of which he was in search, and he
    determined, therefore, to remain where he was until morning, and then take one of the three and follow it to the
    end. Accordingly, the next morning, after a hasty meal, he left his encampment, and, burning with the ardor of
    discovery, took the widest path, which he followed until noon, when he suddenly saw a large fire issuing apparently
    from the earth. His curiosity being aroused, he went toward it, but the fire increased to such a degree that he
    became frightened and turned back.</p>

  <p>He now took the next widest of the three paths, which he followed as before until noon, when a similar fire again
    drove him back and compelled him to take the third road, which he kept a whole day without meeting anything unusual,
    when suddenly he saw a precipitous mountain of dazzling brightness directly in his path. Recovering from his wonder,
    he drew near and examined it, but could see no sign of a road to the summit. He was about to give way to
    disappointment, when, looking up, he saw seated a short distance up the mountain a woman of bright beauty and clad
    in snow-white garments, who addressed him in his own language, telling him that on the summit of the mountain was
    the abode of the Master of Life, whom he had journeyed so far to meet. “But to reach it,” said she, “you must leave
    all your cumbersome dress and equipments at the foot, then go and wash in the river which I show you, and afterward
    ascend the mountain.”</p>

  <p>He obeyed her instructions, and on asking how he could hope to climb the mountain, which, was steep and slippery as
    glass, she replied that in order to mount he must use only his left hand and foot. This seemed to him almost
    impossible, but, encouraged by the woman, he began to climb, and at length, after much difficulty, reached the top.
    Here the woman suddenly vanished, and he found himself alone without a guide. On looking about, he saw before him a
    plain, in the midst of which were three villages, with well-built houses disposed in orderly arrangement. He bent
    his steps toward the principal one, but after going a short distance he remembered that he was naked, and was about
    to turn back when a voice told him that as he had washed himself in the river he might go on without fear. Thus
    bidden, he advanced without hesitation to the gate of the village, where he was admitted and saw approaching a
    handsome man in white garments, who offered to lead him into the presence of the Master of Life. Admiring the beauty
    of everything about him, he was then conducted to the Master of Life, who took him by the hand and gave him for a
    seat a hat bordered with gold. Afraid of spoiling the hat, he hesitated to sit down until again told to do so, when
    he obeyed, and the Master of Life thus addressed him:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I am the Master of Life, whom you wish to see and with whom you wish to speak. Listen to what I shall tell you
      for yourself and for all the Indians.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_665">665</span></p>

  <p>He then commanded him to exhort his people to cease from drunkenness, wars, polygamy, and the medicine song, and
    continued:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The land on which you are, I have made for you, not for others. Wherefore do you suffer the whites to dwell upon
      your lands? Can you not do without them? I know that those whom you call the children of your Great Father [the
      King of France] supply your wants; but were you not wicked as you are you would not need them. You might live as
      you did before you knew them. Before those whom you call your brothers [the French] had arrived, did not your bow
      and arrow maintain you? You needed neither gun, powder, nor any other object. The flesh of animals was your food;
      their skins your raiment. But when I saw you inclined to evil, I removed the animals into the depths of the forest
      that you might depend on your brothers for your necessaries, for your clothing. Again become good and do my will
      and I will send animals for your sustenance. I do not, however, forbid suffering among you your Father’s children.
      I love them; they know me; they pray to me. I supply their own wants, and give them that which they bring to you.
      Not so with those who are come to trouble your possessions [the English]. Drive them away; wage war against them;
      I love them not; they know me not; they are my enemies; they are your brothers’ enemies. Send them back to the
      lands I have made for them. Let them remain there. (<i><a href="#Schoolcraft">Schoolcraft</a>, Alg. Res., 1.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Master of Life then gave him a prayer, carved in Indian hieroglyphics upon a wooden stick, which he was told to
    deliver to his chief on returning to earth. (<i><a href="#Parkman">Parkman</a>, 2.</i>) His instructor continued:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Learn it by heart, and teach it to all the Indians and children. It must be repeated morning and evening. Do all
      that I have told thee, and announce it to all the Indians as coming from the Master of Life. Let them drink but
      one draught, or two at most, in one day. Let them have but one wife, and discontinue running after other people’s
      wives and daughters. Let them not fight one another. Let them not sing the medicine song, for in singing the
      medicine song they speak to the evil spirit. Drive from your lands those dogs in red clothing; they are only an
      injury to you. When you want anything, apply to me, as your brothers do, and I will give to both. Do not sell to
      your brothers that which I have placed on the earth as food. In short, become good, and you shall want nothing.
      When you meet one another, bow and give one another the [left] hand of the heart. Above all, I command thee to
      repeat morning and evening the prayer which I have given thee.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Indian received the prayer, promising to do as he had been commanded and to recommend the same course to
    others. His former conductor then came and, leading him to the foot of the mountain, bid him resume his garments and
    go back to his village. His return excited much surprise among his friends, who had supposed him lost. They asked
    him where he had been, but as he had been commanded to speak to no one until he had seen the chief, he motioned with
    his hand to signify that he had come from above. On entering the village he went at once to the wigwam of the chief,
    to whom he delivered the prayer and the message which he had received from the Master of Life. (<i><a href="#Schoolcraft">Schoolcraft</a>, Alg.
    Res., 2.</i>)</p>

  <p>Although the story as here given bears plain impress of the white man’s ideas, it is essentially aboriginal. While
    the discrimination expressed by the Master of Life in favor of the French and against the English may have been due
    to the fact that the author of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_666">666</span> manuscript was a Frenchman, it
    is more probable that we have here set forth only the well-known preference of the wild tribes. The occupancy of a
    region by the English always meant the speedy expulsion of the natives. The French, on the contrary, lived side by
    side with the red men, joining in their dances and simple amusements, and entering with fullest sympathy into their
    wild life, so that they were regarded rather as brethren of an allied tribe than as intruders of an alien race. This
    feeling is well indicated in the prophet’s narrative, where the Indians, while urged to discard everything that they
    have adopted from the whites, are yet to allow the French to remain among them, though exhorted to relentless war on
    the English. The difference received tragic exemplification at Michilimackinac a year later, when a handful of
    French traders looked on unarmed and unhurt while a crew of maddened savages were butchering, scalping, and drinking
    the blood of British soldiers. The introduction of the trivial incident of the hat is characteristically Indian, and
    the confounding of dreams and visions with actual happenings is a frequent result of mental exaltation of common
    occurrence in the history of religious enthusiasts. The Delaware prophet regards the whole experience as an actual
    fact instead of a distempered vision induced by long fasts and vigils, and the hieroglyphic prayer—undoubtedly
    graven by himself while under the ecstasy—is to him a real gift from heaven. The whole story is a striking parallel
    of the miraculous experiences recounted by the modern apostles of the Ghost dance. The prayer-stick also and the
    heavenly map, later described and illustrated, reappear in the account of Känakûk, the Kickapoo prophet, seventy
    years afterward, showing in a striking manner the continuity of aboriginal ideas and methods.</p>

  <p>The celebrated missionary, Heckewelder, who spent fifty years among the Delawares, was personally acquainted with
    this prophet and gives a detailed account of his teachings and of his symbolic parchments. He says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In the year 1762 there was a famous preacher of the Delaware nation, who resided at Cayahaga, near Lake Erie, and
      travelled about the country, among the Indians, endeavouring to persuade them that he had been appointed by the
      Great Spirit to instruct them in those things that were agreeable to him, and point out to them the offences by
      which they had drawn his displeasure on themselves, and the means by which they might recover his favour for the
      future. He had drawn, as he pretended, by the direction of the Great Spirit, a kind of map on a piece of deerskin,
      somewhat dressed like parchment, which he called “the great Book or Writing.” This, he said, he had been ordered
      to shew to the Indians, that they might see the situation in which the Mannitto had originally placed them, the
      misery which they had brought upon themselves by neglecting their duty, and the only way that was now left them to
      regain what they had lost. This map he held before him while preaching, frequently pointing to particular marks
      and spots upon it, and giving explanations as he went along.</p>

    <p>The size of this map was about fifteen inches square, or, perhaps, something more. An inside square was formed by
      lines drawn within it, of about eight inches each way; two of these lines, however, were not closed by about half
      an inch at the corners. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_667">667</span>Across these inside lines, others of
      about an inch in length were drawn with sundry other lines and marks, all which was intended to represent a strong
      inaccessible barrier, to prevent those without from entering the space within, otherwise than at the place
      appointed for that purpose. When the map was held as he directed, the corners which were not closed lay at the
      left-hand side, directly opposite to each other, the one being at the southeast by south, and the nearest at the
      northeast by north. In explaining or describing the particular points on this map, with his fingers always
      pointing to the place he was describing, he called the space within the inside lines “the heavenly regions,” or
      the place destined by the Great Spirit for the habitation of the Indians in future life. The space left open at
      the southeast corner he called the “avenue,” which had been intended for the Indians to enter into this heaven,
      but which was now in the possession of the white people; wherefore the Great Spirit had since caused another
      “avenue” to be made on the opposite side, at which, however, it was both difficult and dangerous for them to
      enter, there being many impediments in their way, besides a large ditch leading to a gulf below, over which they
      had to leap; but the evil spirit kept at this very spot a continual watch for Indians, and whoever he laid hold of
      never could get away from him again, but was carried to his regions, where there was nothing but extreme poverty;
      where the ground was parched up by the heat for want of rain, no fruit came to perfection, the game was almost
      starved for want of pasture, and where the evil spirit, at his pleasure, transformed men into horses and dogs, to
      be ridden by him and follow him in his hunts and wherever he went.</p>

    <p>The space on the outside of this interior square was intended to represent the country given to the Indians to
      hunt, fish, and dwell in while in this world; the east side of it was called the ocean or “great salt-water lake.”
      Then the preacher, drawing the attention of his hearers particularly to the southeast avenue, would say to them,
      “Look here! See what we have lost by neglect and disobedience; by being remiss in the expression of our gratitude
      to the Great Spirit for what he has bestowed upon us; by neglecting to make to him sufficient sacrifices; by
      looking upon a people of a different colour from our own, who had come across a great lake, as if they were a part
      of ourselves; by suffering them to sit down by our side, and looking at them with indifference, while they were
      not only taking our country from us, but this (pointing to the spot), this, our own avenue, leading into those
      beautiful regions which were destined for us. Such is the sad condition to which we are reduced. What is now to be
      done, and what remedy is to be applied? I will tell you, my friends. Hear what the Great Spirit has ordered me to
      tell you! You are to make sacrifices, in the manner that I shall direct; to put off entirely from yourselves the
      customs which you have adopted since the white people came among us. You are to return to that former happy state,
      in which we lived in peace and plenty, before these strangers came to disturb us; and, above all, you must abstain
      from drinking their deadly <i>beson</i>, which they have forced upon us, for the sake of increasing their gains
      and diminishing our numbers. Then will the Great Spirit give success to our arms; then he will give us strength to
      conquer our enemies, to drive them from hence, and recover the passage to the heavenly regions which they have
      taken from us.”</p>

    <p>Such was in general the substance of his discourses. After having dilated more or less on the various topics
      which I have mentioned, he commonly concluded in this manner: “And now, my friends, in order that what I have told
      you may remain firmly impressed on your minds, and to refresh your memories from time to time, I advise you to
      preserve, in every family at least, such a book or writing as this, which I will finish off for you, provided you
      bring me the price, which is only one buckskin or two doeskins apiece.” The price was of course bought
      (<i>sic</i>), and the book purchased. In some of those maps, the figure of a deer or turkey, or both, was placed
      in the heavenly regions, and also in the dreary region of the evil spirit. The former, however, appeared fat and
      plump, while the latter seemed to have nothing but skin and bones. (<i><a href="#Heckewelder">Heckewelder</a>, 1.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_668">668</span></p>

  <p>From the narrative of John McCullough, who had been taken by the Indians when a child of 8 years, and lived for
    some years as an adopted son in a Delaware family in northeastern Ohio, we gather some additional particulars
    concerning this prophet, whose name seems to be lost to history. McCullough himself, who was then but a boy, never
    met the prophet, but obtained his information from others who had, especially from his Indian brother, who went to
    Tuscarawas (or Tuscalaways) to see and hear the new apostle on his first appearance.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It was said by those who went to see him that he had certain hieroglyphics marked on a piece of parchment,
      denoting the probation that human beings were subjected to whilst they were living on earth, and also denoting
      something of a future state. They informed me that he was almost constantly crying whilst he was exhorting them. I
      saw a copy of his hieroglyphics, as numbers of them had got them copied and undertook to preach or instruct
      others. The first or principal doctrine they taught them was to purify themselves from sin, which they taught they
      could do by the use of emetics and abstinence from carnal knowledge of the different sexes; to quit the use of
      firearms, and to live entirely in the original state that they were in before the white people found out their
      country. Nay, they taught that that fire was not pure that was made by steel and flint, but that they should make
      it by rubbing two sticks together.... It was said that their prophet taught them, or made them believe, that he
      had his instructions immediately from <i>Keesh-she-la-mil-lang-up</i>, or a being that <i>thought</i> us into
      being, and that by following his instructions they would, in a few years, be able to drive the white people out of
      their country.</p>

    <p>I knew a company of them who had secluded themselves for the purpose of purifying from sin, as they thought they
      could do. I believe they made no use of firearms. They had been out more than two years before I left them.... It
      was said that they made use of no other weapons than their bows and arrows. They also taught, in shaking hands, to
      give the left hand in token of friendship, as it denoted that they gave the heart along with the hand. (<i><a href="#Pritts">Pritts</a>,
      1.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The religious ferment produced by the exhortations of the Delaware prophet spread rapidly from tribe to tribe,
    until, under the guidance of the master mind of the celebrated chief, Pontiac, it took shape in a grand confederacy
    of all the northwestern tribes to oppose the further progress of the English. The coast lands were lost to the
    Indians. The Ohio and the lakes were still theirs, and the Alleghanies marked a natural boundary between the two
    sections. Behind this mountain barrier Pontiac determined to make his stand. Though the prospect of a restoration of
    the French power might enable him to rally a following, he himself knew he could expect no aid from the French, for
    their armies had been defeated and their garrisons were already withdrawn; but, relying on the patriotism of his own
    red warriors, when told that the English were on their way to take possession of the abandoned posts, he sent back
    the haughty challenge, “I stand in the path.”</p>

  <p>To Pontiac must be ascribed the highest position among the leaders of the Algonquian race. Born the son of a chief,
    he became in turn the chief of his own people, the Ottawa, whom it is said he commanded on the occasion of
    Braddock’s defeat. For this or other services in behalf of the French he had received marks of distinguished
    consideration from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_669">669</span> Montcalm himself. By reason of his natural
    ability, his influence was felt and respected wherever the name of his tribe was spoken, while to his dignity as
    chief he added the sacred character of high priest of the powerful secret order of the Midé. (<i><a href="#Parkman">Parkman</a>, 3.</i>)
    Now, in the prime of manhood, he originated and formulated the policy of a confederation of all the tribes, an idea
    afterward taken up and carried almost to a successful accomplishment by the great Tecumtha. As principal chief of
    the lake tribes, he summoned them to the great council near Detroit, in April, 1763, and, as high priest and keeper
    of the faith, he there announced to them the will of the Master of Life, as revealed to the Delaware prophet, and
    called on them to unite for the recovery of their ancient territories and the preservation of their national life.
    Under the spell of his burning words the chiefs listened as to an oracle, and cried out that he had only to declare
    his will to be obeyed. (<i><a href="#Parkman">Parkman</a>, 4.</i>) His project being unanimously approved, runners were sent out to secure
    the cooperation of the more remote nations, and in a short time the confederation embraced every important tribe of
    Algonquian lineage, together with the Wyandot, Seneca, Winnebago, and some of those to the southward. (<i><a href="#Parkman">Parkman</a>,
    5.</i>)</p>

  <p>Only the genius of a Pontiac could have molded into a working unit such an aggregation of diverse elements of
    savagery. His executive ability is sufficiently proven by his creation of a regular commissary department based on
    promissory notes—hieroglyphics graven on birchbark and signed with the otter, the totem of his tribe; his diplomatic
    bent appeared in his employment of two secretaries to attend to this unique correspondence, each of whom he managed
    to keep in ignorance of the business transacted by the other (<i><a href="#Parkman">Parkman</a>, 6</i>); while his military capacity was
    soon to be evinced in the carefully laid plan which enabled his warriors to strike simultaneously a crushing blow at
    every British post scattered throughout the 500 miles of wilderness from Pittsburg to the straits of Mackinaw.</p>

  <p>The history of this war, so eloquently told by Parkman, reads like some old knightly romance. The warning of the
    Indian girl; the concerted attack on the garrisons; the ball play at Mackinac on the king’s birthday, and the
    massacre that followed; the siege of Fort Pitt and the heroic defense of Detroit; the bloody battle of Bushy run,
    where the painted savage recoiled before the kilted Highlander, as brave and almost as wild; Bouquet’s march into
    the forests of the Ohio, and the submission of the vanquished tribes—all these things must be passed over here. They
    have already been told by a master of language. But the contest of savagery against civilization has but one ending,
    and the scene closes with the death of Pontiac, a broken-spirited wanderer, cut down at last by a hired assassin of
    his own race, for whose crime the blood of whole tribes was poured out in atonement. (<i><a href="#Parkman">Parkman</a>, 7.</i>)</p>

    <p class="mb0">The first portrait is taken from one given in Lossing’s American Revolution and War of 1812, <span
      class="smcap">iii</span> (1875), page 189, and thus described: “The portrait of the Prophet is from a pencil
      sketch made by Pierre Le Dru, a young French trader, at Vincennes, in 1808. He made a sketch of Tecumtha at about
      the same time, both of which I found in possession of his son at Quebec in 1848, and by whom I was kindly
      permitted to copy them.” The other is a copy of the picture painted by Catlin in 1881, after the tribe had removed
      to Kansas. The artist describes him as blind in his left (?) eye, and painted him holding his medicine fire in his
      right hand and his sacred string of beans in the other.</p>

  <p>Forty years had passed away and changes had come to the western territory. The cross of Saint George, erected in
    the place of the lilies of France, had been supplanted by the flag of the young republic, which in one generation
    had extended its sway from the lakes to the gulf and from the Atlantic to the Rocky mountains. By treaties made in
    1768 with the Iroquois and Cherokee, the two leading Indian confederacies in the east, the Ohio and the Kanawha had
    been fixed as the boundary between the two races, the Indians renouncing forever their claims to the seaboard, the
    Delaware, and the Susquehanna, while they were confirmed in their possession of the Alleghany, the Ohio, and the
    great northwest. But the restless borderer would not be limited, and encroachments on the native domain were
    constantly being made, resulting in a chronic warfare which kept alive the spirit of resentment. The consequence was
    that in the final struggle of the Revolution the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_671">671</span>Indian tribes
    ranged themselves on the British side. When the war ended and a treaty of peace was made between the new government
    and the old, no provision was made for the red allies of the king, and they were left to continue the struggle
    single-handed. The Indians claimed the Ohio country as theirs by virtue of the most solemn treaties, but pioneers
    had already occupied western Pennsylvania, western Virginia, and Kentucky, and were listening with eager attention
    to the reports brought back by adventurous hunters from the fertile lands of the Muskingum and the Scioto. They
    refused to be bound by the treaties of a government they had repudiated, and the tribes of the northwest were
    obliged to fight to defend their territories. Under the able leadership of Little Turtle they twice rolled back the
    tide of white invasion, defeating two of the finest armies ever sent into the western country, until, worn out by
    twenty years of unceasing warfare, and crushed and broken by the decisive victory of Wayne at the Fallen Timbers,
    their villages in ashes and their cornfields cut down, the dispirited chiefs met their conqueror at Greenville in
    1795 and signed away the rights for which they had so long contended.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 57</span>—Greenville treaty medal, obverse and reverse.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>By this treaty, which marks the beginning of the end with the eastern tribes, the Indians renounced their claims to
    all territory east of a line running in a general way from the mouth of the Cuyahoga on Lake Erie to the mouth of
    the Kentucky on the Ohio, leaving to the whites the better portion of Ohio valley, including their favorite
    hunting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672">672</span> ground of Kentucky. The Delaware, the Wyandot, and the
    Shawano, three of the leading tribes, were almost completely shorn of their ancient inheritance and driven back as
    refugees among the Miami.</p>

  <p>The Canadian boundary had been established along the lakes; the Ohio was lost to the Indians; for them there was
    left only extermination or removal to the west. Their bravest warriors were slain. Their ablest chieftain, who had
    led them to victory against St Clair, had bowed to the inevitable, and was now regarded as one with a white man’s
    heart and a traitor to his race. A brooding dissatisfaction settled down on the tribes. Who shall deliver them from
    the desolation that has come on them?</p>

  <p>Now arose among the Shawano another prophet to point out to his people the “open door” leading to happiness. In
    November, 1805, a young man named Laulewasikaw (Lalawe′thika, a rattle or similar instrument—<i>Gatschet</i>), then
    hardly more than 30 years of age, called around him his tribesmen and their allies at their ancient capital of
    Wapakoneta, within the present limits of Ohio, and there announced himself as the bearer of a new revelation from
    the Master of Life, who had taken pity on his red children and wished to save them from the threatened destruction.
    He declared that he had been taken up to the spirit world and had been permitted to lift the veil of the past and
    the future—had seen the misery of evil doers and learned the happiness that awaited those who followed the precepts
    of the Indian god. He then began an earnest exhortation, denouncing the witchcraft practices and medicine juggleries
    of the tribe, and solemnly warning his hearers that none who had part in such things would ever taste of the future
    happiness. The firewater of the whites was poison and accursed; and those who continued its use would after death be
    tormented with all the pains of fire, while flames would continually issue from their mouths. This idea may have
    been derived from some white man’s teaching or from the Indian practice of torture by fire. The young must cherish
    and respect the aged and infirm. All property must be in common, according to the ancient law of their ancestors.
    Indian women must cease to intermarry with white men; the two races were distinct and must remain so. The white
    man’s dress, with his flint-and-steel, must be discarded for the old time buckskin and the firestick. More than
    this, every tool and every custom derived from the whites must be put away, and they must return to the methods
    which the Master of Life had taught them. When they should do all this, he promised that they would again be taken
    into the divine favor, and find the happiness which their fathers had known before the coming of the whites.
    Finally, in proof of his divine mission, he announced that he had received power to cure all diseases and to arrest
    the hand of death in sickness or on the battlefield. (<i><a href="#Drake">Drake</a></i>, <i>Tecumseh, 1.</i>) To avoid repetition, it may
    be stated that, except when otherwise noted, the principal facts concerning Tecumtha and the prophet are taken from
    Drake’s work, the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_673">673</span> valuable published on the subject. The
    prophet and his doctrines are also spoken of at some length by Tanner, Kendall, Warren, and Catlin, as hereafter
    quoted, while the history of Tecumtha is a part of the history of Ohio valley, to be found in any work treating of
    that section and period.)</p>

  <p>In an account quoted by Drake, probably from an English writer, it is stated that the prophet was noted for his
    stupidity and intoxication until his fiftieth (?) year, when one day, while lighting his pipe in his cabin, he
    suddenly fell back apparently lifeless and remained in that condition until his friends had assembled for the
    funeral, when he revived from his trance, and after quieting their alarm, announced that he had been to the spirit
    world and commanded them to call the people together that he might tell them what he had seen. When they had
    assembled, he declared that he had been conducted to the border of the spirit world by two young men, who had
    permitted him to look in upon its pleasures, but not to enter, and who, after charging him with the message to his
    people already noted, had left him, promising to visit him again at a future time. (<i><a href="#Drake">Drake</a>, Ab. Races, 1.</i>)</p>

  <p>Although the language of this account is somewhat overdrawn, the main statements are probably correct, as it is in
    complete accordance with the Indian system by which all truth has been revealed in dreams and trances from the first
    dawn of tradition down to Smohalla and the messiah of the Ghost dance.</p>

  <p>His words aroused an intense excitement among his hearers, and the impression deepened as the tidings of the new
    gospel were carried from camp to camp. Those who were addicted to drunkenness—the besetting sin of the Indians since
    their acquaintance with the whites—were so thoroughly alarmed at the prospect of a fiery punishment in the spirit
    world that for a long time intoxication became practically unknown among the western tribes. Their zeal led also to
    the inauguration of a crusade against all who were suspected of dealing in witchcraft or magic arts; but here the
    prophet took advantage of this feeling to effectually rid himself of all who opposed his sacred claims. It was only
    necessary for him to denounce such a person as a witch to have him pay the forfeit with reputation, if not with
    life.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Among the first of his victims were several Delawares—Tatepocoshe (more generally known as Teteboxti), Patterson,
      his nephew, Coltos, an old woman, and an aged man called Joshua. These were successively marked by the prophet,
      and doomed to be burnt alive. The tragedy was commenced with the old woman. The Indians roasted her slowly over a
      fire for four days, calling upon her frequently to deliver up her charm and medicine bag. Just as she was dying,
      she exclaimed that her grandson, who was then out hunting, had it in his possession. Messengers were sent in
      pursuit of him, and when found he was tied and brought into camp. He acknowledged that on one occasion he had
      borrowed the charm of his grandmother, by means of which he had flown through the air over Kentucky, to the banks
      of the Mississippi, and back again, between twilight and bedtime; but he insisted that he had returned the charm
      to its owner, and, after some consultation, he was set at liberty. The following day a council was held over the
      case of the venerable chief <span class="pagenum" id="Page_674">674</span>Tatepocoshe, he being present. His
      death was decided upon after full deliberation; and, arrayed in his finest apparel, he calmly assisted in building
      his own funeral pile, fully aware that there was no escape from the judgment that had been passed upon him. The
      respect due to his whitened locks induced his executioners to treat him with mercy. He was deliberately tomahawked
      by a young man, and his body was then placed upon the blazing fagots and consumed. The next day the old preacher
      Joshua met a similar fate. The wife of Tatepocoshe and his nephew Billy Patterson were then brought into the
      council house and seated side by side. The latter had led an irreproachable life, and died like a Christian,
      singing and praying amid the flames which destroyed his body. While preparations were making for the immolation of
      Tatepocoshe’s wife, her brother, a youth of 20 years of age, suddenly started up, took her by the hand, and, to
      the amazement of the council, led her out of the house. He soon returned, and exclaiming, “The devil has come
      among us (alluding to the prophet), and we are killing each other,” he reseated himself in the midst of the crowd.
      This bold step checked the wild frenzy of the Indians, put an end to these cruel scenes, and for a time greatly
      impaired the impostor’s influence among the Delawares. (<i><a href="#Drake">Drake</a>, Tecumseh, 2.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The prophet now changed his name to Tenskwatawa, “The Open Door” (from <i>skwa′te</i>, a door, and <i>the′nui</i>,
    to be open; frequently spelled Elskwatawa), significant of the new mode of life which he had come to point out to
    his people, and fixed his headquarters at Greenville, Ohio, where representatives from the various scattered tribes
    of the northwest gathered about him to learn the new doctrines. Some, especially the Kickapoo, entered fervently
    into his spirit, while others were disposed to oppose him. The Miami, who regarded the Shawano as intruders, were
    jealous of his influence, and the chiefs of his own tribe were somewhat inclined to consider him in the light of a
    rival. To establish his sacred character and to dispel the doubts of the unbelievers, he continued to dream dreams
    and announce wonderful revelations from time to time, when an event occurred which effectually silenced opposition
    and stamped him as one inspired.</p>

  <p>By some means he had learned that an eclipse of the sun was to take place in the summer of 1806. As the time drew
    near, he called about him the scoffers and boldly announced that on a certain day he would prove to them his
    supernatural authority by causing the sun to become dark. When the day and hour arrived and the earth at midday was
    enveloped in the gloom of twilight, Tenskwatawa, standing in the midst of the terrified Indians, pointed to the sky
    and cried, “Did I not speak truth? See, the sun is dark!” There were no more doubters now. All proclaimed him a true
    prophet and the messenger of the Master of Life. His fame spread abroad and apostles began to carry his revelations
    to the remotest tribes.</p>

  <p>We get but fragmentary light in regard to the details of the doctrine and ceremonies of this religious revival, as
    well as of that which preceded it. There were then no railroads, no newspaper correspondents to gather each day’s
    proceedings, and no telegraph to flash the news across the continent before nightfall; no reservation system, with
    its attendant army of employees, everyone a spy when an emergency arose; and no investigators to go among the tribes
    and study the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_675">675</span> matter from an ethnologic point of view. Our
    information is derived chiefly from military officers, who knew these things only as vague rumors of Indian unrest
    fomented by British agents; from the statements of a few illiterate interpreters or captives among the savages, and
    from the misty recollections of old men long after the excitement had passed away. Of the dances which are a part of
    every important Indian ceremony, the songs which they chanted, the peculiar dress or adornments which probably
    distinguished the believers—of all these we know nothing; but we may well surmise that the whole elaborate system of
    Indian mythology and ceremonial was brought into play to give weight to the words of the prophet, and enough is
    known to show that in its leading features the movement closely resembled the modern Ghost dance.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to know how far the prophet was responsible for the final shaping of the doctrine. Like all such
    movements, it undoubtedly grew and took more definite form under the hands of the apostles who went out from the
    presence of its originator to preach to the various tribes. A religion which found adherents alike in the everglades
    of Florida and on the plains of the Saskatchewan must necessarily have undergone local modifications. From a
    comparison of the various accounts we can arrive at a general statement of the belief.</p>

  <p>The prophet was held to be an incarnation of Manabozho, the great “first doer” of the Algonquian system. His words
    were believed to be the direct utterances of a deity. Manabozho had taught his people certain modes of living best
    suited to their condition and capacity. A new race had come upon them, and the Indians had thrown aside their
    primitive purity of life and adopted the innovations of the whites, which had now brought them to degradation and
    misery and threatened them with swift and entire destruction. To punish them for their disobedience and bring them
    to a sense of their duty, Manabozho had called the game from the forests and shut it up under the earth, so that the
    tribes were now on the verge of starvation and obliged to eat the flesh of filthy hogs. They had also lost their old
    love for one another and become addicted to the secret practices of the poisoner and the wizard, together with the
    abominable ceremonies of the calumet dance. They must now put aside all these things, throw away the weapons and the
    dress of the white man, pluck out their hair as in ancient times, wear the eagle feather on their heads, and clothe
    themselves again with the breechcloth and the skins of animals slain with the bows and arrows which Manabozho had
    given them. (<i><a href="#Kendall">Kendall</a>, 1.</i>) They must have done with the white man’s flint-and-steel, and cook their food over
    a fire made by rubbing together two sticks, and this fire must always be kept burning in their lodges, as it was a
    symbol of the eternal life, and their care for it was an evidence of their heed to the divine commands. The
    firewater must forever be put away, together with the medicine bags and poisons and the wicked juggleries which had
    corrupted the ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_676">676</span> purity of the Midé rites. Instead of these
    the prophet gave them new songs and new medicines. Their women must cease from any connection with white men. They
    were to love one another and make an end of their constant wars, to be kind to their children, to keep but one dog
    in a family, and to abstain from lying and stealing. If they would listen to his voice and follow his instructions,
    the incarnate Manabozho promised that at the end of four years (i.&nbsp;e., in 1811) he would bring on two days of
    darkness, during which he would travel invisibly throughout the land, and cause the animals which he had created to
    come forth again out of the earth. (<i><a href="#Kendall">Kendall</a>, 2.</i>) They were also promised that their dead friends would be
    restored to them.</p>

  <p>The ideas as to the catastrophe that was to usher in the new era seem to have varied according to the interpreter
    of the belief. Among the Ottawa, and perhaps among the lake tribes generally, there was to be a period of darkness,
    as already stated. Among the Cherokee, and probably also among the Creek, it was believed that there would be a
    terrible hailstorm, which would overwhelm with destruction both the whites and the unbelievers of the red race,
    while the elect would be warned in time to save themselves by fleeing to the high mountain tops. The idea of any
    hostile combination against the white race seems to have been no part of the doctrine. In the north, however, there
    is always a plain discrimination against the Americans. The Great Father, through his prophet, is represented as
    declaring himself to be the common parent alike of Indians, English, French, and Spaniards; while the Americans, on
    the contrary, “are not my children, but the children of the evil spirit. They grew from the scum of the great water,
    when it was troubled by an evil spirit and the froth was driven into the woods by a strong east wind. They are
    numerous, but I hate them. They are unjust; they have taken away your lands, which were not made for them.”
    (<i><a href="#Kendall">Kendall</a>, 3.</i>)</p>

  <p>From the venerable James Wafford, of the Cherokee nation, the author in 1891 obtained some interesting details in
    regard to the excitement among the Cherokee. According to his statement, the doctrine first came to them through the
    Creek about 1812 or 1813. It was probably given to the Creek by Tecumtha and his party on their visit to that tribe
    in the fall of 1811, as will be related hereafter. The Creek were taught by their prophets that the old Indian life
    was soon to return, when “instead of beef and bacon they would have venison, and instead of chickens they would have
    turkeys.” Great sacred dances were inaugurated, and the people were exhorted to be ready for what was to come. From
    the south the movement spread to the Cherokee, and one of their priests, living in what is now upper Georgia, began
    to preach that on a day near at hand there would be a terrible storm, with a mighty wind and hailstones as large as
    hominy mortars, which would destroy from the face of the earth all but the true believers who had previously taken
    refuge on the highest summits of the Great Smoky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_677">677</span> mountains. Full
    of this belief, numbers of the tribe in Alabama and Georgia abandoned their bees, their orchards, their slaves, and
    everything else that might have come to them through the white man, and, in spite of the entreaties and
    remonstrances of friends who put no faith in the prediction, took up their toilsome march for the mountains of
    Carolina. Wafford, who was then about 10 years of age, lived with his mother and stepfather on Valley river, and
    vividly remembers the troops of pilgrims, with their packs on their backs, fleeing from the lower country to escape
    from the wrath to come. Many of them stopped at the house of his stepfather, who, being a white man, was somewhat
    better prepared than his neighbors to entertain travelers, and who took the opportunity to endeavor to persuade them
    to turn back, telling them that their hopes and fears alike were groundless. Some listened to him and returned to
    their homes, but others went on and climbed the mountain, where they waited until the appointed day arrived, only to
    find themselves disappointed. Slowly and sadly then they took up their packs once more and turned their faces
    homeward, dreading the ridicule they were sure to meet there, but yet believing in their hearts that the glorious
    coming was only postponed for a time. This excitement among the Cherokee is noted at some length in the Cherokee
    Advocate of November 16, 1844, published at Tahlequah, Cherokee Nation. Among the Creek the excitement, intensified
    by reports of the struggle now going on in the north, and fostered and encouraged by the emissaries of Spain and
    England, grew and spread until it culminated in the summer of 1813 in the terrible Creek war.</p>

  <p>Enough is known of the ceremonial of this religion to show that it must have had an elaborate ritual. We learn from
    Warren that the adherents of the prophet were accustomed to perform certain ceremonies in solemn councils, and that,
    after he had prohibited the corrupt secret rites, he introduced instead new medicines and songs, and that at the
    ancient capital of the Ojibwa on Lake Superior the Indians collected in great numbers and performed these dances and
    ceremonies day and night. (<i><a href="#Warren">Warren</a>, 1.</i>) They were also instructed to dance naked, with their bodies painted
    and with the warclub in their hands. (<i><a href="#Kendall">Kendall</a>, 4.</i>) The solemn rite of confirmation, known as “shaking hands
    with the prophet,” was particularly impressive. From the narrative of John Tanner, a white man captured when a child
    from his home in Kentucky and brought up among the wild Ojibwa, we get the best contemporary account of the advent
    of the new doctrine in the north and its effect on the lake tribes. He says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It was while I was living here at Great Wood river that news came of a great man among the Shawneese, who had
      been favoured by a revelation of the mind and will of the Great Spirit. I was hunting in the prairie, at a great
      distance from my lodge, when I saw a stranger approaching. At first I was apprehensive of an enemy, but as he drew
      nearer, his dress showed him to be an Ojibbeway; but when he came up, there was something very strange and
      peculiar in his manner. He signified to me that I must go home, but gave no explanation of the cause. He refused
      to look at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_678">678</span>me or enter into any kind of conversation. I thought
      he must be crazy, but nevertheless accompanied him to my lodge. When we had smoked, he remained a long time
      silent, but at last began to tell me he had come with a message from the prophet of the Shawneese. “Henceforth,”
      said he, “the fire must never be suffered to go out in your lodge. Summer and winter, day and night, in the storm,
      or when it is calm, you must remember that the life in your body and the fire in your lodge are the same and of
      the same date. If you suffer your fire to be extinguished, at that moment your life will be at its end. You must
      not suffer a dog to live; you must never strike either a man, a woman, a child, or a dog. The prophet himself is
      coming to shake hands with you; but I have come before, that you may know what is the will of the Great Spirit,
      communicated to us by him, and to inform you that the preservation of your life, for a single moment, depends on
      your entire obedience. From this time forward we are neither to be drunk, to steal, to lie, or to go against our
      enemies. While we yield an entire obedience to these commands of the Great Spirit, the Sioux, even if they come to
      our country, will not be able to see us; we shall be protected and made happy.” I listened to all he had to say,
      but told him, in answer, that I could not believe we should all die in case our fire went out; in many instances,
      also, it would be difficult to avoid punishing our children; our dogs were useful in aiding us to hunt and take
      animals, so that I could not believe the Great Spirit had any wish to take them from us. He continued talking to
      us until late at night; then he lay down to sleep in my lodge. I happened to wake first in the morning, and,
      perceiving the fire had gone out, I called him to get up and see how many of us were living and how many dead. He
      was prepared for the ridicule I attempted to throw upon his doctrine, and told me that I had not yet shaken hands
      with the prophet. His visit had been to prepare me for this important event, and to make me aware of the
      obligations and risks I should incur, by entering into the engagement implied in taking in my hand the message of
      the prophet. I did not rest entirely easy in my unbelief. The Indians, generally, received the doctrine of this
      man with great humility and fear. Distress and anxiety was visible in every countenance. Many killed their dogs,
      and endeavored to practice obedience to all the commands of this new preacher, who still remained among us. But,
      as was usual with me, in any emergency of this kind, I went to the traders, firmly believing that if the Deity had
      any communications to make to men, they would be given, in the first instance, to white men. The traders ridiculed
      and despised the idea of a new revelation of the Divine will, and the thought that it should be given to a poor
      Shawnee. Thus was I confirmed in my infidelity. Nevertheless, I did not openly avow my unbelief to the Indians,
      only I refused to kill my dogs, and showed no great degree of anxiety to comply with his other requirements. As
      long as I remained among the Indians, I made it my business to conform, as far as appeared consistent with my
      immediate convenience and comfort, with all their customs. Many of their ideas I have adopted, but I always found
      among them opinions which I could not hold. The Ojibbeway whom I have mentioned remained some time among the
      Indians in my neighborhood, and gained the attention of the principal men so effectually that a time was appointed
      and a lodge prepared for the solemn and public espousing of the doctrines of the prophet. When the people, and I
      among them, were brought into the long lodge, prepared for this solemnity, we saw something carefully concealed
      under a blanket, in figure and dimensions bearing some resemblance to the form of a man. This was accompanied by
      two young men, who, it was understood, attended constantly upon it, made its bed at night, as for a man, and slept
      near it. But while we remained no one went near it or raised the blanket which was spread over its unknown
      contents. Four strings of mouldy and discoloured beans were all the remaining visible insignia of this important
      mission. After a long harangue, in which the prominent features of the new revelation were stated and urged upon
      the attention of all, the four strings of beans, which we were told were made of the flesh itself of the prophet,
      were carried with much solemnity to each man in the lodge, and he was expected to take hold of each string at the
      top, and draw them gently through his hand. This was called shaking hands with <span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_679">679</span>the prophet, and was considered as solemnly engaging to obey his injunctions, and
      accept his mission as from the Supreme. All the Indians who touched the beans had previously killed their dogs;
      they gave up their medicine bags, and showed a disposition to comply with all that should be required of them.</p>

    <p>We had now been for some time assembled in considerable numbers. Much agitation and terror had prevailed among
      us, and now famine began to be felt. The faces of men wore an aspect of unusual gloominess; the active became
      indolent, and the spirits of the bravest seemed to be subdued. I started to hunt with my dogs, which I had
      constantly refused to kill or suffer to be killed. By their assistance, I found and killed a bear. On returning
      home, I said to some of the Indians, “Has not the Great Spirit given us our dogs to aid us in procuring what is
      needful for the support of our life, and can you believe he wishes now to deprive us of their services? The
      prophet, we are told, has forbid us to suffer our fire to be extinguished in our lodges, and when we travel or
      hunt, he will not allow us to use a flint and steel, and we are told he requires that no man should give fire to
      another. Can it please the Great Spirit that we should lie in our hunting camps without fire, or is it more
      agreeable to him that we should make fire by rubbing together two sticks than with a flint and a piece of steel?”
      But they would not listen to me; and the serious enthusiasm which prevailed among them so far affected me that I
      threw away my flint and steel, laid aside my medicine bag, and, in many particulars, complied with the new
      doctrines; but I would not kill my dogs. I soon learned to kindle a fire by rubbing some dry cedar, which I was
      careful to carry always about me, but the discontinuance of the use of flint and steel subjected many of the
      Indians to much inconvenience and suffering. The influence of the Shawnee prophet was very sensibly and painfully
      felt by the remotest Ojibbeways of whom I had any knowledge, but it was not the common impression among them that
      his doctrines had any tendency to unite them in the accomplishment of any human purpose. For two or three years
      drunkenness was much less frequent than formerly, war was less thought of, and the entire aspect of affairs among
      them was somewhat changed by the influence of one man. But gradually the impression was obliterated; medicine
      bags, flints, and steels were resumed; dogs were raised, women and children were beaten as before, and the Shawnee
      prophet was despised. At this day he is looked upon by the Indians as an impostor and a bad man. (<i><a href="#Tanner">Tanner</a>,

  </blockquote>

  <p>Tanner’s account is confirmed by Warren, from the statements of old men among the Ojibwa who had taken part in the
    revival. According to their story the ambassadors of the new revelation appeared at the different villages, acting
    strangely and with their faces painted black—perhaps to signify their character as messengers from the world of
    shades. They told the people that they must light a fire with two dry sticks in each of their principal settlements,
    and that this fire must always be kept sacred and burning. They predicted the speedy return of the old Indian life,
    and asserted that the prophet would cause the dead to rise from the grave. The new belief took sudden and complete
    possession of the minds of the Ojibwa and spread “like wildfire” from end to end of their widely extended territory,
    and even to the remote northern tribes in alliance with the Cree and Asiniboin. The strongest evidence of their
    implicit obedience to the new revelation was given by their attention to the command to throw away their medicine
    bags, the one thing which every Indian holds most sacred. It is said that the shores of Lake Superior, in the
    vicinity of the great village of Shagawaumikong (Bayfield, Wisconsin), were strewn with these medicine bags, which
    had been cast into the water. At this ancient capital of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_680">680</span> the
    tribe the Ojibwa gathered in great numbers, to dance the dances and sing the songs of the new ritual, until a
    message was received from the prophet inviting them to come to him at Detroit, where he would explain in person the
    will of the Master of Life. This was in 1808. The excitement was now at fever heat, and it was determined to go in a
    body to Detroit. It is said that 150 canoe loads of Ojibwa actually started on this pilgrimage, and one family even
    brought with them a dead child to be restored to life by the prophet. They had proceeded a considerable distance
    when they were met by an influential French trader, who reported, on the word of some who had already visited the
    prophet’s camp and returned, that the devotees there were on the brink of starvation—which was true, as the great
    multitude had consumed their entire supply of provisions, and had been so occupied with religious ceremonies that
    they had neglected to plant their corn. It was also asserted that during the prophet’s frequent periods of absence
    from the camp, when he would disappear for several days, claiming on his return that he had been to the spirit world
    in converse with the Master of Life, that he was really concealed in a hollow log in the woods. This is quite
    probable, and entirely consistent with the Indian theory of trances and soul pilgrimages while the body remains
    unconscious in one spot. These reports, however, put such a damper on the ardor of the Ojibwa that they returned to
    their homes and gradually ceased to think about the new revelation. As time went on a reaction set in, and those who
    had been most active evangelists of the doctrine among the tribe became most anxious to efface the remembrance of
    it. One good, however, resulted to the Ojibwa from the throwing away of the poisonous compounds formerly in common
    use by the lower order of doctors, and secret poisoning became almost unknown. (<i><a href="#Warren">Warren</a>, 2.</i>)</p>

  <p>When the celebrated traveler Catlin went among the prairie tribes some thirty years later, he found that the
    prophet’s emissaries—he says the prophet himself, which is certainly a mistake—had carried the living fire, the
    sacred image, and the mystic strings (see portrait and description) even to the Blackfeet on the plains of the
    Saskatchewan, going without hindrance among warring tribes where the name of the Shawano had never been spoken,
    protected only by the reverence that attached to their priestly character. There seems no doubt that by this time
    they had developed the plan of a confederacy for driving back the whites, and Catlin asserts that thousands of
    warriors among those remote tribes had pledged themselves to fight under the lead of Tecumtha at the proper time.
    His account of the prophet’s methods in the extreme northwest agrees with what Tanner has reported from the Ojibwa
    country. (<i><a href="#Catlin">Catlin</a>, 1.</i>) But disaster followed him like a shadow. Rivals, jealous of his success, came after him
    to denounce his plans as visionary and himself as an impostor. The ambassadors were obliged to turn back to save
    their lives and retrace their way in haste to the far distant Wabash, where the fatal battle of Tippecanoe and the
    death of his great brother, Tecumtha, put an end to all his splendid dreams.</p>

      TECUMTHA AND TIPPECANOE</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subhead">
    <p>These lands are ours. No one has a right to remove us, because we were the first owners.—<i>Tecumtha to Wells, 1807.</i></p>

    <p>The Great Spirit gave this great island to his red children. He placed the whites on the other side of the big
      water. They were not contented with their own, but came to take ours from us. They have driven us from the sea to
      the lakes—we can go no farther.—<i>Tecumtha, 1810.</i></p>

    <p>The President may sit still in his town and drink his wine, while you and I will have to fight it
      out.—<i>Tecumtha to Harrison, 1810.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>And now we begin to hear of the prophet’s brother, Tecumtha, the most heroic character in Indian history. Tecumtha,
    “The Meteor,” was the son of a chief and the worthy scion of a warrior race. His tribe, the Shawano, made it their
    proud boast that they of all tribes had opposed the most determined resistance to the encroachments of the whites.
    His father had fallen under the bullets of the Virginians while leading his warriors at the bloody battle of Point
    Pleasant, in 1774. His eldest and dearest brother had lost his life in an attack on a southern frontier post, and
    another had been killed fighting by his side at Wayne’s victory in 1794. What wonder that the young Tecumtha
    declared that his flesh crept at the sight of a white man!</p>

  <p>But his was no mean spirit of personal revenge; his mind was too noble for that. He hated the whites as the
    destroyers of his race, but prisoners and the defenseless knew well that they could rely on his honor and humanity
    and were safe under his protection. When only a boy—for his military career began in childhood—he had witnessed the
    burning of a prisoner, and the spectacle was so abhorrent to his feelings that by an earnest and eloquent harangue
    he induced the party to give up the practice forever. In later years his name was accepted by helpless women and
    children as a guaranty of protection even in the midst of hostile Indians. Of commanding figure, nearly six feet in
    height and compactly built; of dignified bearing and piercing eye, before whose lightning even a British general
    quailed; with the fiery eloquence of a Clay and the clear-cut logic of a Webster; abstemious in habit, charitable in
    thought and action, brave as a lion, but humane and generous withal—in a word, an aboriginal American knight—his
    life was given to his people, and he fell at last, like his father and his brothers before him, in battle with the
    destroyers of his nation, the champion of a lost cause and a dying race.</p>

  <p>His name has been rendered “The Shooting Star” and “The Panther Crouching, or Lying in Wait.” From a reply to a
    letter of inquiry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_682">682</span> addressed to Professor A. S. Gatschet, the
    well-known philologist, I extract the following, which throws valuable light on the name system and mythology of the
    Shawano, and shows also that the two renderings, apparently so dissimilar, have a common origin:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Shawano personal names are nearly all clan names, and by their interpretation the clan to which the individual or
      his father or mother belongs may be discovered. Thus, when a man is called “tight fitting” or “good fit,” he is of
      the <i>Rabbit</i> clan, because the fur fits the rabbit very tightly and closely. The name of Tecumtha is derived
      from <i>nila ni tka′mthka</i>, “I cross the path or way of somebody, or of an animal.” This indicates that the one
      so named belongs to the clan of the round-foot or claw-foot animals, as panther, lion, or even raccoon. Tecumtha
      and his brother belonged to the clan of the manetuwi msipessi or “miraculous panther” (<i>msi</i>, great, big;
      <i>pishiwi</i>, abbreviated <i>pessi</i>, cat, both combined meaning the American lion). So the translations
      “panther lying in wait,” or “crouching lion,” give only the sense of the name, and no animal is named in it. But
      the <i>msi-pessi</i>, when the epithet miraculous (<i>manetuwi</i>) is added to it, means a “celestial tiger,” i.&nbsp;e.,
      a meteor or shooting star. The <i>manetuwi msi-pessi</i> lives in water only and is visible not as an <span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_683">683</span>animal, but as a shooting star, and exceeding in size other
      shooting stars. This monster gave name to a Shawano clan, and this clan, to which Tecumtha belonged, was classed
      among the claw-foot animals also. The quick motion of the shooting star was correctly likened to that of a tiger
      or wildcat rushing upon his prey. Shooting stars are supposed to be souls of great men all over America. The home
      of the dead is always in the west, where the celestial bodies set, and since meteors travel westward they were
      supposed to return to their western home.</p>

    <div class="center">EXPLANATION OF FIGURE 58</div>

    <p>This portrait is a copy of the one given by Lossing in his American Revolution and the War of 1812, <span
      class="smcap">iii.</span> (1875), page 283. He quotes a description of Tecumtha’s personal appearance by a
      British officer who saw him in 1812, and then goes on to give the history of the portrait. “Captain J. B. Glegg,
      Brock’s aid-de-camp, has left on record the following description of Tecumtha at that interview: ‘Tecumseh’s
      appearance was very prepossessing; his figure light and finely proportioned; his age I imagined to be about five
      and thirty [he was about forty]; in height, 5 feet 9 or 10 inches; his complexion light copper; countenance oval,
      with bright hazel eyes, bearing cheerfulness, energy, and decision. Three small silver crosses or coronets were
      suspended from the lower cartilage of his aquiline nose, and a large silver medallion of George the Third, which I
      believe his ancestor had received from Lord Dorchester when governor-general of Canada, was attached to a
      mixed-colored wampum string and hung round his neck. His dress consisted of a plain, neat uniform, tanned deerskin
      jacket, with long trowsers of the same material, the seams of both being covered with neatly cut fringe, and he
      had on his feet leather moccasins, much ornamented with work made from the dyed quills of the porcupine.’ The
      portrait of Tecumtha above given is from a pencil sketch by Pierre Le Dru.... In this I have given only the head
      by Le Dru. The cap was red, and in front was a single eagle’s feather, black, with a white tip. The sketch of his
      dress (and the medal above described), in which he appears as a brigadier-general of the British army, is from a
      rough drawing, which I saw in Montreal in the summer of 1858, made at Malden soon after the surrender of Detroit,
      where the Indians celebrated that event by a grand feast. It was only on gala occasions that Tecumtha was seen in
      full dress. The sketch did not pretend to give a true likeness of the chief, and was valuable only as a
      delineation of his costume. From the two we are enabled to give a pretty faithful picture of the great Shawnoese
      warrior and statesman as he appeared in his best mood. When in full dress he wore a cocked hat and plume, but
      would not give up his blue breechcloth, red leggings fringed with buckskin, and buckskin moccasins.”</p>
  </div>

  <p>Tecumtha was now in the prime of manhood, being about 40 years of age, and had already thought out his scheme of
    uniting all the tribes in one grand confederation to resist the further encroachments of the whites, on the
    principle that the Indians had common interests, and that what concerned one tribe concerned all. As the tribes were
    constantly shifting about, following the game in its migrations, he held that no one tribe had any more than a
    possessory right to the land while in actual occupancy, and that any sale of lands, to be valid, must be sanctioned
    by all the tribes concerned. His claim was certainly founded in justice, but the government refused to admit the
    principle in theory, although repeatedly acting on it in practice, for every important treaty afterward made in
    Mississippi valley was a joint treaty, as it was found impossible to assign the ownership of any considerable
    section to any one particular tribe. The Shawano themselves hunted from the Cumberland to the Susquehanna. As a
    basal proposition, Tecumtha claimed that the Greenville treaty, having been forced on the Indians, was invalid; that
    the only true boundary was the Ohio, as established in 1768, and that all future cessions must have the sanction of
    all the tribes claiming rights in that region.</p>

  <p>By this time there were assembled at Greenville to listen to the teachings of the prophet hundreds of savages,
    representing all the widely extended tribes of the late region and the great northwest, all wrought up to the
    highest pitch of excitement over the prospect of a revival of the old Indian life and the perpetuation of aboriginal
    sovereignty. This was Tecumtha’s opportunity, and he was quick to improve it. Even those who doubted the spiritual
    revelations could see that they were in danger from the continued advances of the whites, and were easily convinced
    that safety required that they should unite as one people for the preservation of a common boundary. The pilgrims
    carried back these ideas to their several tribes, and thus what was at first a simple religious revival soon became
    a political agitation. They were equally patriotic from the Indian point of view, and under the circumstances one
    was almost the natural complement of the other. All the evidence goes to show that the movement in its inception was
    purely religious and peaceable; but the military spirit of Tecumtha afterward gave to it a warlike and even
    aggressive character, and henceforth the apostles of the prophet became also recruiting agents for his brother.
    Tecumtha himself was too sensible to think that the whites would be destroyed by any interposition of heaven, or
    that they could be driven out by any combination of the Indians, but he did believe it possible<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_684">684</span> that the westward advance of the Americans could be stopped at the Ohio, leaving his
    people in undisturbed possession of what lay beyond. In this hope he was encouraged by the British officials in
    Canada, and it is doubtful if the movement would ever have become formidable if it had not been incited and assisted
    from across the line.</p>

  <p>In the spring of 1807 it was estimated that at Fort Wayne fifteen hundred Indians had recently passed that post on
    their way to visit the prophet, while councils were constantly being held and runners were going from tribe to tribe
    with pipes and belts of wampum. It was plain that some uncommon movement was going on among them, and it also was
    evident that the British agents had a hand in keeping up the excitement. The government became alarmed, and the
    crisis came when an order was sent from the President to Tecumtha at Greenville to remove his party beyond the
    boundary of 1795 (the Greenville treaty). Trembling with excitement, Tecumtha rose and addressed his followers in a
    passionate speech, dwelling on the wrongs of the Indians and the continued encroachments of the whites. Then,
    turning to the messenger, he said, “These lands are ours. No one has a right to remove us, because we were the first
    owners. The Great Spirit above has appointed this place for us, on which to light our fires, and here we will
    remain. As to boundaries, the Great Spirit above knows no boundaries nor will his red children acknowledge any.”
    (<i><a href="#Drake">Drake</a>, Tecumseh, 3.</i>) From this time it was understood that the Indians were preparing to make a final stand
    for the valley of the Ohio. The prophet continued to arouse their enthusiasm by his inspired utterances, while
    Tecumtha became the general and active organizer of the warriors. At a conference with the governor of Ohio in the
    autumn of 1807 he fearlessly denied the validity of the former treaties, and declared his intention to resist the
    further extension of the white settlements on Indian lands.</p>

  <p>The next spring great numbers of Indians came down from the lakes to visit Tecumtha and his brother, who, finding
    their following increasing so rapidly, accepted an invitation from the Potawatomi and Kickapoo, and removed their
    headquarters to a more central location on the Wabash. The Delaware and Miami, who claimed precedence in that region
    and who had all along opposed the prophet and Tecumtha, protested against this move, but without effect. The new
    settlement, which was on the western bank of the river, just below the mouth of the Tippecanoe, was known to the
    Indians as Kehtipaquononk, “the great clearing,” and was an old and favorite location with them. It had been the
    site of a large Shawano village which had been destroyed by the Americans in 1791, and some years later the
    Potawatomi had rebuilt upon the same place, to which they now invited the disciples of the new religion. The whites
    had corrupted the name to Tippecanoe, and it now generally became known as the Prophet’s town.</p>

  <p>Nothing else of moment occurred during this year, but it was learned that Tecumtha contemplated visiting the
    southern tribes in the near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_685">685</span> future to enlist them also in his
    confederacy. In 1809, however, rumors of an approaching outbreak began to fill the air, and it was evident that the
    British were instigating the Indians to mischief in anticipation of a war between England and the United States.
    Just at this juncture the anger of Tecumtha’s party was still further inflamed by the negotiation of treaties with
    four tribes by which additional large tracts were ceded in Indiana and Illinois. The Indians now refused to buy
    ammunition from the American traders, saying that they could obtain all they wanted for nothing in another quarter.
    In view of the signs of increasing hostility, Governor Harrison was authorized to take such steps as might be
    necessary to protect the frontier. Tecumtha had now gained over the Wyandot, the most influential tribe of the Ohio
    region, the keepers of the great wampum belt of union and the lighters of the council fire of the allied tribes.
    Their example was speedily followed by the Miami, whose adhesion made the tribes of the Ohio and the lakes
    practically unanimous. The prophet now declared that he would follow in the steps of Pontiac, and called on the
    remote tribes to assist those on the border to roll back the tide which would otherwise overwhelm them all. In
    return, the Sauk and Fox sent word that they were ready whenever he should say the word.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1810, according to a previous arrangement, Tecumtha, attended by several hundred warriors,
    descended the river to Vincennes to confer with Governor Harrison on the situation. The conference began on the 15th
    of August and lasted three days. Tecumtha reiterated his former claims, saying that in uniting the tribes he was
    endeavoring to dam the mighty water that was ready to overflow his people. The Americans had driven the Indians from
    the sea and threatened to push them into the lakes; and, although he disclaimed any intention of making war against
    the United States, he declared his fixed resolution to insist on the old boundary and to oppose the further
    intrusion of the whites on the lands of the Indians, and to resist the survey of the lands recently ceded. He was
    followed by chiefs of five different tribes, each of whom in turn declared that he would support the principles of
    Tecumtha. Harrison replied that the government would never admit that any section belonged to all the Indians in
    common, and that, having bought the ceded lands from the tribes who were first found in possession of them, it would
    defend its title by arms. To this Tecumtha said that he preferred to be on the side of the Americans, and that if
    his terms were conceded he would bring his forces to the aid of the United States in the war which he knew was soon
    to break out with England, but that otherwise he would be compelled to join the British. The governor replied that
    he would state the case to the President, but that it was altogether unlikely that he would consent to the
    conditions. Recognizing the inevitable, Tecumtha expressed the hope that, as the President was to determine the
    matter, the Great Spirit would put sense into his head to induce him to give up the lands, adding,<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_686">686</span> “It is true, he is so far off he will not be injured by the war. He
    may sit still in his town and drink his wine, while you and I will have to fight it out.” The governor then
    requested that in the event of an Indian war Tecumtha would use his influence to prevent the practice of cruelties
    on women and children and defenseless prisoners. To this he readily agreed, and the promise was faithfully kept.
    (<i><a href="#Drake">Drake</a>, Tecumseh, 4.</i>)</p>

  <p>The conference had ended with a tacit understanding that war must come, and both sides began to prepare for the
    struggle. Soon after it was learned that the prophet had sent belts to the tribes west of the Mississippi, inviting
    them to join in a war against the United States. Outrages on the Indians by settlers intensified the hostile
    feeling, and the Delawares refused to deliver up a murderer until some of the whites who had killed their people
    were first punished. Harrison himself states that the Indians could rarely obtain satisfaction for the most
    unprovoked wrongs. In another letter he says that Tecumtha “has taken for his model the celebrated Pontiac, and I am
    persuaded he will bear a favorable comparison in every respect with that far-famed warrior.”</p>

  <p>In July, 1811, Tecumtha again, visited Harrison at Vincennes. In the course of his talk he said that the whites
    were unnecessarily alarmed, as the Indians were only following the example set them by the colonies in uniting for
    the furtherance of common interests. He added that he was now on his way to the southern tribes to obtain their
    adhesion also to the league, and that on his return in the spring he intended to visit the President to explain his
    purposes fully and to clear away all difficulties. In the meantime he expected that a large number of Indians would
    join his colony on the Wabash during the winter, and to avoid any danger of collision between them and the whites,
    he requested that no settlements should be made on the disputed lands until he should have an opportunity to see the
    President. To this Harrison replied that the President would never give up a country which he had bought from its
    rightful owners, nor would he suffer his people to be injured with impunity. This closed the interview, and the next
    day Tecumtha started with his party for the south to visit the Creek and Choctaw. About the same time it was learned
    that the British had sent a message to the prophet, telling him that the time had now come for him to take up the
    hatchet, and inviting him to send a party to their headquarters at Malden (now Amherstburg, Ontario) to receive the
    necessary supplies. In view of these things Harrison suggested to the War Department that opportunity be taken of
    Tecumtha’s absence in the south to strike a blow against his confederacy. Continuing in the same letter, he says of
    the great Indian leader:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The implicit obedience and respect which the followers of Tecumseh pay to him is really astonishing, and more
      than any other circumstance bespeaks him one of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_687">687</span>those uncommon
      geniuses which spring up occasionally to produce revolutions and overturn the established order of things. If it
      were not for the vicinity of the United States, he would perhaps be the founder of an empire that would rival in
      glory Mexico or Peru. No difficulties deter him. For four years he has been in constant motion. You see him to-day
      on the Wabash, and in a short time hear of him on the shores of Lake Erie or Michigan or on the banks of the
      Mississippi, and wherever he goes he makes an impression favorable to his purposes. He is now upon the last round,
      to put a finishing stroke to his work. I hope, however, before his return that that part of the fabric which he
      considered complete will be demolished, and even its foundations rooted up. (<i><a href="#Drake">Drake</a>, Tecumseh, 5.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On this trip Tecumtha went as far as Florida and engaged the Seminole for his confederacy. Then, retracing his
    steps into Alabama, he came to the ancient Creek town of Tukabachi, on the Tallapoosa, near the present site of
    Montgomery. What happened here is best told in the words of McKenney and Hall, who derived their information from
    Indians at the same town a few years later:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>He made his way to the lodge of the chief called the Big Warrior. He explained his object, delivered his war
      talk, presented a bundle of sticks, gave a piece of wampum and a war hatchet—all which the Big Warrior took—when
      Tecumthé, reading the spirit and intentions of the Big Warrior, looked him in the eye, and, pointing his finger
      toward his face, said: “Your blood is white. You have taken my talk, and the sticks, and the wampum, and the
      hatchet, but you do not mean to fight. I know the reason. You do not believe the Great Spirit has sent me. You
      shall know. I leave Tuckhabatchee directly, and shall go straight to Detroit. When I arrive there, I will stamp on
      the ground with my foot and shake down every house in Tuckhabatchee.” So saying, he turned and left the Big
      Warrior in utter amazement at both his manner and his threat, and pursued his journey. The Indians were struck no
      less with his conduct than was the Big Warrior, and began to dread the arrival of the day when the threatened
      calamity would befall them. They met often and talked over this matter, and counted the days carefully to know the
      day when Tecumthé would reach Detroit. The morning they had fixed upon as the day of his arrival at last came. A
      mighty rumbling was heard—the Indians all ran out of their houses—the earth began to shake; when at last, sure
      enough, every house in Tuckhabatchee was shaken down. The exclamation was in every mouth, “Tecumthé has got to
      Detroit!” The effect was electric. The message he had delivered to the Big Warrior was believed, and many of the
      Indians took their rifles and prepared for the war. The reader will not be surprised to learn that an earthquake
      had produced all this; but he will be, doubtless, that it should happen on the very day on which Tecumthé arrived
      at Detroit, and in exact fulfillment of his threat. It was the famous earthquake of New Madrid on the Mississippi.
      (<i><a href="#McKenney_and_Hall">McKenney and Hall</a>, 1.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The fire thus kindled among the Creek by Tecumtha was fanned into a blaze by the British and Spanish traders until
    the opening of the war of 1812 gave the opportunity for the terrible outbreak known in history as the Creek war.</p>

  <p>While Tecumtha was absent in the south, affairs were rapidly approaching a crisis on the Wabash. The border
    settlers demanded the removal of the prophet’s followers, stating in their memorial to the President that they were
    “fully convinced that the formation of this combination headed by the Shawano prophet was a British scheme, and that
    the agents of that power were constantly exciting the Indians to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_688">688</span>
    hostility against the United States.” Governor Harrison now sent messages to the different tribes earnestly warning
    them of the consequences of a hostile outbreak, but about the same time the prophet himself announced that he had
    now taken up the tomahawk against the United States, and would only lay it down with his life, unless the wrongs of
    the Indians were redressed. It was known also that he was arousing his followers to a feverish pitch of excitement
    by the daily practice of mystic rites.</p>

    <img src="images/fig59.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 59</span>—Harrison treaty pipe.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Harrison now determined to break up the prophet’s camp. Accordingly, at the head of about 900 men, including about
    250 regulars, he marched from Vincennes, and on the 5th of November, 1811, encamped within a few miles of the
    prophet’s town. The Indians had fortified the place with great care and labor. It was sacred to them as the spot
    where the rites of the new religion had been so long enacted, and by these rites they believed it had been rendered
    impregnable to the attacks of the white man. The next day he approached still nearer, and was met by messengers from
    the town, who stated that the prophet was anxious to avoid hostilities and had already sent a pacific message by
    several chiefs, who had unfortunately gone down on the other side of the river and thus had failed to find the
    general. A truce was accordingly agreed on until the next day, when terms of peace were to be arranged between the
    governor and the chiefs. The army encamped on a spot pointed out by the Indians, an elevated piece of ground rising
    out of a marshy prairie, within a mile of the town. Although Harrison did not believe that the Indians would make a
    night attack, yet as a precaution he had the troops sleep on their arms in order of battle.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>At 4 o’clock in the morning of the 7th, Governor Harrison, according to his practice, had risen preparatory to
      the calling up the troops, and was engaged, while drawing on his boots by the fire, in conversation with General
      Wells, Colonel Owen, and Majors Taylor and Hurst. The orderly drum had been roused for the purpose of giving the
      signal for the troops to turn out, when the attack of the Indians suddenly commenced upon the left flank of the
      camp. The whole army was instantly on its feet, the campfires were extinguished, the governor mounted his horse
      and proceeded to the point of attack. Several of the companies had taken their places in the line within forty
      seconds from the report of the first gun, and the whole of the troops were prepared for action in the course <span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_689">689</span>of two minutes, a fact as creditable to their own activity and
      bravery as to the skill and bravery of their officers. The battle soon became general, and was maintained on both
      sides with signal and even desperate valor. The Indians advanced and retreated by the aid of a rattling noise,
      made with deer hoofs, and persevered in their treacherous attack with an apparent determination to conquer or die
      upon the spot. The battle raged with unabated fury and mutual slaughter until daylight, when a gallant and
      successful charge by our troops drove the enemy into the swamp and put an end to the conflict.</p>

    <p>Prior to the assault the prophet had given assurances to his followers that in the coming contest the Great
      Spirit would render the arms of the Americans unavailing; that their bullets would fall harmless at the feet of
      the Indians; that the latter should have light in abundance, while the former would be involved in thick darkness.
      Availing himself of the privilege conferred by his peculiar office, and perhaps unwilling in his own person to
      attest at once the rival powers of a sham prophecy and a real American bullet, he prudently took a position on an
      adjacent eminence, and when the action began, he entered upon the performance of certain mystic rites, at the same
      time singing a war song. In the course of the engagement he was informed that his men were falling. He told them
      to fight on—it would soon be as he had predicted. And then, in louder and wilder strains, his inspiring battle
      song was heard commingling with the sharp crack of the rifle and the shrill war whoop of his brave but deluded
      followers. (<i><a href="#Drake">Drake</a>, Tecumseh, 6.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Drake estimates the whole number of Indians engaged in the battle at between 800 and 1,000, representing all the
    principal tribes of the region, and puts the killed at probably not less than 50, with an unusually large proportion
    of wounded. Harrison’s estimate would seem to put the numbers much higher. The Americans lost 60 killed or mortally
    wounded, and 188 in all. (<i><a href="#Drake">Drake</a>, Tecumseh, 7.</i>) In their hurried retreat the Indians left a large number of
    dead on the field. Believing on the word of the prophet that they would receive supernatural aid from above, they
    had fought with desperate bravery, and their defeat completely disheartened them. They at once abandoned their town
    and dispersed, each to his own tribe. Tecumtha’s great fabric was indeed demolished, and even its foundations rooted
    up.</p>

  <p>The night before the engagement the prophet had performed some medicine rites by virtue of which he had assured his
    followers that half of the soldiers were already dead and the other half bereft of their senses, so that the Indians
    would have little to do but rush into their camp and finish them with the hatchet. The result infuriated the
    savages. They refused to listen to the excuses which are always ready to the tongue of the unsuccessful
    medicine-man, denounced him as a liar, and even threatened him with death. Deserted by all but a few of his own
    tribe, warned away from several villages toward which he turned his steps, he found refuge at last among a small
    band of Wyandot; but his influence and his sacred prestige were gone forever, and he lived out his remaining days in
    the gloom of obscurity.</p>

  <p>From the south Tecumtha returned through Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois, everywhere making accessions to his cause,
    but reached the Wabash at last, just a few days after the battle, only to find his followers scattered to the four
    winds, his brother a refugee, and the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_690">690</span> object of his life—a
    confederation of all the tribes—brought to nothing. His grief and disappointment were bitter. He reproached his
    brother in unmeasured terms for disobeying his instructions to preserve peace in his absence, and when the prophet
    attempted to reply, it is said that Tecumtha so far forgot his dignity as to seize his brother by the hair and give
    him a violent shaking, threatening to take his life.</p>

  <p>Early in 1812 Tecumtha sent a message to Governor Harrison, informing him of his return from the south, and stating
    that he was now ready to make the proposed visit to the President. To this Harrison replied, giving his permission,
    but refusing to allow any party to accompany him. This stipulation did not please the great leader, who had been
    accustomed to the attendance of a retinue of warriors wherever he went. He declined the terms, and thus terminated
    his intercourse with the governor. In June, 1812, he visited the agent at Fort Wayne, and there reiterated the
    justice of his position in regard to the ownership of the Indian lands, again disclaimed having had any intention of
    making war against the United States, and reproached Harrison for marching against his people in his absence. In
    return, the agent endeavored to persuade him now to join forces with the United States in the approaching conflict
    with England. “Tecumtha listened with frigid indifference, made a few general remarks in reply, and then with a
    haughty air left the council house and took his departure for Malden, where he joined the British standard.”
    (<i><a href="#Drake">Drake</a>, Tecumseh, 8.</i>) His subsequent career is a part of the history of the war of 1812.</p>

  <p>Formal declaration of war against Great Britain was made by the United States on June 18, 1812. Tecumtha was
    already at Malden, the British headquarters on the Canadian side, and when invited by some friendly Indians to
    attend a council near Detroit in order to make arrangements for remaining neutral, he sent back word that he had
    taken sides with the king, and that his bones would bleach on the Canadian shore before he would recross the river
    to join in any council of neutrality. A few days later he led his Indians into battle on the British side. For his
    services at Maguaga he was soon afterward regularly commissioned a brigadier general in the British army.</p>

  <p>We pass over the numerous events of this war—Maguaga, the Raisin, Fort Meigs, Perry’s victory—as being outside the
    scope of our narrative, and come to the battle of the Thames, October 5, 1813, the last ever fought by Tecumtha.
    After Perry’s decisive victory on the lake, Proctor hastily prepared to retreat into the interior, despite the
    earnest protests of Tecumtha, who charged him with cowardice, an imputation which the British general did not dare
    to resent. The retreat was begun with Harrison in close pursuit, until the British and Indians reached a spot on the
    north bank of the Thames, in the vicinity of the present Chatham, Ontario. Here, finding the ground favorable for
    defense, Tecumtha resolved to retreat no farther, and practically compelled Proctor to make a stand. The Indian
    leader had no hope of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_691">691</span> triumph in the issue. His sun had gone
    down, and he felt himself already standing in the shadow of death. He was done with life and desired only to close
    it, as became a warrior, striking a last blow against the hereditary enemy of his race. When he had posted his men,
    he called his chiefs about him and calmly said, “Brother warriors, we are now about to enter into an engagement from
    which I shall never come out—my body will remain on the field of battle.” He then unbuckled his sword, and, placing
    it in the hands of one of them, said, “When my son becomes a noted warrior and able to wield a sword, give this to
    him.” He then laid aside his British military dress and took his place in the line, clothed only in the ordinary
    deerskin hunting shirt. (<i><a href="#Drake">Drake</a>, Tecumseh, 9.</i>) When the battle began, his voice was heard encouraging his men
    until he fell under the cavalry charge of the Americans, who had already broken the ranks of the British regulars
    and forced them to surrender. Deprived of their leader and deserted by their white allies, the Indians gave up the
    unequal contest and fled from the field. Tecumtha died in his forty-fourth year.</p>

  <p>After the close of the war the prophet returned from Canada by permission of this government and rejoined his tribe
    in Ohio, with whom he removed to the west in 1827. (<i><a href="#Schoolcraft">Schoolcraft</a>, Ind. Tribes, 2.</i>) Catlin, who met and talked
    with him in 1832, thus speaks of him:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This, no doubt, has been a very shrewd and influential man, but circumstances have destroyed him, as they have
      many other great men before him, and he now lives respected, but silent and melancholy, in his tribe. I conversed
      with him a great deal about his brother Tecumseh, of whom he spoke frankly, and seemingly with great pleasure; but
      of himself and his own great schemes he would say nothing. He told me that Tecumseh’s plans were to embody all the
      Indian tribes in a grand confederacy, from the province of Mexico to the Great Lakes, to unite their forces in an
      army that would be able to meet and drive back the white people, who were continually advancing on the Indian
      tribes and forcing them from their lands toward the Rocky mountains; that Tecumseh was a great general, and that
      nothing but his premature death defeated his grand plan. (<i><a href="#Catlin">Catlin</a>, 2.</i>)</p>

  <div class="subhead">
    <p>My father, the Great Spirit holds all the world in his hands. I pray to him that we may not be removed from our
      lands.... Take pity on us and let us remain where we are.—<i>Känakûk.</i></p>

    <p>I was singularly struck with the noble efforts of this champion of the mere remnant of a poisoned race, so
      strenuously laboring to rescue the remainder of his people from the deadly bane that has been brought amongst them
      by enlightened Christians.—<i><a href="#Catlin">Catlin</a>.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The scene now shifts to the west of the Mississippi. With the death of Tecumtha the confederacy of the northwestern
    tribes fell to pieces, and on the closing of the war of 1812 the government inaugurated a series of treaties
    resulting, within twenty years, in the removal of almost every tribe beyond the Mississippi and the appropriation of
    their former country by the whites. Among others the Kickapoo, by the treaty of Edwardsville in 1819, had ceded the
    whole of their ancient territory in Illinois, comprising nearly one-half the area of the state, in exchange for a
    much smaller tract on Osage river in Missouri and $3,000 in goods. (<i><a href="#Treaties">Treaties</a>, 1.</i>) The government also agreed
    to furnish two boats to take them up the river to their new home, where “the United States promise to guarantee to
    the said tribe the peaceable possession of the tract of land hereby ceded to them, and to restrain and prevent all
    white persons from hunting, settling, or otherwise intruding upon it.”</p>

  <p>For some reason, however, the Kickapoo manifested no overwhelming desire to remove from their villages and
    cornfields on the broad prairies of Illinois to the rugged hills of Missouri. This may have been due to the innate
    perversity of the savage, or possibly to the fact that the new country guaranteed to them was already occupied by
    their hereditary enemies, the Osage, who outnumbered the Kickapoo three to one. To be sure, these aboriginal
    proprietors had agreed to surrender the territory to the United States, but they were still at home to all visitors,
    as the immigrant Cherokee had learned to their cost. Be that as it may, several years passed and it began to be
    suspected that the Kickapoo were not anxious to go west and grow up with the country. Investigation disclosed the
    fact that, instead of removing to the reservation on Osage river, one-half of the tribe had gone southward in a body
    and crossed over to the Spanish side of Red river (now Texas), where they might reasonably hope to be secure from
    the further advance of the Americans. Others were preparing to follow, and the government<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_693">693</span> agents were instructed to make a strong effort to effect the immediate removal of
    the tribe to Missouri and to prevent the emigration of any more to the south.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 60</span>—Känakûk the Kickapoo prophet.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>It now appeared that they were encouraged to hold their ground by a new prophet who had sprung up among them, named
    Känakûk. The name (also spelled Kee-an-ne-kuk and Kanacuk), refers to putting the foot upon a fallen object, and
    does not denote “the foremost man,” as rendered by Catlin. In a letter written to General Clark, in February, 1827—a
    few days after the prophet himself had visited General Clark—the agent, Mr Graham, after reporting his failure to
    induce the tribe to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_694">694</span> remove, states that the prophet “had no idea
    of giving up his lands,” and continues:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This man has acquired an influence over his people through supposed revelations from God, which he urges on them
      with an eloquence, mildness, and firmness of manner that carries to their credulous ears conviction of his
      communications with God.</p>

    <p>To give a favorable turn to his mind, I apparently gave credence to his statements of these revelations, and
      attempted to put a construction on them for him. He listened to me with great attention, and, after I had
      finished, said I might be right; that God would talk to him again and he would let me know what he said. In the
      meantime he would use his influence to get his people to move, but that he could not himself come over until all
      had removed; that there were many bad men yet among them, whom he hoped to convert to the ways of God, and then
      all would come over. He would preach to his men and warn them from taking away or injuring the property of the
      white people, and if any white man struck them—to use his own expression—he would bow his head and not complain;
      he would stop any attempt to take revenge. He seems to have a wonderful influence over those Indians who
      accompanied him. They neither drank nor painted, were serious, though not gloomy. (<i><a href="#Ind_Off">Ind. Off.</a>, 1.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 61</span>—Känakûk’s heaven.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In the same month Känakûk himself visited General Clark at Saint Louis, and in the course of a long talk explained
    the origin of his divine mission and the nature of his doctrine, illustrating the subject by means of a peculiar
    diagram (<a href="#fig_61">figure 61</a>), and closing with an earnest appeal in behalf of his people that they should be allowed to
    remain undisturbed. Although it was said by the traders that he had stolen his inspiration from a Methodist
    preacher, it is plain from an examination of his doctrine that he was the direct spiritual successor of Tenskwatawa
    and the Delaware prophet, who in their generation had preached to the same tribe. Like his predecessors, also, he
    condemned the use of “medicine bags” and medicine songs, which, although universal among the tribes, seem to have
    been regarded by the better class of Indians as witchcraft was in former days among the whites.</p>

  <p>After the usual preliminary expressions of mutual friendship and good will, Känakûk stated that all his people were
    united in sentiment, and then proceeded to explain his religious views as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>My father, the Great Spirit has placed us all on this earth; he has given to our nation a piece of land. Why do
      you want to take it away and give us so much trouble? We ought to live in peace and happiness among ourselves and
      with you. We have heard of some trouble about our land. I have come down to see you and have all explained.</p>

    <div class="center">*<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span></div>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_695">695</span></p>

    <p>My father, the Great Spirit appeared to me; he saw my heart was in sorrow about our land; he told me not to give
      up the business, but go to my Great Father and he would listen to me. My father, when I talked to the Great
      Spirit, I saw the chiefs holding the land fast. He told me the life of our children was short and that the earth
      would sink.</p>

    <p>My father, I will explain to you what the Great Spirit said to me—to do so, I must make some marks. The Great
      Spirit says: My father, we started from this point (A, <a href="#fig_61">figure 61</a>). We are here now (B). When we get here (C), the
      Great Spirit will appear to me again. Here (B) the Great Spirit gave his blessings to the Indians and told them to
      tell his people to throw away their medicine bags and not to steal, not to tell lies, not to murder, not to
      quarrel, and to burn their medicine bags. If they did not, they could not get on the straight way, but would have
      to go the crooked path of the bad here (D); that when we got to this place (the curved line, E), we would not be
      able to cross it unless we were all good. It was fire. That we should go to this place (E), where there would be
      collected all the red chiefs and there would be a great preaching. That if we had not thrown away all our bad
      doings, these two points would meet (D and E), and then the Great Spirit would destroy everything and the world
      would be turned over. That if we would be good and throw away all our bad doings, we would cross this fire, when
      we would [come] to water (second line), which we would cross. There we would come to a country where there was
      nothing but a prairie and nothing grew upon it. There the sun would be hid from us by four black clouds. When we
      get here (C), the Great Spirit will explain these round marks.</p>

    <p>My father, I have now explained as well as I can, with much pains, our situation. I wish you to tell me the truth
      and hide nothing from me. I have heard that some of your warriors are going to take up the tomahawk. I explained
      to you last fall our situation. We are now here (B), where we are in great trouble. I told you of all our
      troubles. I asked you to reflect on our situation and that we would come back to see you.</p>

    <div class="center">*<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span></div>
    <p>My father, you call all the redskins your children. When we have children, we treat them well. That is the reason
      I make this long talk to get you to take pity on us and let us remain where we are.</p>

    <p>My father, I wish after my talk is over you would write to my Great Father, the president, that we have a desire
      to remain a little longer where we now are. I have explained to you that we have thrown all our badness away and
      keep the good path. I wish our Great Father could hear that. I will now talk to my Great Father, the president.<p>

    <p>My Great Father, I don’t know if you are the right chief, because I have heard some things go wrong. I wish you
      to reflect on our situation and let me know. I want to talk to you mildly and in peace, so that we may understand
      each other. When I saw the Great Spirit, he told me to throw all our bad acts away. We did so. Some of our chiefs
      said the land belonged to us, the Kickapoos; but this is not what the Great Spirit told me—the lands belong to
      him. The Great Spirit told me that no people owned the lands—that all was his, and not to forget to tell the white
      people that when we went into council. When I saw the Great Spirit, he told me, Mention all this to your Great
      Father. He will take pity on your situation and let you remain on the lands where you are for some years, when you
      will be able to get through all the bad places (the marks in the figure), and where you will get to a clear piece
      of land where you will all live happy. When I talked to the Great Spirit, he told me to make my warriors throw
      their tomahawks in the bad place. I did so, and every night and morning I raise my hands to the Great Spirit and
      pray to him to give us success. I expect, my father, that God has put me in a good way—that our children shall see
      their sisters and brothers and our women see their children. They will grow up and travel and see their totems.
      The Great Spirit told me, “Our old men had totems. They were good and had many totems. Now you have scarcely <span
      class="pagenum" id="Page_696">696</span>any. If you follow my advice, you will soon have totems again.” Say
      this to my Great Father for me.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

    <p>My father, since I talked with the Great Spirit, our women and children and ourselves, we have not such good
      clothes, but we don’t mind that. We think of praying every day to the Great Spirit to get us safe to the good
      lands, where all will be peace and happiness.</p>

    <p>My father, the Great Spirit holds all the world in his hands. I pray to him that we may not be removed from our
      land until we can see and talk to all our totems....</p>

    <p>My father, when I left my women and children, they told me, “As you are going to see our Great Father, tell him
      to let us alone and let us eat our victuals with a good heart.”</p>

    <div class="center">*<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span></div>

    <p>My father, since my talk with the Great Spirit we have nothing cooked until the middle of the day. The children
      get nothing in the morning to eat. We collect them all to pray to the Great Spirit to make our hearts pure, and
      then eat. We bring our children up to be good.</p>

    <p>My father, I will tell you all I know. I will put nothing on my back. God told me, Whenever you make a talk, tell
      everything true. Keep nothing behind, and then you will find everything go right.</p>

    <div class="center">*<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span></div>

    <p>My father, when I talked with the Great Spirit, he did not tell me to sell my lands, because I did not know how
      much was a dollar’s worth, or the game that run on it. If he told me so, I would tell you to-day.</p>

    <p>My father, you have heard what I have said. I have represented to you our situation, and ask you to take pity on
      us and let us remain where we are....</p>

    <p>My father, I have shown you in the lines I have made the bad places. Our warriors even are afraid of those dark
      places you see there. That is the reason they threw their tomahawks aside and put up their hands to the Great
      Spirit.</p>

    <p>My father, every time we eat we raise our hands to the Great Spirit to give us success.</p>

    <p>My father, we are sitting by each other here to tell the truth. If you write anything wrong, the Great Spirit
      will know it. If I say anything not true, the Great Spirit will hear it.</p>

    <p>My father, you know how to write and can take down what is said for your satisfaction. I can not; all I do is
      through the Great Spirit for the benefit of my women and children.</p>

    <p>My father, everything belongs to the Great Spirit. If he chooses to make the earth shake, or turn it over, all
      the skins, white and red, can not stop it. I have done. I trust to the Great Spirit. (<i><a href="#Ind_Off">Ind. Off.</a>, 2.</i>)</p>

  <p>A few years later, in 1831, Catlin visited Känakûk, who was still living with the remnant of his people in
    Illinois, and was then regarded as their chief. He still preached the same doctrine, which the artist incorrectly
    supposed was the Christian religion—probably from the fact that the meetings were held on Sunday in imitation of the
    whites—and especially was constantly and earnestly exhorting his tribesmen to cease from drinking whisky, which
    threatened to destroy their race. His influence had extended into Michigan, and many of the Potawatomi <span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_697">697</span>were counted among his disciples. Catlin, who painted his portrait
    (of which <a href="#fig_60">figure 60</a> is a reproduction), heard him preach, and expressed surprise and admiration at the ease and
    grace of his manner and his evident eloquent command of language. The traveler continues:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I was singularly struck with the noble efforts of this champion of the mere remnant of a poisoned race so
      strenuously laboring to rescue the remainder of his people from the deadly bane that has been brought amongst them
      by enlightened Christians. How far the efforts of this zealous man have succeeded in Christianizing, I can not
      tell, but it is quite certain that his exemplary and constant endeavors have completely abolished the practice of
      drinking whisky in his tribe, which alone is a very praiseworthy achievement, and the first and indispensable step
      toward all other improvements. I was some time amongst those people, and was exceedingly pleased and surprised
      also to witness their sobriety and their peaceable conduct, not having seen an instance of drunkenness, or seen or
      heard of any use made of spirituous liquors whilst I was amongst the tribe. (<i><a href="#Catlin">Catlin</a>, 3.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After mentioning, although apparently not crediting the assertion of the traders, that the prophet had borrowed his
    doctrines from a white man, Catlin goes on to describe a peculiar prayer-stick which Känakûk had given to his
    followers, and which reminds us at once of the similar device of the Delaware prophet of 1764, and is in line with
    the whole system of birchbark pictographs among the northern tribes. These sticks were of maple, graven with
    hieroglyphic prayers and other religious symbols. They were carved by the prophet himself, who distributed them to
    every family in the tribe, deriving quite a revenue from their sale, and in this way increasing his influence both
    as a priest and as a man of property. Apparently every man, woman, and child in the tribe was at this time in the
    habit of reciting the prayers from these sticks on rising in the morning and before retiring for the night. This was
    done by placing the right index finger first under the upper character while repeating a short prayer which it
    suggested, then under the next, and the next, and so on to the bottom, the whole prayer, which was sung as a sort of
    chant, occupying about ten minutes.</p>

  <p>Without undertaking to pass judgement on the purity of the prophet’s motives, Catlin strongly asserts that his
    influence and example were good and had effectually turned his people from vice and dissipation to temperance and
    industry, notwithstanding the debasing tendency of association with a frontier white population.</p>

  <p>The veteran missionary, Allis, also notes the use of this prayer stick as he observed it in 1834 among the
    Kickapoo, then living near Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas. The prophet’s followers were accustomed to meet for worship
    on Sunday, when Känakûk delivered an exhortation in their own language, after which they formed in line and marched
    around several times in single file, reciting the chant from their prayer-sticks and shaking hands with the
    bystanders as they passed. As they departed they continued to chant until they arrived at the “father’s house” or
    heaven, indicated by the figure of a horn at the top of the prayer-stick. The worshipers met also on Fridays and
    made confession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_698">698</span> of their sins, after which certain persons
    appointed for the purpose gave each penitent several strokes with a rod of hickory, according to the gravity of his
    offense. (<i><a href="#Allis">Allis</a>, 1.</i>)</p>

  <p>Through the kindness of Mr C. H. Bartlett, of South Bend, Indiana, the United States National Museum has recently
    come into possession of one of these prayer-sticks. The stick, of which <a href="#plate_lxxxvi">plate <span class="smcap">lxxxvi</span></a>
    gives a good idea, is of maple, a little more than 12 inches in length, 2&#x200B;9⁄16 inches in its greatest width, and
    three-eighths of an inch thick. It is said to have been painted a bright red on one side and a vivid green on the
    other. The paint has now disappeared, however, leaving bare <span class="pagenum" id="Page_699">699</span>the
    surface of the wood, polished from long use. One side is carved with the symbolic figures already mentioned, while
    the other is smooth. In all its details it is a neat specimen of Indian workmanship. According to the tradition of
    the Armstrong family, its former owners, the small square in the lower left-hand corner represents hell or the final
    abode of the wicked, while the house with the four pine (?) trees, at the top, symbolizes the spiritual home of the
    devout followers of the prophet. As is well known, four is the sacred number of many Indian tribes. The significance
    of several other lines above and below is unknown. Along the shaft of the stick from bottom to top are the prayer
    characters, arranged in three groups of five each, one group being near the bottom, while the others are along the
    upper portion of the shaft and are separated one from the other by a small circle. The characters bear some
    resemblance to the old black-letter type of a missal, while the peculiar arrangement is strongly suggestive of the
    Catholic rosary with its fifteen “mysteries” in three groups of five each. It will be remembered that the earliest
    and most constant missionaries among the Kickapoo and other lake tribes were Catholic, and we may readily see that
    their teachings and ceremonies influenced this native religion, as was afterward the case with the religions of
    Smohalla and the Ghost dance. Neither three nor five are commonly known as sacred numbers among the Indians, while
    three is distinctly Christian in its symbolism. It is perhaps superfluous to state that the ideas of heaven and hell
    are not aboriginal, but were among the first incorporated from the teachings of the white missionaries. The
    characters resembling letters may be from the alphabetic system of sixteen characters which it is said the Ojibwa
    invented for recording their own language, and taught to the Kickapoo and Sauk, and which resembled somewhat the
    letters of the Roman alphabet, from which they apparently were derived. (<i><a href="#Hamilton">Hamilton</a>, 1.</i>)</p>

    <figcaption class="xsmall">THE PRAYER-STICK</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>This prayer-stick or “bible,” as it has been called, was obtained by Mr Bartlett from Mr R.V. Armstrong, of Mill
    Creek, Indiana, who stated that it was the only remaining one of a large number which had been in possession of the
    family for many years. The story of the manner in which it was originally obtained, as told by Mr Armstrong, is
    interesting. “His father, Reverend James Armstrong, was a Methodist minister and missionary who had been sent to
    northern Indiana in the early part of this century. In 1830, while living on Shawnee prairie, 3 miles from the
    present site of Attica, Indiana, a large band of Kickapoo Indians came to his house to visit the missionary, and
    apparently regarded the interview as of great importance to themselves. They declared that they were from beyond the
    Mississippi river, that they had heard of Mr Armstrong and his missionary labors, and that they believed him to be
    the one for whom their people had long been looking. Each Indian held in his hand one of these wooden crosses, and
    as they knelt on the grass in front of the missionary’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_700">700</span> house,
    they went through their devotions in their own tongue, moving their fingers over the inscription that ascends the
    shaft of the cross. The missionary understood them to state that this cross was their “bible,” that they knew that
    it was not the true bible, but that they had been told to use it until one should come who would give them in
    exchange the genuine word of God. Thereupon the missionary gathered up their crosses—and there were more than a
    large basketful of them—and gave in exchange to each a copy of the New Testament. The Indians received the books
    with profuse expressions of gratitude and apparently viewed them at once as sacred possessions. These wise men from
    the west then went away to their far country.”</p>

  <p>Känakûk died of smallpox in 1852, in Kansas, where his people had been removed in spite of his eloquent appeals in
    their behalf. For many years he had been recognized as the chief of his tribe, and as such exerted a most beneficial
    influence over the Kickapoo in restraining the introduction and use of liquor among them. At the same time he
    staunchly upheld the old Indian idea and resisted every advance of the missionaries and civilization to the last. He
    was regarded as possessed of supernatural powers, and in his last illness asserted that he would arise again three
    days after death. In expectation of the fulfillment of the prophecy, a number of his followers remained watching
    near the corpse until they too contracted the contagion and died likewise. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 1.</i>) After his death, the
    decline of his tribe was rapid and without check. In 1894 there remained only 514, about equally divided between
    Kansas and Oklahoma. These few survivors of a large tribe still hold in loving reverence the name of their chief and
    prophet.</p>

  <h3 id="PA_THESKE">PA′THĔSKĔ</h3>

  <p>Recent personal investigation among the Winnebago failed to develop any knowledge of a former doctrine of an
    approaching destruction of the world, as mentioned in a statement already quoted (see <a href="#Page_661">page 661</a>). It appeared,
    however, that at the time indicated, about 1852 or 1853, while the tribe was still living on Turkey river, Iowa, a
    prophet known as Pa′thĕskĕ, or Long Nose, announced that he had been instructed in a vision to teach his people a
    new dance, which he called the friendship dance (chû′‘korăki′). This they were to perform at intervals for one whole
    year, at the end of which time, in the spring, they must take the warpath against their hereditary enemy, the Sioux,
    and would then reap a rich harvest of scalps. The dance, as he taught it to them, he claimed to have seen performed
    by a band of spirits in the other world, whither he had been taken after a ceremonial fast of several days’
    duration. It differed from their other dances, and, although warlike in its ultimate purpose, was not a war dance.
    It was performed by the men alone, circling around a fire within the lodge. He also designated a young man named
    Sara′minûka, or “Indistinct,” as the proper one to lead the expedition at the appointed time.<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_701">701</span> The friendship dance went on all through the summer and winter until spring, when
    the prophet announced that he had received a new revelation forbidding the proposed expedition. His disgusted
    followers at once denounced him as an impostor and abandoned the dance. Sara′minûka was soon afterward killed by an
    accident, which was considered by the Indians a direct retribution for his failure to carry out his part of the
    program. The prophet died a few years later while on a visit to Washington with a delegation of his tribe.</p>

  <p>Although the old men consulted on the subject seemed to know nothing of any predicted destruction of the world in
    this connection, it is probable that the statement given by Agent Fletcher at the time was correct, as such cycle
    myths are very general among the Indian and other primitive tribes. The Arapaho informed the author that we are now
    living in the sixth cycle, and that the final catastrophe will take place at the close of the seventh.</p>

  <h3 id="Ta_vibo">TÄ′VIBO</h3>

  <p>About 1870 another prophet arose among the Paiute in Nevada. As most Indian movements are unknown to the whites at
    their inception, the date is variously put from 1869 to 1872. He is said to have been the father of the present
    “messiah,” who has unquestionably derived many of his ideas from him, and lived, as does his son, in Mason valley,
    about 60 miles south of Virginia City, not far from Walker River reservation. In talking with his son, he said that
    his father’s name was Tä′vibo or “White man,” and that he was a <i>capita</i> (Spanish, <i>capitan</i>) or petty
    chief, but not a prophet or preacher, although he used to have visions and was invulnerable. From concurrent
    testimony of Indians and white men, however, there seems to be no doubt that he did preach and prophesy and
    introduce a new religious dance among his people, and that the doctrine which he promulgated and the hopes which he
    held out twenty years ago were the foundation on which his son has built the structure of the present messiah
    religion. He was visited by Indians from Oregon and Idaho, and his teachings made their influence felt among the
    Bannock and Shoshoni, as well as among all the scattered bands of the Paiute, to whom he continued to preach until
    his death a year or two later. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 1 and 2; <a href="#AGO">A. G. O.</a>, 1; <a href="#Phister">Phister</a>, 1.</i>)</p>

  <p>Captain J. M. Lee, Ninth infantry, formerly on the staff of General Miles, was on duty in that neighborhood at the
    time and gives the following account of the prophet and his doctrines in a personal letter to the author:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I was on Indian duty in Nevada in 1869, 1870, and 1871. When visiting Walker Lake reservation in 1869–70, I
      became acquainted with several superstitious beliefs then prevailing among the Paiute Indians. It was a rough,
      mountainous region roundabout, and mysterious happenings, according to tradition, always occurred when the prophet
      or medicine-men went up into the mountains and there received their revelations from the divine spirits. In the
      earlier part of the sixties the whites <span class="pagenum" id="Page_702">702</span>began to come in and
      appropriate much of the Indian country in Nevada, and in the usual course it turned out that the medicine-men or
      prophets were looked to for relief. The most influential went up alone into the mountain and there met the Great
      Spirit. He brought back with him no tablets of stone, but he was a messenger of good tidings to the effect that
      within a few moons there was to be a great upheaval or earthquake. All the improvements of the whites—all their
      houses, their goods, stores, etc.—would remain, but the whites would be swallowed up, while the Indians would be
      saved and permitted to enjoy the earth and all the fullness thereof, including anything left by the wicked whites.
      This revelation was duly proclaimed by the prophet, and attracted a few believers, but the doubting skeptics were
      too many, and they ridiculed the idea that the white men would fall into the holes and be swallowed up while the
      Indians would not. As the prophet could not enforce his belief, he went up into the mountain again and came back
      with a second revelation, which was that when the great disaster came, all, both Indians and whites, would be
      swallowed up or overwhelmed, but that at the end of three days (or a few days) the Indians would be resurrected in
      the flesh, and would live forever to enjoy the earth, with plenty of game, fish, and pine nuts, while their
      enemies, the whites, would be destroyed forever. There would thus be a final and eternal separation between
      Indians and whites.</p>

    <p>This revelation, which seemed more reasonable, was rather popular for awhile, but as time wore along faith seemed
      to weaken and the prophet was without honor even in his own country. After much fasting and prayer, he made a
      third trip to the mountain, where he secured a final revelation or message to the people. The divine spirit had
      become so much incensed at the lack of faith in the prophecies, that it was revealed to his chosen one that those
      Indians who believed in the prophecy would be resurrected and be happy, but those who did not believe in it would
      stay in the ground and be damned forever with the whites.</p>

    <p>It was not long after this that the prophet died, and the poor miserable Indians worried along for nearly two
      decades, eating grasshoppers, lizards, and fish, and trying to be civilized until the appearance of this new
      prophet Quoit-tsow, who is said to be the son, either actual or spiritual, of the first one.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Additional details are given in the following interesting extract from a letter addressed to the Commissioner of
    Indian Affairs, under date of November 19, 1890, by Mr Frank Campbell, who has an intimate acquaintance with the
    tribe and was employed in an official capacity on the reservation at the time when Tävibo first announced the new
    revelation. It would appear from Mr Campbell’s statement that under the new dispensation both races were to meet on
    a common level, and, as this agrees with what Professor Thompson, referred to later on, afterward found among the
    eastern Paiute, it is probable that the original doctrine had been very considerably modified since its first
    promulgation a few years before.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Eighteen years ago I was resident farmer on Walker Lake Indian reserve, Nevada. I had previously been connected
      with the Indian service at the reserve for ten years, was familiar with the Paiute customs, and personally
      acquainted with all the Indians in that region. In 1872 an Indian commenced preaching a new religion at that
      reserve that caused a profound sensation among the Paiute. For several months I was kept in ignorance of the cause
      of the excitement—which was remarkable, considering the confidence they had always reposed in me. They no doubt
      expected me to ridicule the sayings of the new messiah, as I had always labored among them to break down, their
      superstitious beliefs. When finally I was made <span class="pagenum" id="Page_703">703</span>acquainted with,
      the true facts of the case, I told them, the preachings of Waugh-zee-waugh-ber were good and no harm could come
      from it. Indian emissaries visited the reserve from Idaho, Oregon, and other places, to investigate the new
      religion. I visited the Indian camp while the prophet was in a trance and remained until he came to. In accordance
      with instructions, the Indians gathered around him and joined in a song that was to guide the spirit back to the
      body. Upon reanimation he gave a long account of his visit in the spirit to the Supreme Ruler, who was then on the
      way with all the spirits of the departed dead to again reside upon this earth and change it into a paradise. Life
      was to be eternal, and no distinction was to exist between races.</p>

    <p>This morning’s press dispatches contain an account of Porcupine’s visit to Walker lake ... that proves to me that
      the religion started at Walker lake eighteen years ago is the same that is now agitating the Indian world. There
      is nothing in it to cause trouble between whites and Indians unless the new Messiah is misquoted and his doctrine
      misconstrued. I left Walker Lake reserve in June, 1873, and at the time supposed this craze would die out, but
      have several times since been reminded by Nevada papers and letters that it was gradually spreading. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 3.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The name given by Campbell certainly does not much resemble Tävibo, but it is quite possible that the father, like
    the son, had more than one name. It is also possible that “Waughzeewaughber” was not the prophet described by
    Captain Lee, but one of his disciples who had taken up and modified the original doctrine. The name Tävibo refers to
    the east (<i>tävänagwat</i>) or place where the sun (<i>täbi</i>) rises. By the cognate Shoshoni and Comanche the
    whites are called <i>Taivo</i>.</p>

  <p>From oral information of Professor A. H. Thompson, of the United States Geological Survey, I learn some particulars
    of the advent of the new doctrine among the Paiute of southwestern Utah. While his party was engaged in that section
    in the spring of 1875, a great excitement was caused among the Indians by the report that two mysterious beings with
    white skins (it will be remembered that the father of Wovoka was named Tävibo or “white man”) had appeared among the
    Paiute far to the west and announced a speedy resurrection of all the dead Indians, the restoration of the game, and
    the return of the old-time primitive life. Under the new order of things, moreover, both races alike were to be
    white. A number of Indians from Utah went over into Nevada, where they met others who claimed to have seen these
    mysterious visitors farther in the west. On their return to Utah they brought back with them the ceremonial of the
    new belief, the chief part of the ritual being a dance performed at night in a circle, with no fire in the center,
    very much as in the modern Ghost dance.</p>

  <p>It is said that the Mormons, who hold the theory that the Indians are the descendants of the supposititious “ten
    lost tribes,” cherish, as a part of their faith, the tradition that some of the lost Hebrew emigrants are still
    ice-bound in the frozen north, whence they will one day emerge to rejoin their brethren in the south. When the news
    of this Indian revelation came to their ears, the Mormon priests accepted it as a prophecy of speedy fulfillment of
    their own traditions, and Orson Pratt, one of the most prominent leaders, preached a sermon, which was
    extensively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_704">704</span> copied and commented on at the time, urging the
    faithful to arrange their affairs and put their houses in order to receive the long-awaited wanderers.</p>

  <p>According to the statement of the agent then in charge at Fort Hall, in Idaho, the Mormons at the same time—the
    early spring of 1875—sent emissaries to the Bannock, urging them to go to Salt Lake City to be baptized into the
    Mormon religion. A large number accepted the invitation without the knowledge of the agent, went down to Utah, and
    were there baptized, and then returned to work as missionaries of the new faith among their tribes. As an additional
    inducement, free rations were furnished by the Mormons to all who would come and be baptized, and “they were told
    that by being baptized and going to church the old men would all become young, the young men would never be sick,
    that the Lord had a work for them to do, and that they were the chosen people of God to establish his kingdom upon
    the earth,” etc. It is also asserted that they were encouraged to resist the authority of the government. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>,
    2.</i>) However much of truth there may be in these reports, and we must make considerable allowance for local
    prejudice, it is sufficiently evident that the Mormons took an active interest in the religious ferment then
    existing among the neighboring tribes and helped to give shape to the doctrine which crystallized some years later
    in the Ghost dance.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Various other prophets of more or less local celebrity have arisen from time to time among the tribes, and the
    resurrection of the dead and the return of the olden things have usually figured prominently in their prophecies. In
    fact, this idea has probably been the day-dream of every Indian medicine-man since the whites first landed in
    America. Most of these, however, have been unknown to fame outside of their own narrow circles, except where chance
    or deliberate purpose has given a warlike meaning to their teachings and thus made them the subjects of official
    notice.</p>

  <p>Among these may be mentioned the Apache medicine-man Nakai′-doklĭ′ni, who attracted some attention for a time in
    southern Arizona in 1881. (<i><a href="#Bourke">Bourke</a>, 1.</i>) In the early part of this year he began to advertise his supernatural
    powers, claiming to be able to raise the dead and commune with spirits, and predicting that the whites would soon be
    driven from the land. He taught his followers a new and peculiar dance, in which the performers were ranged like the
    spokes of a wheel, all facing inward, while he, standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_705">705</span> in the
    center, sprinkled them with the sacred <i>hoddentin</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5"
    class="fnanchor">[3]</a> as they circled around him.</p>

  <p>In June of 1881 he announced to his people, the White Mountain band of Apache on San Carlos reservation, that on
    condition of receiving a sufficient number of horses and blankets for his trouble he would bring back from the dead
    two chiefs who had been killed a few months before. The proposition naturally aroused great excitement among the
    Indians. Eager to have once more with them their beloved chiefs, they willingly produced the required ponies, and
    when remonstrated with by the agent, replied that they would wait until the specified time for the fulfillment of
    the prediction, when, if the dead chiefs failed to materialize, they would demand the restoration of the property.
    (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 3.</i>)</p>

  <p>Accordingly Nakai′-doklĭ′ni began his prayers and ceremonies, and the dance was kept up regularly at his camp on
    Cibicu creek until August, when it was reported to Colonel E. A. Carr; commanding at Fort Apache, that the
    medicine-man had announced that the dead chiefs refused to return because of the presence of the whites, but that
    when the whites left, the dead would return, and that the whites would be out of the country when the corn was ripe.</p>

  <p>As matters seemed to be getting serious, the agent now called on the commanding officer to “arrest or kill him, or
    both.” The officer prepared to make the arrest when Nakai′-doklĭ′ni should come down to the post to lead the dance
    which had been arranged to take place in a few days. The prophet failed to put in an appearance, however, and
    messengers were sent to his camp to ask him to come to the fort the next Sunday. To this message he returned an
    evasive reply, whereon Colonel Carr, with 85 white troops and 23 Apache scouts, started for his camp in Cibicu
    canyon to put him under arrest. They arrived at the village on August 30. Nakai′-doklĭ′ni submitted quietly to
    arrest, but as the troops were making camp for the night, their own scouts, joined by others of the Indians, opened
    fire on them. A sharp skirmish ensued, in which several soldiers were killed or wounded, but the Indians were
    repulsed with considerable loss, including the prophet himself, who was killed at the first fire. The result was
    another in the long series of Apache outbreaks. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 4; <a href="#War">Sec. War</a>, 1; <a href="#AGO">A. G. O.</a>, 2.</i>)</p>

  <h3 id="Potawatomi">THE POTAWATOMI PROPHET</h3>

  <p>In 1883 a new religion was introduced among the Potawatomi and Kickapoo, of the Pottawotomie and Great Nemaha
    agency in northeastern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_706">706</span> Kansas, by visiting Potawatomi, Winnebago,
    and Ojibwa from Wisconsin. As usual, the ritual part consists chiefly of a ceremonial dance. In doctrine it teaches
    the same code of morality enjoined by the ten commandments, and especially prohibits liquor drinking, gambling, and
    horse racing, for which, reason the agents generally have not seen fit to interfere with it, and in some cases have
    rather encouraged it as a civilizing influence among that portion of the tribes not yet enrolled in Christian
    denominations. The movement is entirely distinct from the Ghost dance, and may perhaps be a revival of the system
    preached by Känakûk more than fifty years before. In 1891 the majority of the two tribes, numbering in all 749, were
    reported as adherents of the doctrine. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 5, 6, 7; also reports from the same agency for 1887 and 1889.</i>)
    A large number of the Sauk and Fox, Kickapoo, and Potawatomi of Oklahoma are also believers in the religion.</p>

  <p>In 1885 Agent Patrick says on this subject:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>These Indians are chaste, cleanly, and industrious, and would be a valuable acquisition to the Prairie band if it
      were not for their intense devotion to a religious dance started among the northern Indians some years since. This
      dance was introduced to the Prairie band about two years ago by the Absentee Pottawatomies and Winnebagoes, and
      has spread throughout the tribes in the agency. They seem to have adopted the religion as a means of expressing
      their belief in the justice and mercy of the Great Spirit and of their devotion to him, and are so earnest in
      their convictions as to its affording them eternal happiness that I have thought it impolitic so far to interfere
      with it any further than to advise as few meetings as possible and to discountenance it in my intercourse with the
      individuals practicing the religion. It is not an unmixed evil, as under its teaching drunkenness and gambling
      have been reduced 75 per cent, and a departure from virtue on the part of its members meets with the severest
      condemnation. As some tenets of revealed religion are embraced in its doctrines, I do not consider it a backward
      step for the Indians who have not heretofore professed belief in any Christian religion, and believe its worst
      features are summed up in the loss of time it occasions and the fanatical train of thought involved in the
      constant contemplation of the subject. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 6.</i>)</p>

  <h3 id="Cheez_tah_paezh">CHEEZ-TAH-PAEZH THE SWORD-BEARER</h3>

  <p>It is probable that something of the messiah idea entered into the promises held out to his followers by
    Sword-bearer, a Crow medicine-man, in Montana in 1887. The official records are silent on this point, although it is
    definitely stated that he asserted his own invulnerability, and that his claims in this respect were implicitly
    believed by his people. Cheez-tah-paezh, literally “Wraps his tail” (also written Cheeschapahdisch, Cheschopah,
    Chese-cha-pahdish, and Chese-Topah), was without any special prominence in his tribe until the summer of 1887, when,
    in company with several other young men of the Crows, he participated in the sun dance of the Cheyenne, and showed
    such fortitude in enduring the dreadful torture that he was presented by the Cheyenne with a medicine saber painted
    red, in virtue of which he took the title of Sword-bearer. This naturally brought him into notice at home, and he
    soon aspired to become a chief and medicine-man. Among other things, he asserted that no bullet or weapon had power
    to harm him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_707">707</span> What other claims he made are not known, but his
    words produced such an impression, it is said, that for a time every full-blood and half-blood among the Crows
    believed in him.</p>

  <p>In a few months he had become one of the most influential leaders in the tribe, when, taking advantage of some
    dissatisfaction toward the agent, he headed a demonstration against the agency on September 30. Troops under General
    Ruger were called on to arrest him and the others concerned, and in attempting to do this, on November 5, 1887, a
    skirmish ensued in which Sword-bearer was killed. His death convinced his followers of the falsehood of his
    pretensions, and the tribe, which hitherto had always been loyal to the government, soon resumed its friendly
    attitude. (<i><a href="#War">Sec. War</a>, 2; <a href="#AGO">A. G. O.</a>, 3; additional details from a personal letter by Colonel Simon Snyder, Fifteenth
    infantry.</i>)</p>

  <p>The action is graphically described by Roosevelt on the authority of one of the officers engaged. When the troops
    arrived, they found the Crow warriors awaiting them on a hill, mounted on their war ponies and in full paint and
    buckskin. In this author’s words—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Crows on the hilltop showed a sullen and threatening front, and the troops advanced slowly toward them, and
      then halted for a parley. Meanwhile a mass of black thunder clouds gathering on the horizon threatened one of
      those cloudbursts of extreme severity and suddenness so characteristic of the plains country. While still trying
      to make arrangements for a parley, a horseman started out of the Crow ranks and galloped headlong down toward the
      troops. It was the medicine chief Sword-bearer. He was painted and in his battle dress, wearing his war bonnet of
      floating, trailing eagle feathers, and with the plumes of the same bird braided in the mane and tail of his fiery
      little horse. On he came at a gallop almost up to the troops, and then began to circle around them, calling and
      singing, and throwing his red sword into the air, catching it by the hilt as it fell. Twice he rode completely
      around the troops, who stood in uncertainty, not knowing what to make of his performance, and expressly forbidden
      to shoot at him. Then, paying no further heed to them, he rode back toward the Crows. It appears that he had told
      the latter that he would ride twice around the hostile force, and by his incantations would call down rain from
      heaven, which would make the hearts of the white men like water, so that they would go back to their homes. Sure
      enough, while the arrangements for the parley were still going forward, down came the cloudburst, drenching the
      command, and making the ground on the hills in front nearly impassable; and before it dried a courier arrived with
      orders to the troops to go back to camp.</p>

    <p>This fulfillment of Sword-bearer’s prophecy of course raised his reputation to the zenith, and the young men of
      the tribe prepared for war, while the older chiefs, who more fully realized the power of the whites, still hung
      back. When the troops next appeared, they came upon the entire Crow force, the women and children with their
      tepees being off to one side beyond a little stream, while almost all the warriors of the tribe were gathered in
      front. Sword-bearer started to repeat his former ride, to the intense irritation of the soldiers. Luckily,
      however, this time some of his young men could not be restrained. They, too, began to ride near the troops, and
      one of them was unable to refrain from firing on Captain Edwards’s troop, which was in the van. This gave the
      soldiers their chance. They instantly responded with a volley, and Edwards’s troop charged. The fight lasted only
      a minute or two, for Sword-bearer was struck by a bullet and fell; and as he had boasted himself invulnerable and
      promised that his warriors should be invulnerable also if they would follow him, the hearts of the latter became
      as water, and they broke in every direction. (<i>Roosevelt, 1.</i>)</p>

      THE SMOHALLA RELIGION OF THE COLUMBIA REGION</h2>
  </div>

  <h3 id="Smohalla_VI">SMOHALLA</h3>

  <div class="subhead">
    <p>I have only one heart. Although you say, Go to another country, my heart is not that way. I do not want money for
      my land. I am here, and here is where I am going to be. I will not part with lands, and if you come again I will
      say the same thing. I will not part with my lands.—<i>Umatilla Chief.</i></p>

    <p>We have never made any trade. The earth is part of my body, and I never gave up the earth. So long as the earth
      keeps me I want to be let alone.—<i>Toohulhulsote.</i></p>

    <p>Their only troubles arise from the attempts of white men to encroach upon the reservations. I verily believe that
      were the snow-crowned summits of Mount Rainier set apart as an Indian reservation, white men would immediately
      commence jumping them.—<i>Superintendent Ross.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>About the time that the Paiute were preparing for the millennial dawn, we begin to hear of a “dreamer prophet” on
    the Columbia, called Smohalla, who was becoming a thorn in the flesh of the Indian agents in that quarter, and was
    reported to be organizing among the Indians a new religion which taught the destruction of the whites and resistance
    to the government, and made moral virtues of all the crimes in the catalog. One agent, in disregard of grammar if
    not of veracity, gravely reported that “the main object is to allow a plurality of wives, immunity from punishment
    for lawbreaking, and allowance of all the vices—especially drinking and gambling—are chief virtues in the believers
    of this religion.” (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 8.</i>)</p>

  <p>This was bad enough, but worse was behind it. It appeared that Smohalla and his followers, numbering perhaps about
    2,000 Indians of various tribes along the Columbia in eastern Washington and Oregon, had never made treaties giving
    up any of their lands, and consequently claimed the right to take salmon in the streams and dig kamas in the
    prairies of their ancestral country undisturbed and unmolested, and stoutly objected to going on any of the
    neighboring reservations at Yakima, Umatilla, or Warmspring. There is no doubt that justice and common sense were on
    the side of the Indians, for by the reports of the agents themselves it is shown that the dwellers on the
    reservations were generally neglected, poor, and miserable, and subjected to constant encroachments by the whites in
    spite of treaties and treaty lines, while at the same time that agents and superintendents were invoking the aid of
    the military to compel Smohalla’s followers to go on a reservation these same men were moving heaven and earth to
    force the Indians already on a reservation to give up their treaty rights and remove to another and less valuable
    location—to begin life anew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_709">709</span> under the fostering care of the
    government until such time as the white man should want them to move on again.</p>

  <p>These matters are treated at length in the annual reports of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, with the
    accompanying reports of superintendents and agents in charge of the reservations concerned, from 1870 to 1875. With
    regard to the Umatilla reservation, to which most strenuous efforts were made to remove the “renegades,” as they
    were called, Agent Boyle reports in 1870 (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 9</i>) that the Indians are “dispirited ... in consequence of
    the oft-repeated theme that their farms are to be taken from them and given to the white settlers.” He continues,
    “It is hardly to be expected that the Indians can retain this reservation much longer unless the strong arm of the
    government protects them. Daily I am called upon to notify the white settlers that they are encroaching upon the
    Indian lands.” He advises their removal to a permanent reservation, “knowing as I do that they must go sooner or
    later.” Again, “The agency has been established for the space of ten years, and I regret exceedingly that I have
    been most completely disappointed with what I see about me.” In discussing the removal of the Indians to a new
    reservation, Superintendent Meacham says of a considerable portion of them that it “would suit them better to be
    turned loose to look out for themselves.” (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 10.</i>)</p>

  <p>In 1873 Agent Cornoyer reported that the Indians numbered 837, by the census of 1870, which he believes was as
    correct as could then be taken, but “this number I think is now too high.” He continues:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Of the appropriation of $4,000 per annum for beneficial objects, not one single dollar of that fund has been
      turned over to me since September, 1871; and of the appropriation for incidental expenses of $40,000 per annum for
      the Indian service in this state, only $200 of that appropriation has been turned over to me during the same
      period of two years.... I would also beg leave to call your attention to that portion of my last annual report
      wherein I called the attention of the Department to the unfulfilled stipulations of the treaty of June 9, 1855,
      with these Indians. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 11.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Commissioner Brunot, in 1871, stated that the estimated number of Indians coming under the provisions of the treaty
    at the time it was made in 1855 was 3,500, and “by the census taken in 1870 the number was 1,622”—a decrease of
    nearly one-half in fifteen years. Of these only about half were on the reservation, the rest being on Columbia
    river, “never having partaken of the benefits of the treaty.” On the next page he tells us what some of these
    benefits are: “Maladministration of agents, and the misapplication of funds, the failure of the government to
    perform the promises of the treaty, and the fact that the Indians have been constantly agitated by assertions that
    the government intended their removal, and that their removal was urged for several years in succession in the
    reports of a former agent, thus taking away from them all incentives to improve their lands.” (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 12.</i>)</p>

  <p>In 1871 a commission was sent to Umatilla and other reservations, which gave the Indians a chance to speak for
    themselves. The Cayuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_710">710</span> chief, described as a Catholic Indian, in
    dress, personal appearance, and bearing superior to the average American farmer, said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This reservation is marked out for us. We see it with our eyes and our hearts. We all hold it with our bodies and
      our souls. Right out here are my father and mother, and brothers and sisters and children, all buried. I am
      guarding their graves. My friend, this reservation, this small piece of land, we look upon it as our mother, as if
      she were raising us. You come to ask me for my land. It is like as if we who are Indians were to be sent away and
      get lost.... What is the reason you white men who live near the reservation like my land and want to get it? You
      must not think so. My friends, you must not talk too strong about getting my land. I like my land and will not let
      it go.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Wallawalla chief said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I have tied all the reservation in my heart and it can not be loosened. It is dear as our bodies to us.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Umatilla chief said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Our red people were brought up here.... When my father and mother died, I was left here. They gave me rules and
      gave me their land to live upon. They left me to take care of them after they were buried. I was to watch over
      their graves. I do not wish to part with my land. I have felt tired working on my land, so tired that the sweat
      dropped off me on the ground. Where is all that Governor Stevens or General Palmer said [i.&nbsp;e., that it was to be
      a reservation for the Indians forever]? I am very fond of this land that is marked out for me.... Should I take
      only a small piece of ground and a white man sit down beside me, I fear there would be trouble all the time.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>An old man said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I am getting old now, and I want to die where my father and mother and children have died. I do not wish to leave
      this land and go off to some other land.... I see where I have sweat and worked in trying to get food. I love my
      church, my mills, my farm, the graves of my parents and children. I do not wish to leave my land. That is all my
      heart, and I show it to you.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A young chief said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I have only one heart, one tongue. Although you say, Go to another country, my heart is not that way. I do not
      wish for any money for my land. I am here, and here is where I am going to be.... I will not part with lands, and
      if you come again I will say the same thing. I will not part with my lands.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The commissioner who was conducting the negotiations, after enumerating the promises made to the Indians in return
    for the lands which they had surrendered under the original treaty of 1855, tells how some of these promises have
    been fulfilled:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>... A miserably inadequate supply of worn-out agricultural implements. A group of eight or ten dilapidated
      shanties used for the agency buildings. The physician promised has never resided upon the reservation, but lives
      and practices his profession at Pendleton. The hospital promised (fifteen years ago) has not yet been erected.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Of their ever-living grievance Colonel Ross, superintendent of the Washington agencies, says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Their only troubles arise from the attempts of white men to encroach upon the reservations. A mania prevails
      among a certain class of citizens in this direction. I verily <span class="pagenum" id="Page_711">711</span>
      believe that were the snow-crowned summits of Mount Rainier set apart as an Indian reservation, white
      men would immediately commence jumping them. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 14.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3 id="Nez_Perce_war">JOSEPH AND THE NEZ PERCÉ WAR</h3>

  <p>We first hear officially of Smohalla and his people from A. B. Meacham, superintendent of Indian affairs in Oregon,
    who states, in September, 1870, that—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>... One serious drawback [to the adoption of the white man’s road] is the existence among the Indians of Oregon
      of a peculiar religion called Smokeller or Dreamers, the chief doctrine of which is that the red man is again to
      rule the country, and this sometimes leads to rebellion against lawful authority.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A few pages farther on we learn the nature of this rebellion:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The next largest band (not on a reservation) is Smokeller’s, at Priest rapids, Washington territory. They also
      refused to obey my order to come in, made to them during the month of February last, of which full report was
      made. I would also recommend that they be removed to Umatilla by the military. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 15.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Three months before this report Congress had passed a bill appointing commissioners to negotiate with the tribes of
    Umatilla reservation “to ascertain upon what terms they would be willing to sell their lands and remove elsewhere,”
    and Meacham himself was the principal member of this commission. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 15.</i>)</p>

  <p>In 1872 Smohalla’s followers along the Columbia were reported to number 2,000, and his apostles were represented as
    constantly traveling from one reservation to another to win over new converts to his teachings. Repeated efforts had
    been made to induce them to go on the reservations in eastern Oregon and Washington, but without success. We are
    told now that—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>They have a new and peculiar religion, by the doctrines of which they are taught that a new god is coming to
      their rescue; that all the Indians who have died heretofore, and who shall die hereafter, are to be resurrected;
      that as they will then be very numerous and powerful, they will be able to conquer the whites, recover their
      lands, and live as free and unrestrained as their fathers lived in olden times. Their model of a man is an Indian.
      They aspire to be Indians and nothing else.... It is thought by those who know them best that they can not be made
      to go upon their reservations without at least being intimidated by the presence of a military force. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>,
      17.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We hear but little more of Smohalla and his doctrines for several years, until attention was again attracted to
    Indian affairs in the northwest by the growing dissatisfaction which culminated in the Nez Percé war of 1877. The
    Nez Percés, especially those who acknowledged the leadership of Chief Joseph, were largely under the influence of
    the Dreamer prophets, and there was reason to believe that an uprising inaugurated by so prominent a tribe would
    involve all the smaller tribes in sympathy with the general Indian belief. As soon therefore as it became evident
    that matters were approaching a crisis, a commission, of which General O. O. Howard was chief, was appointed to make
    some peaceable arrangement with the so-called “renegades” on the upper Columbia. The commissioners met Smohalla and
    his principal men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_712">712</span> at Wallula, Washington territory, on April 23,
    1877, and as a result of the council then held these non-treaty tribes, although insisting as strongly as ever on
    their right to live undisturbed in their own country, yet refrained from taking part in the war which broke out a
    few weeks later.</p>

  <p>It is foreign to our purpose to recount the history of the Nez Percé war of 1877. As is generally the case with
    Indian wars, it originated in the unauthorized intrusion of lawless whites on lands which the Indians claimed as
    theirs by virtue of occupancy from time immemorial. The Nez Percés, whom all authorities agree in representing as a
    superior tribe of Indians, originally inhabited the valleys of Clearwater and Salmon rivers in Idaho, with the
    country extending west of Snake river into Washington and Oregon as far as the Blue mountains. They are first
    officially noticed in the report of the Indian Commissioner for 1843, where they are described as “noble,
    industrious, sensible,” and well disposed toward the whites, while “though brave as Cæsar, the whites have nothing
    to dread at their hands in case of their dealing out to them what they conceive to be right and equitable.”
    (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 18.</i>) It being deemed advisable to bring them into more direct relations with the United States, the
    agent who made the report called the chiefs together in this year and “assured them of the kind intentions of our
    government, and of the sad consequences that would ensue to any white man, from this time, who should invade their
    rights.” (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 19.</i>) On the strength of these fair promises a portion of the tribe, in 1855, entered into a
    treaty by which they ceded a large part of their territory, and were guaranteed possession of the rest. In 1860,
    however, gold was discovered in the country, and the usual result followed. “In defiance of law, and despite the
    protestations of the Indian agent, a townsite was laid off in October, 1861, on the reservation, and Lewiston, with
    a population of 1,200, sprung into existence.” (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 20.</i>) A new treaty was then made in 1863, by which the
    intruders were secured in possession of what they had thus seized, and the Nez Percés were restricted within much
    narrower limits. By this treaty the Wallowa valley, in northeastern Oregon, the ancestral home of that part of the
    tribe under the leadership of Chief Joseph, was taken from the Indians. This portion of the tribe, however, had
    refused to have part in the negotiations, and “Chief Joseph and his band, utterly ignoring the treaty of 1863,
    continued to claim the Wallowa valley, where he was tacitly permitted to roam without restraint, until the
    encroachments of white settlers induced the government to take some definite action respecting this band of
    non-treaty Nez Percés.” (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 21.</i>) At this time the tribe numbered about 2,800, of whom about 500
    acknowledged Joseph as their chief.</p>

    <figcaption class="xsmall">CHIEF JOSEPH</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Collisions between the whites and Indians in the valley became more frequent, and one of Joseph’s band had been
    killed, when a commission was appointed in 1876 to induce the Indians to give up the Wallowa valley and remove to
    Lapwai reservation in Idaho. Joseph still refusing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_713">713</span> to remove, the
    matter was turned over to General Howard. On May 3, 1877, he held the first council with Joseph and his followers at
    Fort Lapwai. Their ceremonial approach, which was probably in accord with the ritual teachings of the Dreamer
    religion, is thus described by the general:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A long rank of men, followed by women and children, with faces painted, the red paint extending back into the
      partings of the hair—the men’s hair braided and tied up with showy strings—ornamented in dress, in hats, in
      blankets with variegated colors, in leggings of buckskin and moccasins beaded and plain; women with bright shawls
      or blankets, and skirts to the ankle and top moccasins. All were mounted on Indian ponies as various in color as
      the dress of the riders. These picturesque people, after keeping us waiting long enough for effect, came in sight
      from up the valley from the direction of their temporary camp just above the company gardens. They drew near to
      the hollow square of the post and in front of the small company to be interviewed. Then they struck up their song.
      They were not armed except with a few tomahawk pipes that could be smoked with the peaceful tobacco or penetrate
      the skull bone of an enemy, at the will of the holder. Yet somehow this wild sound produced a strange effect. It
      made one feel glad that there were but fifty of them, and not five hundred. It was shrill and searching; sad, like
      a wail, and yet defiant in its close. The Indians swept around outside the fence and made the entire circuit,
      still keeping up the song as they rode. The buildings broke the refrain into irregular bubblings of sound until
      the ceremony was completed. (<i><a href="#Howard">Howard</a>, 1.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>At this conference Toohulhulsote, the principal Dreamer priest of Joseph’s band, acted as spokesman for the
    Indians, and insisted, according to the Smohalla doctrine, that the earth was his mother, that she should not be
    disturbed by hoe or plow, that men should subsist by the spontaneous productions of nature, and that the sovereignty
    of the earth could not be sold or given away. Continuing, he asserted, “We never have made any trade. Part of the
    Indians gave up their land. I never did. The earth is part of my body, and I never gave up the earth. So long as the
    earth keeps me I want to be left alone.” General Howard finally ordered him under arrest, after which the Indians at
    last agreed to go on a reservation by June 14. (<i><a href="#Howard">Howard</a>, 2.</i>) A few days later, councils were held with
    Smohalla and his people, and with Moses, another noted “renegade” chief with a considerable following farther up the
    Columbia. Both chiefs, representing at least 500 warriors, disclaimed any hostile intentions and agreed to go on
    reservations. Smohalla said, “Your law is my law. I say to you, yes. I will be on a reservation by September.”
    (<i><a href="#Howard">Howard</a>, 3.</i>) Parties under Joseph and other leading chiefs then went out to select suitable locations for
    reservations, Joseph and his band deciding in favor of Lapwai valley. Everything was moving smoothly toward a speedy
    and peaceful settlement of all difficulties, and the commission had already reported the successful accomplishment
    of the work, when a single act of lawless violence undid the labor of weeks and precipitated a bloody war.
    (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 22.</i>)</p>

  <p>One of Joseph’s band had been murdered by whites some time before, but the Indians had remained quiet. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>,
    23.</i>) Now, while the Nez Percés were gathering up their stock to remove to the reservation selected, a band of
    white robbers attacked them, ran off the cattle, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_714">714</span> killed one
    of the party in charge. Joseph could no longer restrain his warriors, and on June 13, 1877—one day before the date
    that had been appointed for going on the reservation—the enraged Nez Percés attacked the neighboring settlement on
    White Bird creek, Idaho, and killed 21 persons.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The
    war was begun. The troops under Howard were ordered out. The first fight occurred on June 17 at Hangman’s creek and
    resulted in the loss of 34 soldiers. Then came another on July 4 with a loss of 13 more. Then on July 12 another
    encounter by troops under General Howard himself, in which 11 soldiers were killed and 26 wounded. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>,
    24.</i>)</p>

  <p>Then began one of the most remarkable exhibitions of generalship in the history of our Indian wars, a retreat
    worthy to be remembered with that of the storied ten thousand. With hardly a hundred warriors, and impeded by more
    than 350 helpless women and children—with General Howard behind, with Colonel (General) Miles in front, and with
    Colonel Sturgis and the Crow scouts coming down upon his flank—Chief Joseph led his little band up the Clearwater
    and across the mountains into Montana, turning at Big Hole pass long enough to beat back his pursuers with a loss of
    60 men; then on by devious mountain trails southeast into Yellowstone park, where he again turned on Howard and
    drove him back with additional loss of men and horses; then out of Wyoming and north into Montana again, hoping to
    find safety on Canadian soil, until intercepted in the neighborhood of the Yellowstone by Colonel Sturgis in front
    with fresh troops and a detachment of Crow scouts, with whom they sustained two more encounters, this time with
    heavy loss of men and horses to themselves; then again eluding their pursuers, this handful of starving and worn-out
    warriors, now reduced to scarcely fifty able men, carrying their wounded and their helpless families, crossed the
    Missouri and entered the Bearpaw mountains. But new enemies were on their trail, and at last, when within 50 miles
    of the land of refuge, Miles, with a fresh army, cut off their retreat by a decisive blow, capturing more than half
    their horses, killing a number of the band, including Joseph’s brother and the noted chief Looking Glass, and
    wounding 40 others. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 25.</i>)</p>

  <p>Forced either to surrender or to abandon the helpless wounded, the women, and children, Joseph chose to surrender
    to Colonel Miles, on October 5, 1877, after a masterly retreat of more than a thousand miles. He claimed that this
    was “a conditional surrender, with a distinct promise that he should go back to Idaho in the spring.” (<i>Comr.,
    26.</i>) The statement of General Howard’s aid-de-camp is explicit on this point:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It was promised Joseph that he would be taken to Tongue river and kept there till spring, and then be returned to
      Idaho. General Sheridan, ignoring the promises made <span class="pagenum" id="Page_715">715</span>on the
      battlefield, ostensibly on account of the difficulty of getting supplies there from Fort Buford, ordered the
      hostiles to Leavenworth, ... but different treatment was promised them when they held rifles in their hands.
      (<i><a href="#Sutherland">Sutherland</a>, 1.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Seven years passed before the promise was kept, and in the meantime the band had been reduced by disease and death
    in Indian Territory from about 450 to about 280.</p>

  <p>This strong testimony to the high character of Joseph, and his people and the justice of their cause comes from the
    commissioner at the head of Indian affairs during and immediately after the outbreak:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I traveled with him in Kansas and the Indian Territory for nearly a week and found him to be one of the most
      gentlemanly and well-behaved Indians that I ever met. He is bright and intelligent, and is anxious for the welfare
      of his people.... The Nez Percés are very much superior to the Osages and Pawnees in the Indian Territory; they
      are even brighter than the Poncas, and care should be taken to place them where they will thrive.... It will be
      borne in mind that Joseph has never made a treaty with the United States, and that he has never surrendered to the
      government the lands he claimed to own in Idaho.... I had occasion in my last annual report to say that “Joseph
      and his followers have shown themselves to be brave men and skilled soldiers, who, with one exception, have
      observed the rules of civilized warfare, and have not mutilated their dead enemies.” These Indians were encroached
      upon by white settlers on soil they believed to be their own, and when these encroachments became intolerable they
      were compelled, in their own estimation, to take up arms. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 27a.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In all our sad Indian history there is nothing to exceed in pathetic eloquence the surrender speech of the Nez
    Percé chief:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed. Looking Glass is dead. Toohulhulsote is dead. The old men are all
      dead. It is the young men who say yes or no. He who led the young men is dead. It is cold and we have no blankets.
      The little children are freezing to death. My people, some of them, have run away to the hills and have no
      blankets, no food. No one knows where they are—perhaps freezing to death. I want to have time to look for my
      children and see how many of them I can find. Maybe I shall find them among the dead. Hear me, my chiefs. I am
      tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever. (<i><a href="#War">Sec. War</a>, 3.</i>)<p>

      SMOHALLA AND HIS DOCTRINE</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subhead">
    <p>My young men shall never work. Men who work can not dream, and wisdom comes to us in dreams.... You ask me to
      plow the ground. Shall I take a knife and tear my mother’s bosom? You ask me to dig for stone. Shall I dig under
      her skin for her bones? You ask me to cut grass and make hay and sell it and be rich like white men. But how dare
      I cut off my mother’s hair?—<i>Smohalla.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>We hear little of Smohalla for several years after the Nez Percé war until the opening of the Northern Pacific
    railroad in 1883 once more brought to a focus the land grievances of the Indians in that section. Along Yakima
    valley the railroad “was located through Indian fields and orchards, with little respect for individual rights,”
    while the host of prospective settlers who at once swarmed into the country showed the usual white man’s
    consideration for the native proprietors. Some of the Indians, breaking away from their old traditions in order to
    obtain permanent homes before everything should be taken up by the whites, had gone out and selected homesteads
    under the law, and the agent was now using the Indian police to compel them to return to the reservation, “and the
    singular anomaly was presented of the United States Indian agent on the one hand applying for troops to drive the
    Indians from their homestead settlements to the reservation a hundred miles away, and on the other the Indians
    telegraphing to the military authorities to send troops to protect them from the Indian police.” (<i><a href="#MacMurray">MacMurray</a>
    MS.</i>) In addition to their land troubles the Yakima and their confederated tribes, among whom were many
    progressive and even prosperous Indians, were restive under constant interference with their religious (Smohalla)
    ceremonies, to which a large proportion adhered.</p>

  <p>In order to learn the nature of the dissatisfaction of the Indians, and if possible to remove the cause, General
    Miles, then commanding the military department of the Columbia, sent Major J. W. MacMurray to the scene of the
    disturbance in June, 1884. He spent about a year in the work, visiting the various villages of the upper Columbia,
    especially Pʿnä at Priest rapids, where he met Smohalla, the high priest of the Dreamer theology, and his report on
    the subject is invaluable.</p>

  <p>Smohalla is the chief of the Wa′napûm, a small tribe in Washington, numbering probably less than 200 souls,
    commonly known rather indefinitely as “Columbia River Indians,” and roaming along both banks of the Columbia from
    the neighborhood of Priest rapids down to the entrance of Snake river. They are of Shahaptian stock and closely akin
    to the Yakima and Nez Percés, and have never made a treaty with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_717">
    717</span>the government. Among his own people and his disciples in the neighboring tribes he is known as
    Shmóqûla, “The Preacher.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He is also frequently called
    Yu′yunipĭ′tqana, “The Shouting Mountain,” from a belief among his followers that a part of his revelation came to
    him from a mountain which became instinct with life and spoke into his soul while he lay dreaming upon it. Still
    another name by which he is sometimes known is Waip-shwa, or “Rock Carrier,” the reason for which does not appear.
    The name which belonged to him in youth, before assuming his priestly function, is now forgotten. For more than
    forty years he has resided at the Wanapûm village of Pʿnä on the west bank of the Columbia, at the foot of Priest
    rapids, in what is now Yakima county, Washington. The name Pʿnä signifies “a fish weir,” this point being a great
    rendezvous for the neighboring tribes during the salmon-fishing season. These frequent gatherings afford abundant
    opportunity for the teaching and dissemination of his peculiar doctrines, as is sufficiently evident from the fact
    that, while his own tribe numbers hardly two score families, his disciples along the river are counted by thousands.</p>

      <span class="xsmall">INCLUDING ALL THOSE OF THE SMOHALLA AND SHAKER RELIGIONS<br>
      BY</span><br>JAMES MOONEY<br>1894</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Smohalla was born about 1815 or 1820, and is consequently now an old man, although still well preserved, and with
    his few scattering locks unchanged in color. At the time of the Nez Percé war he was in the full vigor of manhood.
    His appearance in 1884 is thus described by Major MacMurray: “In person Smohalla is peculiar. Short, thick-set,
    bald-headed and almost hunch-backed, he is not prepossessing at first sight, but he has an almost Websterian head,
    with a deep brow over bright, intelligent eyes. He is a finished orator. His manner is mostly of the bland,
    insinuating, persuasive style, but when aroused he is full of fire and seems to handle invectives effectively. His
    audience seemed spellbound under his magic manner, and it never lost interest to me, though he spoke in a language
    comprehended by few white men and translated to me at second or third hand.” By another writer who met him a year
    later he is described as rather undersized and inclining toward obesity, with “a reserved and cunning but not
    ill-natured countenance, and a large, well-shaped head. His manners were more suave and insinuating than is usual
    with Indians.” He had a comfortable appearance, his moccasins and leggings were new, and he rode a good pinto pony.
    (<i><a href="#Huggins">Huggins</a>, 1.</i>)</p>

  <p>In his youth he had frequented the Catholic mission of Atahnam among the Yakima, where he became familiar with the
    forms of that service and also acquired a slight knowledge of French. Whether or not he was a regular member of the
    mission school is a disputed point, as it is asserted by some that he has never worn the white man’s dress <span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_718">718</span>or had his hair cut. The influence of the Catholic ceremonial is
    plainly visible in his own ritual performance. In his early manhood he distinguished himself as a warrior, and had
    already come to be regarded as a prominent man when he first began to preach his peculiar theology about the year
    1850. There can be no question that the rapid spread of his doctrines among the tribes of the Columbia materially
    facilitated their confederation in the Yakima war of 1855–56. It is said that he aspired to be the leader in this
    war, and that, to attain this end, he invited all the neighboring bands to attend a council at his village of Pʿnä,
    but failed to accomplish his object.</p>

  <p>Shortly after the close of the war, probably about 1860, the incident occurred which wrought an entire change in
    his life, stamping him as an oracle and prophet beyond peradventure, and giving to his religious system the force of
    authority which it has ever since retained. He had already established a reputation as a medicine-man, and was
    believed to be “making medicine” against the life of Moses, the noted chief of a tribe farther up the river, who was
    greatly in dread of his occult powers, and forced a quarrel in order to rid himself forever of his rival. A fight
    resulted, and Smohalla was nearly killed. It is said that he was left on the ground as dead, but revived
    sufficiently to crawl away and get into a boat on the bank of the Columbia near by. Bleeding and disabled, he was
    carried down at the mercy of the current until he was finally rescued from his perilous position by some white men,
    far below. His recovery was slow. When it was completed, unwilling to return in disgrace to his own country and
    probably still dreading the anger of Moses, he determined to become a wanderer.</p>

  <p>Then began one of the most remarkable series of journeyings ever undertaken by an uncivilized Indian. Going down
    the Columbia to Portland and the coast, he turned south, and, stopping on the way at various points in Oregon and
    California, continued beyond San Diego into Mexico. Then, turning again, he came back through Arizona, Utah, and
    Nevada to his former home on the Columbia, where he announced that he had been dead and in the spirit world and had
    now returned by divine command to guide his people. As he was thought to have been killed in the encounter with
    Moses, and as he had disappeared so completely until now, his awe-stricken hearers readily believed that they were
    actually in the presence of one who had been taken bodily into the spirit world, whence he was now sent back as a
    teacher.</p>

  <p>On the occasion of MacMurray’s visit, says that authority, “Smohalla asked me many geographic questions, and I
    spread out a railroad map, marking the situation of Priest rapids, Portland, and Vancouver barracks, and he traced
    with a straw down the coast line to below San Diego. He asked where San Bernardino was, and paused long over this.
    He recognized the ocean or ‘salt chuck,’ with many other geographic features and localities, but he would neither
    admit nor deny having been at Salt Lake City, although he admitted having been in Utah,<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_719">719</span> knew the lake and adjacent mountain chains, and said that he had seen Mormon priests
    getting commands direct from heaven. He dwelt long over Arizona, and remarked, ‘<i>bad-a Inchun</i>.’”</p>

  <p>Smohalla now declared to his people that the Sa′ghalee Tyee, the Great Chief Above, was angry at their apostasy,
    and commanded them through him to return to their primitive manners, as their present miserable condition in the
    presence of the intrusive race was due to their having abandoned their own religion and violated the laws of nature
    and the precepts of their ancestors. He then explained in detail the system to which they must adhere in future if
    they would conform to the expressed will of the higher power. It was a system based on the primitive aboriginal
    mythology and usage, with an elaborate ritual which combined with the genuine Indian features much of what he had
    seen and remembered of Catholic ceremonial and military parade, with perhaps also some additions from Mormon forms.</p>

  <p>His words made a deep impression on his hearers. They had indeed abandoned their primitive simplicity to a great
    extent, and were now suffering the penalty in all the misery that had come to them with the advent of the white-skin
    race that threatened to blot them out from the earth. The voice of the prophet was accepted as a voice from the
    other world, for they knew that he had been dead and was now alive. What he said must be true and wise, for he had
    been everywhere and knew tribes and countries they had never heard of. Even the white men confirmed his words in
    this regard. He could even control the sun and the moon, for he had said when they would be dark, and they were
    dark.</p>

  <p>If genius be a form of insanity, as has been claimed, intense religious enthusiasm would seem to have a close
    connection with physical as well as mental disease. Like Mohammed and Joan of Arc, and like the Shaker prophet of
    Puget sound, Smohalla is subject to cataleptic trances, and it is while in this unconscious condition that he is
    believed to receive his revelations. Says MacMurray:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>He falls into trances and lies rigid for considerable periods. Unbelievers have experimented by sticking needles
      through his flesh, cutting him with knives, and otherwise testing his sensibility to pain, without provoking any
      responsive action. It was asserted that he was surely dead, because blood did not flow from the wounds. These
      trances always excite great interest and often alarm, as he threatens to abandon his earthly body altogether
      because of the disobedience of his people, and on each occasion they are in a state of suspense as to whether the
      Saghalee Tyee will send his soul back to earth to reoccupy his body, or will, on the contrary, abandon and leave
      them without his guidance. It is this going into long trances, out of which he comes as from heavy sleep and
      almost immediately relates his experiences in the spirit land, that gave rise to the title of “Dreamers,” or
      believers in dreams, commonly given to his followers by the neighboring whites. His actions are similar to those
      of a trance medium, and if self-hypnotization be practicable that would seem to explain it. I questioned him as to
      his trances and hoped to have him explain them to me, but he avoided the subject and was angered when I pressed
      him. He manifestly believes all he says of what occurs to him in this trance state. As we <span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_720">720</span>have hundreds of thousands of educated white people who believe in similar
      fallacies, this is not more unlikely in an Indian subjected to such influence.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In studying Smohalla we have to deal with the same curious mixture of honest conviction and cunning deception that
    runs through the history of priestcraft in all the ages. Like some other prophets before him, he seeks to convey the
    idea that he is in control of the elements and the heavenly bodies, and he has added greatly to his reputation by
    predicting several eclipses. This he was enabled to do by the help of an almanac and some little explanation from a
    party of surveyors. In this matter, however, he was soon made to realize that a little knowledge is a dangerous
    thing. He could not get another almanac, and his astronomic prophecies came to an abrupt termination at the end of
    the first year. Concerning this, Major MacMurray says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>He showed me an almanac of a preceding year and asked me to readjust it for eclipses, as it did not work as it
      had formerly done. I explained that Washington (the Naval Observatory) made new ones every year, and that old ones
      could not be fixed up to date. He had probably obtained this one from the station agent at the railroad, now
      superseded by a new one, who had cut off Smohalla’s supply of astronomical data. My inability to repair the 1882
      almanac for use in prognosticating in 1884 cost me much of his respect as a wise man from the east. (<i><a href="#MacMurray">MacMurray</a>
      MS.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Smohalla had also a blank book containing mysterious characters, some of which resembled letters of the alphabet,
    and which he said were records of events and prophecies. MacMurray was unable to decide whether they were mnemonic
    or were simply unmeaning marks intended to foster among his followers the impression of his superior wisdom. It is
    probable that they were genuine mnemonic symbols invented by himself for his own purposes, as such systems, devised
    and used by single individuals or families, and unintelligible to others, are by no means rare among those who may
    be called the literary men of our aboriginal tribes.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>As their principal troubles arose out of the disputed title to their lands, Major MacMurray was asked by the
    Indians to explain the Indian homestead law and how white men divided land. This was carefully done with the aid of
    a checkerboard, and they were shown how the land was mapped out into equal squares arranged on straight lines so
    that every man could find his own. They were then urged by the officer to apply for homesteads and settle upon them
    so as to avoid further trouble with the new settlers who were pouring into the country. Smohalla replied that he
    knew all this, but he did not like the new law, as it was against nature. He then went on to expound in detail the
    Indian cosmogony. Said he:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I will tell you about it. Once the world was all water and God lived alone. He was lonesome, he had no place to
      put his foot, so he scratched the sand up from the bottom and made the land, and he made the rocks, and he made
      trees, and he made a man; and the man had wings and could go anywhere. The man was lonesome, and God made a woman.
      They ate fish from the water, and God made the deer and other animals, and he sent the man to hunt and told the
      woman to cook the meat and to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_721">721</span>dress the skins. Many more men
      and women grew up, and they lived on the banks of the great river whose waters were full of salmon. The mountains
      contained much game and there were buffalo on the plains. There were so many people that the stronger ones
      sometimes oppressed the weak and drove them from the best fisheries, which they claimed as their own. They fought
      and nearly all were killed, and their bones are to be seen in the hills yet. God was very angry at this and he
      took away their wings and commanded that the lands and fisheries should be common to all who lived upon them; that
      they were never to be marked off or divided, but that the people should enjoy the fruits that God planted in the
      land, and the animals that lived upon it, and the fishes in the water. God said he was the father and the earth
      was the mother of mankind; that nature was the law; that the animals, and fish, and plants obeyed nature, and that
      man only was sinful. This is the old law.</p>

    <p>I know all kinds of men. First there were my people (the Indians); God made them first. Then he made a Frenchman
      [referring to the Canadian voyagers of the Hudson Bay company], and then he made a priest [priests accompanied
      these expeditions of the Hudson Bay company]. A long time after that came Boston men [Americans are thus called in
      the Chinook jargon, because the first of our nation came into the Columbia river in 1796 in a ship from Boston],
      and then King George men [the English]. Later came black men, and last God made a Chinaman with a tail. He is of
      no account and has to work all the time like a woman. All these are new people. Only the Indians are of the old
      stock. After awhile, when God is ready, he will drive away all the people except those who have obeyed his laws.<p>

    <p>Those who cut up the lands or sign papers for lands will be defrauded of their rights and will be punished by
      God’s anger. Moses was bad. God did not love him. He sold his people’s houses and the graves of their dead. It is
      a bad word that comes from Washington. It is not a good law that would take my people away from me to make them
      sin against the laws of God.</p>

    <p>You ask me to plow the ground! Shall I take a knife and tear my mother’s bosom? Then when I die she will not take
      me to her bosom to rest.</p>

    <p>You ask me to dig for stone! Shall I dig under her skin for her bones? Then when I die I can not enter her body
      to be born again.</p>

    <p>You ask me to cut grass and make hay and sell it, and be rich like white men! But how dare I cut off my mother’s
      hair?</p>

    <p>It is a bad law, and my people can not obey it. I want my people to stay with me here. All the dead men will come
      to life again. Their spirits will come to their bodies again. We must wait here in the homes of our fathers and be
      ready to meet them in the bosom of our mother. (<i><a href="#MacMurray">MacMurray</a> MS.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The idea that the earth is the mother of all created things lies at the base, not only of the Smohalla religion,
    but of the theology of the Indian tribes generally and of primitive races all over the world. This explains
    Tecumtha’s reply to Harrison: “The sun is my father and the earth is my mother. On her bosom I will rest.” In the
    Indian mind the corn, fruits, and edible roots are the gifts which the earth-mother gives freely to her children.
    Lakes and ponds are her eyes, hills are her breasts, and streams are the milk flowing from her breasts. Earthquakes
    and underground noises are signs of her displeasure at the wrongdoing of her children. Especially are the malarial
    fevers, which often follow extensive disturbance of the surface by excavation or otherwise, held to be direct
    punishments for the crime of lacerating her bosom.</p>

  <p>Smohalla’s chief supporter and assistant at the ceremonies was Kotai′aqan, or Coteea′kun, as MacMurray spells it,
    of the Yakima tribe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_722">722</span> The name refers to a brood of young ducks
    scattering in alarm. He was the son of Kamai′äkan, the great war chief of the Yakima. He also gave MacMurray the
    story of the cosmos, which agrees with that obtained from Smohalla, but is more in detail:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The world was all water, and Saghalee Tyee was above it. He threw up out of the water at shallow places large
      quantities of mud, and that made the land. Some was piled so high that it froze hard, and the rains that fell were
      made into snow and ice. Some of the earth was made hard into rocks, and anyone could see that it had not
      changed—it was only harder. We have no records of the past; but we have it from our fathers from far back that
      Saghalee Tyee threw down many of the mountains he had made. It is all as our fathers told us, and we can see that
      it is true when we are hunting for game or berries in the mountains. I did not see it done. He made trees to grow,
      and he made a man out of a ball of mud and instructed him in what he should do. When the man grew lonesome, he
      made a woman as his companion, and taught her to dress skins, and to gather berries, and to make baskets of the
      bark of roots, which he taught her how to find.</p>

    <p>She was asleep and dreaming of her ignorance of how to please man, and she prayed to Saghalee Tyee to help her.
      He breathed on her and gave her something that she could not see, or hear, or smell, or touch, and it was
      preserved in a little basket, and by it all the arts of design and skilled handiwork were imparted to her
      descendants.</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding all the benefits they enjoyed, there was quarreling among the people, and the earth-mother was
      angry. The mountains that overhung the river at the Cascades were thrown down, and dammed the stream and destroyed
      the forests and whole tribes, and buried them under the rocks. (<i><a href="#MacMurray">MacMurray</a> MS.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In connection with the wonderful little basket, MacMurray states that Kotai′aqan presented him with a very ancient
    drum-shape basket, about 2½ inches in diameter, to give to his wife, in order that she might likewise be
    inspired. Concerning the catastrophe indicated in the last paragraph, he goes on to say:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Cascade range, where it crosses the Columbia river, exhibits enormous cross sections of lava, and at its base
      are petrified trunks of trees, which have been covered and hidden from view except where the wash of the mighty
      stream has exposed them. Indians have told me, of their knowledge, that, buried deep under these outpours of
      basalt, or volcanic tufa, are bones of animals of <i>siah</i>, or the long ago. Traditions of the great landslide
      at the Cascades are many, but vary little in form. According to one account, the mountain tops fell together and
      formed a kind of arch, under which the water flowed, until the overhanging rocks finally fell into the stream and
      made a dam or gorge. As the rock is columnar basalt, very friable and easily disintegrated, that was not
      impossible, and the landscape suggests some such giant avalanche. The submerged trees are plainly visible near
      this locality. Animal remains I have not seen, but these salmon-eating Indians have lived on the river’s border
      through countless ages, and know every feature in their surroundings by constant association for generations, and
      naturally ally these facts with their religious theories. (<i><a href="#MacMurray">MacMurray</a> MS.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In an article on “The submerged trees of the Columbia river,” in Science of February 18, 1887, the geologist, Major
    Clarence E. Dutton, also notices the peculiar formation at the Cascades and mentions the Indian tradition of a
    natural bridge over the river at this point.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>MacMurray continues:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Coteeakun went on to say that some day Saghalee Tyee would again overturn the mountains and so expose these
      bones, which, having been preserved through so long <span class="pagenum" id="Page_723">723</span>a time,
      would be reoccupied by the spirits which now dwell in the mountain tops, watching their descendants on earth and
      waiting for the resurrection to come. The voices of these spirits of the dead can be heard at all times in the
      mountains, and often they answer back when spoken to. Mourners who wail for their dead hear spirit voices
      replying, and know they will always remain near them. No man knows when it will come, and only those who have
      observed nature’s laws and adhered to the faith of their ancestors will have their bones so preserved and be
      certain of an earthly tenement for their spirits. He wanted me to confirm this.</p>

    <p>Coteeakun was pacific and gentle. He said all men were as brothers to him and he hoped all would dwell together.
      He had been told that white and black and all other kinds of men originally dwelt in tents, as the red men always
      have done, and that God in former times came to commune with white men. He thought there could be only one
      Saghalee Tyee, in which case white and red men would live on a common plane. We came from one source of life and
      in time would “grow from one stem again. It would be like a stick that the whites held by one end and the Indians
      by the other until it was broken, and it would be made again into one stick.”</p>

    <p>Some of the wilder Indians to the north have more truculent ideas as to the final cataclysm which is to
      reoverturn the mountains and bring back the halcyon days of the long past. As the whites and the others came only
      within the lifetime of the fathers of these Indians, they are not to be included in the benefits of the
      resurrection, but are to be turned over with all that the white man’s civilization has put upon the present
      surface of the land.</p>

    <p>Coteeakun was for progress—limited progress, it is true—to the extent of fixed homes and agriculture, but he did
      not want his people to go from their villages or to abandon their religious faith. They were nearly all disposed
      to work for wages among the farmers, and had orchards and some domestic animals upon whose produce they lived,
      besides the fish from the rivers. Smohalla opposed anything that pertained to civilization, and had neither
      cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, nor chickens, and not a tree or vegetable was grown anywhere in his vicinage. Kowse
      (<i>Peucedanum cous</i>), kamas (<i>Camassia esculenta</i>), berries, fish, and the game of the mountains alone
      furnished food to his people, whom he advised to resist every advance of civilization as improper for a true
      Indian and in violation of the faith of their ancestors. I found, however, that he was willing to advise his
      people to take up lands and adopt the white man’s road, if the government would pension him as it had pensioned
      Chief Moses, so that while I thought he believed in his religion as much as other sectarians do in theirs, he was
      tainted by the mercenary desire to live upon his followers unless otherwise provided for by the government.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>From Captain E. L. Huggins, Second cavalry, who visited Smohalla about the same time, we obtain further information
    concerning the prophet’s personality and doctrines. When Smohalla was urged to follow the example of other Indians
    who had taken up the white man’s road, he replied, “No one has any respect for these book Indians. Even the white
    men like me better and treat me better than they do the book Indians. My young men shall never work. Men who work
    can not dream, and wisdom comes to us in dreams.”</p>

  <p>When it was argued that the whites worked and yet knew more than the Indians, he replied that the white man’s
    wisdom was poor and weak and of no value to Indians, who must learn the highest wisdom from dreams and from
    participating in the Dreamer ceremonies. Being pressed to explain the nature of this higher knowledge, he replied,
    “Each one must learn for himself the highest wisdom. It can not be taught. You have the wisdom of your race. Be
    content.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_724">724</span></p>

  <p>When the officer contended that even the Indians had to work hard during the fishing season to get food for winter,
    the prophet answered:</p>

  <p>“This work lasts only for a few weeks. Besides it is natural work and does them no harm. But the work of the white
    man hardens soul and body. Nor is it right to tear up and mutilate the earth as white men do.”</p>

  <p>To the officer’s assertion that the Indians also dug roots and were even then digging kamas in the mountains, he
    replied:</p>

  <p>“We simply take the gifts that are freely offered. We no more harm the earth than would an infant’s fingers harm
    its mother’s breast. But the white man tears up large tracts of land, runs deep ditches, cuts down forests, and
    changes the whole face of the earth. You know very well this is not right. Every honest man,” said he, looking at me
    searchingly, “knows in his heart that this is all wrong. But the white men are so greedy they do not consider these
    things.”</p>

  <p>He asserted that the Indians were now so helpless before the white men that they must cease to exist unless they
    had assistance from a higher power, but that if they heeded the sacred message they would receive strong and sudden
    help as surely as the spring comes after winter. When some doubt was expressed as to his own faith in these things,
    he asked pointedly:</p>

  <p>“Do the white teachers believe what they teach?”</p>

  <p>“It is said, Smohalla, that you hate all white men.”</p>

  <p>“It is not true. But the whites have caused us great suffering. Dr Whitman many years ago made a long journey to
    the east to get a bottle of poison for us. He was gone about a year, and after he came back strong and terrible
    diseases broke out among us. The Indians killed Dr Whitman, but it was too late. He had uncorked his bottle and all
    the air was poisoned. Before that there was little sickness among us, but since then many of us have died. I have
    had children and grandchildren, but they are all dead. My last grandchild, a young woman of 16, died last month. If
    only her infant could have lived”—his voice faltered slightly, but with scarcely a pause he continued in his former
    tone, “I labored hard to save them, but my medicine would not work as it used to.”</p>

  <p>He repelled the idea that the Indians had profited by the coming of the whites, and especially denied that they had
    obtained ponies from this source. His statement on this point may be of interest to those who hold that the horse is
    indigenous to America:</p>

  <p>“What! The white man gave us ponies? Oh, no; we had ponies long before we ever saw white people. The Great Spirit
    gave them to us. Our horses were swifter and more enduring, too, in those days, before they were mixed with the
    white man’s horses.”</p>

  <p>He went on to tell how the Indians had befriended the first explorers who came among them and how ungrateful had
    been their later recompense, and said: “We are now so few and weak that we can offer no resistance, and their
    preachers have persuaded them to let a few of us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_725">725</span> live, so as to
    claim credit with the Great Spirit for being generous and humane. But they begrudge us what little grass our ponies
    eat.” At parting he repeated earnestly, “If they tell you Smohalla hates all white people, do not believe it.”
    (<i><a href="#Huggins">Huggins</a>, 2.</i>)</p>

  <p class="p2">Our knowledge of the Smohalla ritual is derived from the account given by Major MacMurray and from the statements
    of Yakima and Pälus informants. The officer’s account is that of an intelligent observer, who noted ceremonies
    closely, but without fully comprehending their meaning. The Indian account is that of initiates and true believers,
    one of them being the regular interpreter of the Smohalla services on Yakima reservation.</p>

  <p>The officer had already seen the ceremonial performances at the Indian villages at Celilo and Umatilla in Oregon,
    at Tumwater and Yakima gap in Washington, but found its greatest development at the fountain head, the home of
    Smohalla at Priest rapids. His account is so full of interest that we give it almost in its entirety.</p>

  <p>While still several miles away, his party discovered the village, the houses extending along the bank of the river,
    with several flags attached to long poles fluttering in the wind. The trail from the mountains was winding and
    difficult, but at last—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We reached the plain and were met by a procession, headed by Smohalla in person, all attired in gorgeous array
      and mounted on their best chargers. We wended our way through sagebrush and sand dunes to the village street, not
      a soul being visible, but from the mat-roofed salmon houses there came forth the most indescribable chorus of bell
      ringing, drum beating, and screeching. I noticed that the street was neatly swept and well sprinkled—an unusual
      thing in any Indian village. This, Smohalla said, was in my honor and to show that his people had cleanly tastes.
      Our procession passed on beyond the village to a new canvas tent, which had a brush shade to keep off the sun and
      was lined and carpeted with new and very pretty matting. Smohalla said this had been prepared especially for me,
      and was to be my house as long as I should stay with him. To cap the climax, he had constructed a bench for me,
      having sent more than 90 miles for the nails. Fresh salmon, caught in a peculiar trap among the rocks and broiled
      on a plank, were regularly furnished my party, and with hard tack and coffee of our own supplying we got enough to
      eat and drink. Our own blankets furnished sleeping conveniences. The river was within two yards of our tent door
      and was an ample lavatory.</p>

    <p>When I awoke the next morning, the sound of drums was again heard, and for days it continued. I do not remember
      that there was any intermission except for a few minutes at a time. Seven bass drums were used for the purpose. I
      was invited to be present, and took great interest in the ceremonies, which I shall endeavor to describe.</p>

    <p>There was a small open space to the north of the larger house, which was Smohalla’s residence and the village
      assembly room as well. This space was inclosed by a whitewashed fence made of boards which had drifted down the
      river. In the middle was a flagstaff with a rectangular flag, suggesting a target. In the center of the flag was a
      round red patch. The field was yellow, representing grass, which is there of a yellow hue in summer. A green
      border indicated the boundary of the world, the hills being moist and green near their tops. At the top of the
      flag was a small extension of blue color, with a white star in the center. Smohalla explained: “This is my flag,
      and it represents the world. God told me to look after my people—all are my people. There are four ways in the
      world—north and south and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_726">726</span>east and west. I have been all those
      ways. This is the center. I live here. The red spot is my heart—everybody can see it. The yellow grass grows
      everywhere around this place. The green mountains are far away all around the world. There is only water beyond,
      salt water. The blue [referring to the blue cloth strip] is the sky, and the star is the north star. That star
      never changes; it is always in the same place. I keep my heart on that star. I never change.”</p>

    <p>There are frequent services, a sort of processional around the outside of the fence, the prophet and a small boy
      with a bell entering the inclosure, where, after hoisting the flag, he delivers a sort of sermon. Captains or
      class leaders give instructions to the people, who are arranged according to stature, the men and women in
      different classes marching in single file to the sound of drums. There seems to be a regular system of signals, at
      command of the prophet, by the boy with the bell, upon which the people chant loud or low, quick or slow, or
      remain silent. These outdoor services occurred several times each day.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Smohalla invited me to participate in what he considered a grand ceremonial service within the larger house. This
      house was built with a framework of stout logs placed upright in the ground and roofed over with brush, or with
      canvas in rainy weather. The sides consisted of bark and rush matting. It was about 75 feet long by 25 feet wide.
      Singing and drumming had been going on for some time when I arrived. The air resounded with the voices of hundreds
      of Indians, male and female, and the banging of drums. Within, the room was dimly lighted. Smoke curled from a
      fire on the floor at the farther end and pervaded the atmosphere. The ceiling was hung with hundreds of salmon,
      split and drying in the smoke.</p>

    <p>The scene was a strange one. On either side of the room was a row of twelve women standing erect with arms
      crossed and hands extended, with finger tips at the shoulders. They kept time to the drums and their voices by
      balancing on the balls of their feet and tapping with their heels on the floor, while they chanted with varying
      pitch and time. The excitement and persistent repetition wore them out, and I heard that others than Smohalla had
      seen visions in their trances, but I saw none who would admit it or explain anything of it. I fancied they feared
      their own action, and that real death might come to them in this simulated death.</p>

    <p>Those on the right hand were dressed in garments of a red color with an attempt at uniformity. Those on the left
      wore costumes of white buckskin, said to be very ancient ceremonial costumes, with red and blue trimmings. All
      wore large round silver plates or such other glittering ornaments as they possessed. A canvas covered the floor
      and on it knelt the men and boys in lines of seven. Each seven, as a rule, had shirts of the same color. The
      tallest were in front, the size diminishing regularly to the rear. Children and ancient hags filled in any spare
      space. In front on a mattress knelt Smohalla, his left hand covering his heart. On his right was the boy bell
      ringer in similar posture. Smohalla wore a white garment which he was pleased to call a priest’s gown, but it was
      simply a white cloth shirt with a colored stripe down the back.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I and my two assistants were seated on a mattress about 10 feet in front of the prophet, which fortunately placed
      us near the door and incidentally near fresh air. There were two other witnesses, Indians from distant villages,
      who sat at one side with Smohalla’s son looking on.</p>

    <p>Smohalla’s son was said to be in training as his successor. He was a young man, apparently about 23 years old,
      tall, slender, and active in movement, and commonly kept himself apart from the body of the people. He was much
      darker than his father. His dress was brilliant in style and color. He ordinarily wore a short gown or surplice,
      sometimes yellow and at other times sky blue, with ornate decorations of stars or moons appliqué, cut from
      bright-colored cloths. The sleeves were extravagantly trimmed with beads and silver ornaments. He knelt at the
      right of the group as the place of honor. On his left was Coteeakun, the head man of the Indian village at Union
      gap, on the Yakima reservation. The third man was Coteeakun’s brother, a most intelligent and progressive Indian.
      (<i><a href="#MacMurray">MacMurray</a> MS.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>From Charles Ike, an intelligent half-blood interpreter on Yakima reservation, who is also the regular interpreter
    of the Smohalla ritual services at the Yakima village of Paʾkiut, we obtain additional interesting details
    concerning the ceremony as there performed, with the underlying religious teachings.</p>

  <p>As at present taught, the religion finds adherents among probably all the tribes along the Columbia from near the
    British border down to the Wushqûm tribe at The Dalles, with the exception, perhaps, of the Klikatat, who are nearly
    all Catholics. The two chief centers are at Pʿnä or Priest rapids, where Smohalla in person regularly preaches to
    about 120 hearers, and at Paʾkiut, at Union gap on Yakima reservation, where, until his death a short time ago,
    Tianä′ni has regularly conducted the services for about 300 of his tribe. At each place is a church or meeting-house
    built as already described.</p>

  <p>The former high priest of the doctrine among the Yakima, and the right-hand man of Smohalla himself, was
    Kotai′aqan, already mentioned, the son of the great war chief Kamai′äkan. It is even asserted that he was the
    originator of the system. However this may be, it is certain that he had much to do with formulating both the dogmas
    and the ritual. In temper he was more gentle than Smohalla, and more disposed to meet civilization half-way. On his
    death, about 1890, he was succeeded by his stepson, Tīanä′ni, or “Many Wounds,” who filled the office until about
    October, 1892, when he was murdered near his home by two drunken Indians. He was succeeded in the chieftainship by a
    younger son of Kotai′aqan named Sha′awĕ (or Shaw-wawa Kootiacan), and in his priestly functions by a man known to
    the whites as Billy John.</p>

  <p>The regular services take place on Sunday, in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Sunday has been held sacred
    among the Nez Percés and neighboring tribes for more than sixty years, as the result of the teachings of the Hudson
    Bay officers. The prairie tribes also, having learned that Sunday is the great “medicine day” of the whites, now
    select it by preference for their own religious ceremonies of the Ghost dance and the mescal. There are also
    services during the week, besides special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_728">728</span> periodic observances,
    such as the “lament” for the dead, particularly the dead chiefs, in early spring; the salmon dance, when the salmon
    begin to run in April, and the berry dance, when the wild berries ripen in autumn. The description of the ceremonial
    of the salmon dance will answer for the others, as it differs chiefly only by the addition of the feast.</p>

  <p>As already stated, the house has the door at the eastern end, as is the common rule in all Indian structures. On
    the roof, at the eastern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_729">729</span> end of the building at Paʾkiut, are the
    flags, the center one blue, representing the sky; another one white, representing the earthly light, and the third
    yellow, representing the heavenly light of the spirit world. Blue, white, and yellow are the sacred colors of this
    system, as also of that of the Shakers, to be described later. On entering, the worshipers range themselves in two
    lines along the sides of the building, the men and boys standing along the northern wall, the women and girls along
    the southern wall, and all facing toward the center. The first man entering takes his place on the north nearest the
    door; the next one stands just beyond him, and so on; while the women and girls, when their turn comes, make the
    whole circuit along the northern side, and then, turning at the farther end, take their places in reverse order
    along the southern wall. In the open space between the rows is a floor-walker, whose business it is to see that
    everyone is in the right place. All are dressed as nearly as possible in the finest style of the old Indian costume,
    buckskin and shell ornaments, their faces painted yellow, white, or red with Indian paints, and carrying eagle
    feathers in their right hands (plates <a href="#plate_xc"><span class="smcap">xc</span></a>,
    <a href="#plate_xci"><span class="smcap">xci</span></a>; <a href="#fig_66">figure 66</a>).</p>

  </figure>

  <p>At the farther end, facing the door, sits the high priest, while just behind him stands his “interpreter,” and on
    his left are seated on the ground the three drummers with their large drums in front of them. The high priest
    carries a large bell in his left hand and a smaller one in his right.</p>

  <p>Dishes of fresh-cooked salmon and jars of water, together with a plentiful supply of other food, are ranged in
    front of the devotees. After a preliminary ceremony in the nature of a litany, in which the principal articles of
    their theology are recited in the form of question and answer by the whole body of worshipers, the high priest gives
    the command, “Take water,” when everyone raises a cup of water to his lips. Next comes the command, “Now drink,” and
    each one takes a sip. At the words, “Now the salmon,” each takes up a portion of fish, which he puts into his mouth
    at the next command, “Now eat.” Last comes the command, “Now help yourselves,” which is the signal for a general
    attack on the provisions.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_730">730</span></p>

  <p>When everyone has satisfied his hunger, the remains of the feast are cleared away and the “dance” begins. At a
    signal given by a single stroke of the bell in the left hand of the high priest all stand up in line on either side
    of the building. At another stroke of the bell all put their right hands on their breasts. Another tap of the bell
    and the right hand is brought out in front of the body. Another, and they begin to move their right hands backward
    and forward like fans in front of the breast, and thus continue throughout the dance, keeping time also to the
    singing by balancing alternately upon their toes and heels, as already described, without moving from their places.
    Ritual songs are sung throughout the remainder of the service, in time with the movements of the dancers and the
    sounds of the drums, and regulated by the strokes of the bell.</p>

  <p>Between songs anyone who wishes to speak steps out into the open space. With a single tap of the bell the high
    priest then summons his “interpreter,” standing behind him, who comes forward and stands beside the speaker, a few
    feet in front and at the right of the high priest. The speaker then in a low tone tells his story—usually a trance
    vision of the spirit world—to the interpreter, who repeats it in a loud voice to the company. At the end of the
    recital the high priest gives the signal with the bell, when all raise their right hands with a loud “Ai!” (Yes!).
    The high priest himself sometimes discourses also to the people through the interpreter; at other times directly.</p>

  <p>Each song is repeated until the high priest gives the signal with the bell to stop. Most of the songs consist—in
    the native language—of seven lines. At the end of the first line the high priest taps once with the bell; at the end
    of the second line he taps twice, and so on to the end of the song, when he rings the bell hard and continuously,
    and all raise their hands with a loud “Ai!” Then the song leader, who stands with a feather fan between the high
    priest and the drummers, starts the next song.</p>

  <p>The first song is given by all standing motionless, with the right hand on the breast and with eyes cast downward.
    It may be rendered:</p>

  <p>On leaving, at the close of the ceremony, the man nearest the high priest passes around in front of him and down
    along in front of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_731">731</span> line of women, and as he reaches the door
    he turns around and bows to the high priest. Each man in turn thus files around and passes out, after which the
    women—first the one nearest the high priest and then the others in regular order—pass out in the same manner. While
    the worshipers are thus going out, the high priest, standing up, rings continuously the small bell in his right
    hand, while with the larger bell in his left he gives a single stroke as each one passes through the door.</p>

  <h3><i>Tribes of the Columbia region</i></h3>

  <p>The following synopsis will give a good general idea of the location and numbers of the tribes of the Columbia
    region from the British line down to the Cascades, including all those under the influence of the Smohalla religion.
    Except when derived from such well-known authorities as Lewis and Clark, Stevens, Gibbs, etc., the information given
    is the result of personal investigation and work with Yakima and Pälus Indians. The general boundaries of the tribes
    west of the Cascade range, including the adherents of the Shaker religion, are also indicated on the accompanying
    map (<a href="#plate_lxxxviii">plate <span class="smcap">lxxxviii</span></a>), but our information in regard to this region is too meager to be
    definite.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Kutenai</span> (Kitunahan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Arcs Plats, Cotonné, Cottonoi, Coutanie,
    Flatbow, Kitunaha, Kootenai, Koutaine, Kutneha, Skalzi, Tushepaw (Lewis and Clark, 1805), White-tailed Deer People
    (<a href="#Clark">Clark</a>, Indian Sign Language). The Kutenai, properly Kituna′qa, form a distinct linguistic stock, and live chiefly
    on the Canadian side, around Kutenai river and lake, but extend across the line into northern Idaho and northwestern
    Montana. Their extension southward dates from their treaty of peace with the Flatheads about ninety years ago. In
    company with the Flatheads they were accustomed formerly to come down from the mountains in the fall to hunt the
    buffalo on the headwaters of the Missouri. They are mentioned by Lewis and Clark in 1805 under the name of Tushepaw,
    with bands distinguished as Ootlashoot, Micksucksealton (?), and Hohilpo living in the mountains and on Clark’s fork
    within United States territory. According to Gatschet, Tu′shipa is a collective term applied by the Shoshoni to the
    tribes living north of them, including the Nez Percés and others, as well as the Kutenai. A part of the Kutenai
    joined with the Flatheads and Upper Pend d’Oreilles in a treaty with the government in 1855 and are now on Flathead
    (Jocko) reservation in Montana. They are probably all Catholics. Others, living in northern Idaho, have never
    entered into treaty relations, and may be followers of Smohalla. The best estimates for the last fifty years give
    those within the United States a population of from 400 to 450.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Pend d’Oreille</span> (Salishan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Calispel, Coospellar (Lewis and
    Clark), Kahlispelm, Kalispelines, Kalispelusses, Kellespem, Kullas-Palus, Ku′shpĕlu (a Yakima or Pälus form),
    Papshpûn-ʿlĕma or “people of the great fir trees” (Yakima name), Pend d’Oreilles or<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_732">732</span> “ear-rings” (French name), Ponderas. The Pend d’Oreilles held the country along the
    river and lake of the same name, in Idaho and Washington, immediately southwest of the Kutenai. They are commonly
    distinguished as Upper, on the lake, and Lower, on both banks of the river. They are the Coospellar mentioned by
    Lewis and Clark in 1805. They formerly crossed the mountains annually to hunt buffalo on the Missouri. Since 1844
    they and most of the other Salishan tribes of this region have been under the influence of Catholic missionaries.
    The Upper Pend d’Oreilles joined with the Flatheads and Kutenai in a treaty with the government in 1855, and are now
    on Flathead reservation in Montana. Some of the Lower band joined them there in 1887. Others are on the Cœur d’Alêne
    reservation in Idaho, a few are with Moses on the Columbia in Washington, and the rest are still in their original
    country, never having entered into treaty stipulations. The whole tribe numbers about 1,000 souls.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Colville</span> (Salishan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Chaudière (French name), Chualpay, Kettle
    Falls, Quiarlpi or “basket people” (Hale), Schrooyelpi, Schwogelpi, Schwoyelpi, Swielpee, Wheelpoo (Lewis and
    Clark). They originally occupied the country on Colville and Kettle rivers and on both sides of the Columbia from
    Kettle falls down to Spokane river, in Washington, and extending north into British territory to about the lower
    Arrow lake. They are mentioned by Lewis and Clark under the name of Wheelpoo. Kettle falls on the Columbia, within
    their territory, was the great salmon fishing resort for all the tribes of this region, and here, in 1846, was
    established the Catholic mission of Saint Paul. As a result of this missionary work, all of these Salishan tribes,
    excepting the Sanpoil, Nespelim, Mitaui, and a part of the Spokan are now Catholics. In 1854, according to Stevens,
    the original Shwoyelpi were nearly extinct and their places had been filled by Indians from neighboring tribes.
    Without ever having entered into any treaty with the government, they were assigned in 1872 to Colville reservation,
    Washington, which had been set apart for the tribes of that section. They were reported to number 616 in 1870, and
    only 301 in 1892.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Lake</span> or <span class="smcap">Senijextee</span> (Salishan stock).—These owned the country
    on both sides of the Columbia, in Washington, from about Kettle falls northward into British Columbia to the
    vicinity of Arrow lake. They are now on Colville reservation in Washington and number about 350, with perhaps a few
    others across the boundary. They may be identical with the Lahannas of Lewis and Clark.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Spokan</span> (Salishan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Lartielo (Lewis and Clark), Sarlilso (Gibbs),
    Sinhumanish, Sinkoman (Kutenai name), Spokihnish, Spokomish, Zingomenes. They are commonly distinguished as Upper
    Spokan or Sineeguomenah, Middle or Sintootoo, and Lower or Chekisschee (<i>Winans, <a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 1870</i>). Spokan is the
    name given them by the Cœur d’Alênes; Sinkoman is their Kutenai name, while the Lartielo or Sarlilso of Lewis and
    Clark is simply a bad misprint for Sintootoo, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_733">733</span> name of the
    middle band. They are closely connected, linguistically and politically, with the Sanpoil and Nespelim. The lower
    Spokan are now Protestants, the rest are Catholics. They formerly owned the whole basin of Spokane river in
    Washington and extending into Idaho. They are now on Spokane reservation in Washington and the Cœur d’Alêne
    reservation in Idaho, and number in all about 900 or 1,000.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Cœur d’Alêne</span> (Salishan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Pointed Hearts, Qʾma′shpăl or “kamas
    people” (so called by the Yakima), Skeechaway, Skeetsomish (Lewis and Clark), Skitsămŭq (Pälus name), Skitswish,
    Stietshoi. They occupied the lake and river bearing their name in Idaho and the adjacent headwaters of the Spokane.
    A part of this territory they held jointly with the Spokan, whose language they speak. In 1892 they numbered 427, on
    Cœur d’Alêne reservation in Idaho.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sanpoil</span> (Salishan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Hai-ai′nĭma (Yakima name), Hihighenimmo
    (Lewis and Clark), Ipoilq (another Yakima name), Nʾpochle (Stevens), Sans Puelles, Sinapoils, Sinipouals,
    Sinpaivelish, Sinpohellechach, Sinpoilschne, Siur Poils. The name by which this tribe is commonly known is sometimes
    written as a French form Sans Poils, meaning “without bristles,” or “hairless,” but it is more probably an Indian
    word. They occupy the country on Sanpoil river in Washington, now included within Colville reservation, and are
    closely allied with the Nespelim. These two tribes are the most aboriginal in eastern Washington, and adhere
    strictly to their primitive customs and religion. The two tribes are thus described by Winans, the government
    farmer, in 1870:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>They have never received any presents from the government, although they have been frequently asked to do so.
      They seem suspicious of the whites, are the least civilized and most independent of any of the tribes of the
      territory. They are rich in horses and cattle, possessing all the comforts they know how to enjoy, and it appears
      their only fear is that they will be interfered with by the government. They are perfectly contented with their
      condition, and would not accept anything from the government if offered, except a religious instructor and doctor.<p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Some years later they were brought under the reservation system and a change came o’er the spirit of their dream.
    In 1892 we are told officially that “the Sanpuell Indians are the worst people that I have anything to do with....
    They are surly, ignorant, and filthy,” notwithstanding which they still “have the same religious prejudice as the
    Nespelims about receiving aid from the government.” Of the Nespelim the same intelligent witness tells us that “they
    are a peculiar class of Indians, having a religion of their own.” The religion of the two tribes is aboriginal, and
    is similar to the Smohalla doctrine in principle, although not in ceremonial. In 1892 the Sanpoil were estimated at
    300.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Nespelim</span> (Salishan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Inspellum, Sinspeelish. On the north bank of
    the Columbia, in Washington, along Nespelim river and down to the junction of the Okinagan, and on the opposite side
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_734">734</span> the Columbia down to about Grande Coulée. They speak the same
    language as the Sanpoils, and in aboriginal habit, religion, and organization are closely identified with them. They
    are within the limits of Colville reservation and were reported to number only 62 in 1892.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Okanagan</span> (Salishan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Oakinacken, Okinakane, Okiwahkine. They
    occupy the whole basin of Okanagan river in Washington, extending north into British Columbia, and including
    Similkameen river. The Okanagan were an important tribe or confederacy divided into a number of bands, some of which
    have also at times been considered as belonging to the Spokan, while others are commonly recognized as distinct
    tribes. Ross gives them “twelve tribes,” as follows: Skamoynumach, Kewaughtchenunaugh, Pisscow (Piskwaus),
    Incomecane′took, Tsillane (Chelan), Intie′took (Entiatook), Battlelemuleemauch or Meatwho (Mitaui), Inspellum
    (Nespelim), Sinpohellechach (Sanpoil), Sinwhoyelppetook (Colville), Samilkanuigh (Similkameen), and Oakinacken
    (Okanagan). They are now included within the Colville agency, and are Catholics. They were estimated at 340 in 1870
    and reported as numbering 405 in 1892.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Mitaui</span> (Salishan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Battlelemuleemauch, Meatwho, Meshons,
    Meteowwee (Lewis and Clark), Methows, Mithouies. They formerly lived on the west side of the Columbia, including the
    basins of the Methow, Lake Chelan, and Entiatook river. Lewis and Clark met some of them in 1805 below the mouth of
    the Wallawalla. They are closely connected with the Piskwaus and Isle de Pierres. They now reside in Nespelim valley
    on Colville reservation, confederated with the Isle de Pierres under Chief Moses. The two tribes were reported at
    390 in 1892. A few others live in the neighborhood of Kittitas near the Yakima tribe. See <i>Piskwaus</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Isle de Pierre</span> (Salishan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Columbias, Linkinse, Sinkiuse. They
    originally occupied the country in Washington from the Columbia eastward to the Grande Coulée, extending from about
    the mouth of the Grande Coulée down nearly to Crab creek. Isle de Pierre is the French name of Rock island in the
    Columbia at the mouth of the Wenatchee. For a long time, under their noted chief Moses, they refused to recognize
    the authority of the government or to go on a reservation. Now, however, they are settled in Nespelim valley, on
    Colville reservation. They were reported to number 390 in 1892 and are described as “true, genuine Indians in every
    sense of the word.” Their chief, Moses, the enemy and rival of Smohalla, was thus described in 1870: “Moses, the
    head chief, has been a great warrior. He was foremost in the fights of 1858 with Colonels Steptoe and Wright, and
    was severely wounded a number of times, but not dying, the Indians believe he has a charmed life. He is medium
    sized, about 45 years old, noble looking, straight as an arrow, and never breaks his word. He has more influence
    than any other chief east of the Cascade mountains in the territory. He comes nearer being such a chief as we read
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_735">735</span> than any I have ever met. He is kindly disposed toward the
    whites and invites them to come and settle in his country.” (<i>Winans.</i>) Linguistically they are probably
    nearest related to the Piskwaus.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Wa′napûm</span> (Shahaptian stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Columbia River Indians, Sokulks. This is
    the tribe of which Smohalla is the chief and high priest. They are a small band, numbering probably less than 200
    souls, and closely connected linguistically and politically with the Yakima, Pälus, and Nez Percés. Wanapûm is the
    name by which they are known to these cognate tribes, and signifies “river people;” from <i>wana</i> or <i>wala</i>,
    “river” (particularly Columbia river), and <i>pûm</i> or <i>pam</i>, “people or tribal country.” Together with the
    other non-treaty tribes of this region they are known to the whites under the indefinite name of “Columbia River
    Indians.” They are identical with the Sokulk met by Lewis and Clark at the mouth of Snake river and described as
    living farther up on the Columbia. The name Sokulk seems to be entirely unknown among the Yakima and Pälus of today.
    The Wa′napûm range along both banks of the Columbia, in Washington, from above Crab creek down to the mouth of Snake
    river. Their village, where Smohalla resides, is on the west bank of the Columbia, at the foot of Priest rapids, in
    the Yakima country. It is called Pʿnä, signifying “a fish weir,” and is a great rendezvous for the neighboring
    tribes during the salmon fishing season. Haying never made a treaty or gone on a reservation, they are not
    officially recognized by the government.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Pä′lus</span> (Shahaptian stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Palouse, Pelloatpallah Chopunnish (Lewis and
    Clark), Peloose, Polonches, Sewatpalla. The Pälus owned the whole basin of Palouse river in Washington and Idaho,
    and extended also along the north bank of Snake river to its junction with the Columbia. They were, and are, closely
    connected with the Wanapûm and the Nez Percés. Pälus, the name by which the tribe is commonly known, is properly the
    name of Standing Rock, at the junction of Palouse and Snake rivers. They can not explain the meaning. They have four
    villages: Almotu, on the north bank of Snake river in Washington, about 30 miles above the mouth of Palouse river;
    Pälus, on the north bank of Snake river just below the junction of the Palouse; Ta′sawĭks, on the north bank of
    Snake river about 15 miles above its mouth; and Kasĭ′spä or Cosispa (meaning “at the point,” from <i>kăsĭ′s</i>, a
    point, and <i>pä</i>, the locative), at Ainsworth in the junction of the Snake and Columbia. This last village has a
    slight difference in dialect and is sometimes regarded as belonging to the Wanapûm. Although the Pä′lus are
    mentioned as parties to the Yakima treaty of 1855, they have never as a tribe recognized any treaty limitations or
    come upon a reservation. They are aboriginal in their ideas and among the most devoted adherents of the Smohalla
    doctrine. They were estimated at 500 in 1854, but, not being officially recognized, it is impossible to give their
    present number.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_736">736</span></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Pĭskwaus</span> or <span class="smcap">Winä′tshipûm</span> (Salishan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>:
    Piscaous, Piscous, Pisquose. The name by which this tribe is commonly known is properly the name of a fishing place
    on Wenatchee river, and is probably Salishan, but may be from the Yakima <i>pĭsko</i>, signifying “a bend in the
    river.” The Yakima call the river Winätshi, signifying a “river issuing from a cañon,” and the tribe Winätshipûm.
    The Piskwaus proper, on Wenatchee river, with their connected bands or tribes living in the same neighborhood, west
    of the Columbia in Kittitas and Okanogan counties, Washington, are a southern extension of the Mitaui and speak the
    same language. Under the name of Piskwaus, Stevens includes “the Indians on the Columbia between the Priests’ and
    Ross rapids, on the Pisquose or Winatshapam river; the Enteatkeon, Chelaun lake, and the Mithaw on Barrier river.
    The name of Pisquouse, however, properly refers to a single locality on the river known to the Yakamas as
    Winatshapam. The Pisquouse themselves, as has before been remarked, are so much intermarried with the Yakamas that
    they have almost lost their nationality. These bands were formerly all united under one principal chief, Stalkoosum,
    who is said to have been a man of great note among them. He was killed a few years since in a fight with the
    Blackfeet, since which there has been no head of the tribe.” (<i>Stevens, Comr. Rept., 1854.</i>) The Piskwaus and
    smaller connected tribes took part in the Yakima treaty of 1855, but do not live on the reservation. Most of them
    live on the Wenatchee and the north branch of Yakima river in Kittitas county. They are all Catholics. There is no
    official statement of their number. Smaller tribes or bands connected with the Piskwaus proper and speaking the same
    language are:</p>

  <p>1. <span class="smcap">K̔′tătäs</span>, K̔tătäs-‛lĕ′ma, Ketetas (Stevens), Pshwa′năpûm (Yakima name), Shanwappoms
    (Lewis and Clark). K̔′tătäs signifies “a shoal,” <i>‘lĕ′ma</i> being a tribal suffix, and Pshwană-pûm in the Yakima
    language signifies “shoal people,” the name referring to a shoal in Yakima river at Ellensburg.</p>

  <p>2. <span class="smcap">Ska′utăl</span>, or Skaddal (of Lewis and Clark). About Boston creek and Kahchass lake, at
    the head of Yakima river.</p>

  <p>3. <span class="smcap">W‛shä′nătu</span>, or Shallattoos (of Lewis and Clark). The word means “huckleberry” in
    Yakima, and is applied to a site on Yakima river just above Ellensburg.</p>

  <p>4. <span class="smcap">Skwa′nănă</span>, or Squannaroos (of Lewis and Clark). A Yakima word meaning “whirlpool,”
    and applied to a point on Yakima river about opposite the entrance of Selah creek, the village being on the west
    bank of the river. This band may possibly speak the language of the Ätanûm, a Shahaptian tribe, whose territory
    adjoins them.</p>

  <p>5. <span class="smcap">Qamĭl-‘lĕma</span> or Kahmiltpah. The name is Yakima, and signifies “people of Qamĭ′lh.”
    Qamĭ′lh, or “Watching for Fish,” was a chief who formerly lived with his band about Saddle mountain, on the east
    side of the Columbia, above Priest rapids. They are called Kahmiltpah in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_737">737</span>
    the Yakima treaty of 1855. They now live with the other tribes last named in Kittitas county.</p>

  <p>6. <span class="smcap">Si′ăpkat</span> or Seapcat. They reside now in Kittitas county, but probably lived
    originally at a place of the same name on the east bank of the Columbia, about Bishop rock and Milk creek, below
    Wenatchee river. They are called Seapcat in the Yakima treaty of 1855. The word is of the Piskwaus language.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Yä′kĭmâ</span> (Shahaptian stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Cutsahnim (Lewis and Clark), Eyackimah,
    Pa′‛kiut-‛lĕ′ma, Stobshaddat (by Puget sound tribes, <i>Tolmie</i>), Waptai′lmĭm, Yackamans, Yookoomans. The Yakima
    are the most important tribe of the Shahaptian stock, excluding the Nez Percés. They occupied the country of
    Natchess and middle Yakima rivers, in the present Yakima county, Washington, and are now on a reservation within the
    same county. Stevens says the name signifies “black bear” in the Wallawalla language, but Yakima informants state
    that it is a nickname signifying “coward” or “runaway,” and say that the proper name of the tribe is Waptai′lmĭm,
    people of the “narrow river,” or Pa′‛kiut-‛lĕ′ma, “people of the gap,” both names referring to the narrows in Yakima
    river at Union gap, near Yakima bridge. Their old village was on the west side of the river, just below the gap.
    They are the Cutsahnim of Lewis and Clark. This name may possibly come from the same root as Kû′tsano′t, “Lying
    Alongside,” the name of an old Yakima chief who died about 1880. In 1854, according to Stevens, they were “divided
    into two principal bands, each made up of a number of villages and very closely connected, the one owning the
    country on the Natchess and lower Yakima, the other on the Wenass and its main branch above the forks.” These
    latter, however, were chiefly of the Piskwaus connection. They had then several chiefs, of whom Kamaiakan was the
    most important. Like all the other Columbia tribes east of the Cascade range, they formerly crossed the Rocky
    mountains annually to hunt the buffalo on the waters of the Missouri. In 1855 the government made a treaty with the
    Yakima, Piskwaus, Pälus, and other tribes by which they were to cede a territory on both sides of the Columbia,
    extending generally from the Cascade range eastward to Palouse and Snake rivers, and southward from above Chelan
    lake to the Columbia, excepting a small portion between the Columbia and the lower Yakima. At the same time the
    Yakima reservation was established and an arrangement was made by which all the tribes and bands concerned were to
    be confederated under the title of the “Yakama Nation,” with Kamaiakan as head chief. Shortly afterward the Yakima
    war broke out, and the treaty remained unratified until 1859. As already stated, the Pälus and several other tribes
    have never recognized it or come on the reservation, and their objection to such removal has become a religious
    principle of the Smohalla doctrine. In the original treaty of 1855 fourteen tribes are named as participating, as
    follows: Yakama (Yäkima), Palouse (Pä′lus), Pisquouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_738">738</span>
    (Pi′skwaus), Wenatshapam (another name for Piskwaus), Klikatat (Klûkatät), Klinquit (not identified), Kowwassayee
    (K′kasawi), Liaywas (not identified), Skinpah (Skinpä), Wish-ham (Wushqûm), Shyiks (not identified), Ochechotes
    (Uchi′chol), Kahmiltpah (Qamil′lĕma), and Seapcat (Si′apkat). Among these were represented at least six languages
    and three linguistic stocks. The majority of these Indians west of the Columbia, including the Yakima proper and
    others on the reservation, are Catholics, with also a number of adherents of the Shaker and Smohalla doctrines.
    Those on the reservation numbered 1,200 in 1892, with an estimated 1,500 outside the boundaries. Beside the
    principal band of Yakima, the Waptailmĭm already mentioned, there are also the Sĕ′tăs-‛lĕma, or “people of the rye
    prairie,” on Setass creek, a western tributary of the Yakima in the eastern part of the reservation, and the Pĭsko,
    or people of the “river bend,” in a village also on the south side of the Yakima, between Topinish and Setass
    creeks. (See <a href="#Pishquitpah"><i>Pishquitpah</i></a>.) Their dialects are said to differ slightly from that of the Waptailmĭm.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Ä′tănûm-‛lĕma</span> (Shahaptian stock) or “people (<i>‛lĕma</i>) of Ätanûm creek.”—A small
    tribe on Atahnam creek, in Yakima county, Washington, on the northern boundary of the reservation. They are said to
    speak a language distinct from Yakima or Klûkatät, but cognate. They have no official recognition now or in the
    treaty of 1855. The name Ä′tănûm is Yakima, and refers to a stream “ascended” (by salmon).</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Klû’kătät</span> (Shahaptian stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Clickahut, Clickitat, Klikatat,
    Qwû′lh-hwai-pûm, Weyehhoo, Whulwhypum. The name by which this tribe is commonly known is from the Wasko language and
    signifies “beyond (the mountain)”—that is, east of the Cascade range—with reference to the Chinookan tribes on the
    lower Columbia. The same name was also at times extended to the Yakima. They call themselves Qwûlh-hwai-pûm,
    “prairie people;” from <i>qwûlh-hwai</i>, “prairie,” and <i>pûm</i>, “people,” referring particularly to their
    occupancy of Camass prairie. They formerly occupied the southern slopes of Mount Adams and Mount Helens, with the
    country of Klikatat and Lewis rivers, in the present Klickitat and Skamania counties, Washington. East of them were
    the Yakima and west were the Salishan and Chinookan tribes. At one time they lived farther east, but were driven
    west by the Cayuse. (<i>Stevens.</i>) About sixty years ago they crossed the Columbia and overran the Willamet
    country, and even penetrated as far south as the Umpqua, but afterward withdrew again to their proper country.
    Although but a small tribe, they were aggressive and enterprising and were the trade medium between the tribes west
    of the mountains and those east. They joined in the Yakima treaty of 1855 and are now chiefly on Yakima reservation,
    but a few are still on White Salmon river, in Klickitat county. Their number is unknown. The Taitinapam and Topinish
    speak the same language and may be considered as branches of this tribe.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_739">739</span></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Qa′pnĭsh-‛lĕma</span> or <span class="smcap">Topinish</span> (Shahaptian stock).—A small tribe
    on Topinish river in Yakima county, Washington, within the present limits of the reservation. They speak the
    Klûkatät language. The name signifies “people (<i>‛lĕma</i>) of the trail coming from the foot of the hill.”</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Taitinapam</span> (Shahaptian stock).—<i>Synonym</i>: Tai-kie-a-pain (misprint). A small tribe
    speaking the Klûkatät language, formerly living on the western slopes of the Cascade mountains, between the heads of
    Lewis and Cowlitz rivers, in Skamania county, Washington, being the westernmost tribe of Shahaptian stock. If any
    are left, they are probably incorporated with the Klûkatät on Yakima reservation. They never had official
    recognition.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Chämnä′pûm</span> (Shahaptian stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Chimnahpum, Chimnapoos, Cuimnapum. A
    tribe which occupied the bend of the Columbia below Yakima river, together with the country on the lower Yakima,
    chiefly in the present Yakima county, Washington. They are the Chimnahpum of Lewis and Clark, and speak a dialect of
    the language of the Pä′lus and Wanapûm, with which tribes the few survivors are incorporated. A few are also still
    living on the west side of the Columbia, opposite Pasco. The name is of their own language and means “people
    (<i>pûm</i>) of Chämnä′,” their old village about opposite Wallula.</p>

  <p id="Pishquitpah"><span class="smcap">Pishquitpah</span> (Shahaptian stock).—This name occurs only in the narrative of Lewis and
    Clark as that of a tribe in 1805, “residing at the Muscleshell rapid and on the north side of the Columbia to the
    commencement of the high country, wintering on the borders of the Tapteal.” The Tapteal (properly Waptail or
    Waptailmĭm) is Yakima river. This would locate them in eastern Klickitat and Yakima counties, Washington. They are
    probably identical with the Pĭsko band of the Yakima. In the name Pishquitpah the final <i>pah</i> is the Yakima or
    Pä′lus locative <i>pä</i>, “at.”</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">K̔ka′săwi</span> or <span class="smcap">Kowwassayee</span> (Shahaptian stock).—A small tribe
    speaking the Tenino language and formerly occupying a village of the same name, K̔ka′săwi, on the north bank of the
    Columbia, in Klickitat county, Washington, about opposite the mouth of the Umatilla. The full name is
    K̔ka′săwi-‛lĕ′ma, “people (<i>‛lĕma</i>) of the arrow-making place,” the local form being from <i>k̔ka′so</i>,
    “arrow.” They took part in the Yakima treaty of 1855 under the name of Kowwassayee, and are now on Yakima
    reservation.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Hăhau′pûm</span> or <span class="smcap">Wahowpum</span> (Shahaptian stock).—A small tribe
    speaking the Tenino language and occupying a village, Hăha′u, on the north bank of the Columbia, about the mouth of
    Olive creek, in Klickitat county, Washington. The word means “willow people,” from <i>hăha′u</i>, a species of
    willow, and <i>pûm</i>, “people.” They are the Wahowpum of Lewis and Clark. They have never had official
    recognition.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_740">740</span></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Uchi′chol</span> or <span class="smcap">Ochechotes</span> (Shahaptian stock).—A small tribe
    speaking the Tenino language, living now, or formerly, on the north bank of the Columbia in Klickitat county,
    Washington. They are mentioned as Ochechotes in the Yakima treaty of 1855, and may now be incorporated with other
    tribes on Yakima reservation. The name, from the Tenino language, signifies the “hind dorsal-fin” (of a salmon), and
    is the name of a rock on the north side of the Columbia, opposite the upper end of the island, at the mouth of the
    Des Chutes. See <i>Tapänäsh</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Skĭ′npä</span> (Shahaptian stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Sawpaw (?), Skien, Skin, Skinpah. A small
    tribe speaking the Tenino language and formerly having a village on the north bank of the Columbia in Klickitat
    county, Washington, at the falls opposite Celilo. They took part in the Yakima treaty of 1855 under the name of
    Skinpah, and are now incorporated with the other tribes on Yakima reservation. The name is Tenino, and means “cradle
    place,” or “at the cradle,” from <i>skĭn</i>, “cradle,” and <i>pä</i>, the locative, and refers to a prominent rock
    at the site of their former village having some resemblance to an Indian cradle. See <i>Tapänäsh</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Täpanä′sh</span> or <span class="smcap">Eneeshur</span> (Shahaptian stock).—A small tribe
    speaking the Tenino language, having a village on the north bank of the Columbia in Klickitat county, Washington,
    about opposite the mouth of Des Chutes river and a little above Celilo. The name is identical with the Eneeshur of
    Lewis and Clark, these explorers in 1805 having also included under this name the various bands speaking the Tenino
    language on both sides of the Columbia about the mouth of the Des Chutes. The Tapänäsh have no official recognition.
    See <i>Tenino</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Tlaqluit</span> or <span class="smcap">Wŭshqûm</span> (Chinookan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>:
    Echebool, Echeloot, Eloot, Helwit, Niculuita, Ouichram, Tchilouit, Tilhulhwit, Wisham, Wishham, Wishram, Wisswham.
    The Tlaqluit, with the Wasko, are the easternmost tribes of Chinookan stock on the Columbia, having immediately
    above them the Shahaptian tribes, speaking the Tenino language. The Tlaqluit territory lies along the north bank of
    the Columbia in Klickitat county, Washington, from Tenino, about 6 miles above The Dalles, down to the neighborhood
    of White Salmon river. They call themselves Tlaqluit (Echeloot of Lewis and Clark), and are called Wŭshqûmă-pûm, or
    “Wŭshqûm people,” by the tribes speaking the Tenino language, Wŭshqûm being the name of their chief village near
    South Side at The Dalles, the great fishing and trading resort for the tribes of this section. The name appears also
    as Wishram. Both Tlaqluit and Wŭshqûm refer to a species of louse or flea abounding in that neighborhood. They took
    part in the Yakima treaty of 1855 under the name of Wishham, but most of them have probably never gone on the
    reservation. See <i>Wasko</i>.</p>

  <p>There is a tradition in the tribe that long before the coming of the whites to the Columbia a band of Tlaqluit left
    their people on account of a petty quarrel as to whether a goose made a certain noise with its<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_741">741</span> bill or with its wings, and went up the Columbia and the Spokane, and are supposed
    to be now about the headwaters of the latter stream and still retaining their language, although under a different
    tribal name.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Chilû′ktkwa</span> or <span class="smcap">Chilluckittequaws</span> (Chinookan stock).—A tribe
    formerly extending along the north bank of the Columbia in Klickitat and Skamania counties, Washington, from about
    White Salmon river down to some distance below the Cascades. They are called Chilluckittequaws in 1805 by Lewis and
    Clark, who speak also of a separate band of the same tribe under the name of Smackshop, a name which can not now be
    identified. The tribe now numbers less than 100. Until recently the remnant lived about the mouth of White Salmon
    river, but removed about thirteen years ago to the Cascades. Their language is nearly the same as that of the Wasko.
    They have never had official recognition.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Kwikwû′lĭt</span> or <span class="smcap">Dog River</span> (Chinookan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>:
    Cascade Indians, Kigaltwalla, Upper Chinook, Wahclellah, Watlala. A small tribe formerly living at the Cascades and
    about Dog river, a small stream coming into the Columbia about half-way between the Cascades and The Dalles, in
    Wasco county, Oregon. They are identical, in part at least, with the Wahclellahs of Lewis and Clark (mentioned as a
    part of the “Shahala nation”), and are the “Ki-gal-twal-la band of the Wascoes” and the “Dog River band of the
    Wascoes” of the Wasco treaty of 1855. The “Dog River or Cascade Indians” were reported to number 80 souls in 1854.
    In the next year they, with other tribes, entered into the Wasco treaty, by which they agreed to remove to
    Warmspring reservation, where some of them now are, while the others are still about the Cascades. Their language is
    nearly the same as that of the Wasko.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Wasko</span> (Chinookan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Dalles Indians, Wascopum. A tribe formerly
    claiming the country about The Dalles, on the south bank of the Columbia, in Wasco county, Oregon. They, with the
    Tlaqluit on the opposite bank, are the easternmost extension of the Chinookan stock, and speak the same language.
    The name is said to be a Tenino word, meaning “grass,” or “grass people.” It has sometimes been made to include
    several cognate bands about The Dalles and Cascades, on both sides of the Columbia. Under the name of “The Dalles
    band of the Wascoes,” they entered into the Wasco treaty of 1855, and are now on Warmspring reservation in Oregon.
    They numbered 260 in 1892.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Waiäm</span> (Shahaptian stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: (Lower) Des Chutes, Waiäm-‛lĕma, Wayyampa,
    Wyam. A tribe speaking the Tenino language and formerly living about the mouth of Des Chutes river, in the present
    Wasco and Sherman counties, Oregon. Their chief village was on the Columbia where Celilo now is, and was called
    Waiäm, whence their name of Waiäm-‛lĕma or “people of Waiäm.” They joined in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_742">742</span>
    the Wasco treaty of 1855 under the name of “Wyam or Lower Des Chutes band of Walla-Wallas,” and are
    now on Warmspring reservation in Oregon. Their number is not separately reported.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Tai′-ăq</span> (Shahaptian stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Taigh, Ta-ih, Tairtla, Tyich. A tribe
    speaking the Tenino language and formerly occupying the country about Tygh and White rivers, in Wasco county,
    Oregon. The name Tai′-ăq refers to the stream and denotes “muddy, white water.” They took part in the Wasco treaty
    of 1855 under the name of “Ta-ih or Upper Des Chutes band of Walla-Wallas,” and are now on Warmspring reservation,
    Oregon. Their number is not reported.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Tĭ‛lqûni</span> (Shahaptian stock).—A tribe formerly claiming the country between Tygh valley
    and Warmspring river, west of Des Chutes river, in the present Wasco county, Oregon. They are now on Warmspring
    reservation, in the same neighborhood. They have never been officially mentioned under their Indian name, and may be
    considered the Warmspring proper, although this name is local rather than tribal. They speak the Tenino language.
    See <i>Tenino</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Tenino</span> or <span class="smcap">Mĕli′-‛lĕma</span> (Shahaptian stock).—The most important
    Shahaptian tribe of western Oregon. They formerly occupied middle Des Chutes river, and conquered the present
    Warmspring reservation from the Paiute or Snake tribes, but never occupied it until put there by the Wasco treaty of
    1855. Since then they have been known indiscriminately as Tenino or Warmspring Indians, although this latter
    designation is commonly used to include other cognate tribes on the same reservation. For this reason it is
    impossible to give their number definitely. The Tenino language, in various dialects, is spoken, excepting by the
    Lohim, by all the tribes formerly living on both banks of the Columbia and on its tributaries from the country of
    the Wasko about The Dalles up to about the mouth of the Umatilla.</p>

  <p>Most of this region, on the south or Oregon side of the Columbia, was formerly held by Shoshonean tribes of Paiute
    connection, which have been dispossessed by the Shahaptian tribes and driven farther back to the south. The only
    Shoshonean tribe which maintained its place on the Columbia was the Lohim, on Willow creek. The Tenino themselves
    conquered the present Warmspring reservation from the Snakes. The expulsion was in full progress when Lewis and
    Clark went down the Columbia in 1805, but had been practically completed when the first treaties were made with
    these tribes fifty years later. Lewis and Clark state that “on that (the south) side of the river none of the tribes
    have any permanent habitations, and on inquiry we were confirmed in our belief that it was from the fear of being
    attacked by the Snake Indians, with whom they are constantly at war. This nation they represent as being very
    numerous and residing in a great number of villages on the Towahnahiook (Wanwaui or Des Chutes), where they live
    principally on salmon, ... the first villages of the Snake Indians being twelve days’ journey on a course about
    southeast of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_743">743</span> place.” In the appendix, after mentioning
    various bands of Snakes on Snake and Willamette rivers, they speak of the main body as “residing in the fall and
    winter on the Multnomah (Willamet) river, southward of the Southwest mountains, and in spring and summer near the
    heads of the Towahnahiook (Des Chutes), Lepage (John Day), Yaumalolam (Umatilla), and Wollawollah rivers, and
    especially at the falls of the Towahnahiook, for the purpose of fishing.” In the Wasco treaty of 1855 the Shahaptian
    tribes were recognized as owners of the whole country southward to the forty-fourth parallel, from the Cascade range
    east to the Blue mountains. See <i>Tapänäsh</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Tûkspû′sh</span> or <span class="smcap">John Day Indians</span> (Shahaptian
    stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Dock-spus, John Day Rivers, Tûkspûsh-‛lĕma. A tribe speaking the Tenino language and
    formerly living along the lower part of John Day river, Oregon, having their principal village at the falls about 4
    miles above the mouth. They are now on Warmspring reservation, and numbered 59 in 1892, with perhaps others off the
    reservation. Tûkspûsh is the name of John Day river in the Tenino language.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Lohĭm</span> or <span class="smcap">Willow Creek Indians</span> (Shoshonean stock).—A tribe
    living on Willow creek, in Gilliam and Morrow counties, Oregon. They are of Shoshonean connection, being the only
    Indians of this stock who have been able to maintain their position on the Columbia against the inroads of the
    Shahaptian tribes. They have never made a treaty with the government, and are generally spoken of as renegades
    belonging to the Umatilla reservation. In 1870 they were reported to number 114, but are not mentioned in the recent
    official reports.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Cayuse</span> or <span class="smcap">Wailĕ′tpu</span> (Waiilatpuan stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>:
    Cailloux, Kayuse, Shiwanish, Skyuse, Wailetma, Yeletpo Chopunnish (of Lewis and Clark). The Cayuse are a warlike
    tribe of distinct stock formerly occupying the mountain country on the heads of Wallawalla, Umatilla, and Grande
    Ronde rivers in Oregon and Washington, including the present Umatilla reservation. Further investigation may yet
    establish a linguistic connection with the Shahaptian tribes. The Molala, formerly on Molalla creek, west of the
    Cascades, are a separated band, of whose western migration the Cayuse and their neighbors still have a tradition.
    The Cayuse formerly bore a high reputation for intelligence and bravery, but on account of their fighting
    propensities, which led them to make constant war on the Snakes and other tribes to the west, they were never very
    numerous. In 1838 a Presbyterian mission, called Waiilatpu, had been established among the Cayuse, by Dr Whitman,
    where now is the town of Whitman, in Wallawalla county, Washington. In 1847 the smallpox, before unknown among them,
    carried off a large part of the tribe. The Cayuse, believing that the missionaries were the cause of it, attacked
    the mission on November 29, 1847, killed Dr Whitman and thirteen others, and destroyed the mission. As a matter of
    fact, there seems little question that the infection was brought into the country in supplies intended for the use
    of the mission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_744">744</span> or of emigrants temporarily stopping there. In
    1854, according to Stevens, “the tribe, though still dreaded by their neighbors on account of their courage and
    warlike spirit, is but a small one, numbering, according to the census of 1851, only 126. Of these, individuals of
    the pure blood are few, the majority being intermixed with the Nez Percés and the Wallah-Wallahs, particularly with
    the former, to such a degree that their own language has fallen into disuse.” A few years ago only a few
    individuals, then living on Umatilla reservation, retained their old language. In 1855 they joined in the treaty by
    which Umatilla reservation in Oregon was set apart, and most of those remaining are now there, while a few others
    are with the Nez Percés at Lapwai. Joseph, the noted Nez Percé chief, is himself the son of a Cayuse father. In 1892
    the Cayuse on Umatilla reservation were reported to number 391, but it is evident that most of these are
    mixed-bloods of other tribes, particularly the Umatilla. The name Cayuse is from the Nez Percé language. They call
    themselves Wailĕtpu. They are known to the Yakima as Wi′alĕt-pûm or Wai′lĕtma, and to the Tenino as Shiwanish, or
    “strangers from up the river,” a name extended also to the Nez Percés.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Umatilla</span> (Shahaptian stock).—<i>Synonym</i>: Utilla. A tribe formerly occupying the
    lower portion of the river of the same name, with the adjacent bank of the Columbia, in Oregon. They speak a
    distinct language of the Shahaptian stock. By the treaty of 1855 they agreed to go on Umatilla reservation in
    Oregon, where in 1892 they were reported to number 216. A large proportion of those now called Cayuse on the same
    reservation are Umatilla mixed-bloods.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Wallawalla</span> (Shahaptian stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>: Oualla-Oualla, Walawaltz, Wollawollah,
    Wollaw-Wollah. A tribe formerly occupying the country about the lower portion of the river of the same name and
    along the east bank of the Columbia from Snake river down nearly to the Umatilla, in Washington and Oregon. They
    take their name from the river, the word being said to refer to “rushing water.” Their language is said to resemble
    closely that of the Nez Percés. By the treaty of 1855 they agreed to go on Umatilla reservation, Oregon, where, in
    1892, they were reported to number 474.</p>

  <p>A small band of the same tribe, known to the Yakima as Walu′la-pûm, formerly lived on the west bank of the Columbia
    opposite the present Wallula. Their dialect is said to have been more akin to the Pä′lus language.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sahaptin</span> or <span class="smcap">Nez Percés</span> (Shahaptian stock).—<i>Synonyms</i>:
    Chohoptins, Chopunnish (Lewis and Clark), Copunnish, Laaptin (misprint), Â′dal-k̔ato′igo, “people with hair cut
    across the forehead” (Kiowa name), Shi′wanĭsh (Tenino name, applied also to the Cayuse), Wa′pamĕtănt (Yakima name
    for the language). The Nez Percés are said to call themselves Sahaptin, and were named Nez Percés, or “pierced
    noses,” by the French from their former custom of wearing nose pendants. They are the most important tribe of the
    Shahaptian stock, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_745">745</span> formerly occupied a large territory in
    eastern Washington and Oregon and central Idaho, bounded on the east by the main divide of the Bitterroot mountains,
    and including lower Grande Ronde and Salmon rivers, with a large part of the Snake and all of the Clearwater. The
    Wallowa valley, the disputed title to which led to the Nez Percé war, lies on a branch of the Grande Ronde, in
    Oregon. They had the Salishan tribes to the northeast, the Shoshonean tribes to the south, and the Cayuse,
    Wallawalla, and Pälus, with all of whom they are much intermarried, on the west and northwest. Almost all
    authorities give them a high character for bravery, intelligence, and honorable conduct traits which were strikingly
    displayed in the Nez Percé war.</p>

  <p>Lewis and Clark traversed their country in 1805, and speak of them and some connected tribes under the name of
    Chopunnish, distinguished as follows: Chopunnish nation (about the present Lapwai reservation), Pelloatpallah band
    (the Pälus), Kimooenim band (on Snake river, between the Salmon and the Clearwater), Yeletpo band (the Cayuse),
    Willewah band (in Wallowa valley, afterward Joseph’s band), Soyennom band (on the north side of the upper
    Clearwater, in Idaho; these were really a part of the Pälus—the proper form is Tätqu′nma, whence Thatuna hills,
    referring to “a fawn” in the Pälus language, and was the name applied to their kamas ground about Camass creek),
    Chopunnish of Lewis river (on Snake river, below the Clearwater). In response to a request from the Nez Percés, who
    sent a delegation all the way to Saint Louis for that purpose in 1832, the first Protestant mission was established
    among them at Lapwai, Idaho, in 1837. Soon afterward they entered into relations with the government, and made their
    first treaty with the United States in 1855. By this treaty they ceded the greater portion of their territory, and
    were confirmed in the possession of a reservation including Wallowa valley. On the discovery of gold in the country,
    however, the miners rushed in, and in consequence a new treaty was made in 1863, by which they gave up all but the
    present Lapwai reservation in Idaho. Joseph, who occupied Wallowa valley with his band, refused to recognize this
    treaty or remove to Lapwai. This refusal finally led to the Nez Percé war in 1877, as already related. The main body
    of the tribe took no part in the war. After the surrender of Joseph his band was removed to Indian Territory, where
    the mortality among them was so great that in 1884 they were returned to the northwest. For several reasons,
    however, it was deemed unadvisable to settle them in the neighborhood of their old home, and a place was finally
    found for them in 1887 on Colville reservation in northern Washington. In 1892 there were 1,828 on Lapwai
    reservation and 138 on Colville reservation, a total population of 1,966.</p>

      THE SHAKERS OF PUGET SOUND</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subhead">
    <p>My breath was out and I died. All at once I saw a great shining light. Angels told me to look back. I did, and
      saw my own body lying dead. It had no soul. My soul left my body and went up to the judgment place of God.... My
      soul was told that I must come back and live on earth. When I came back, I told my friends, “There is a God. My
      good friends, be Christians. If you all try hard and help me, we shall be better men on earth.”—<i>John
      Slocum.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>In 1881 there originated among the tribes of Puget sound in Washington a new religion, which, although apparently
    not founded on any doctrinal prophecy, yet deserves special attention for the prominent part which hypnotism holds
    in its ceremonial. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that the Paiute messiah himself, and through him all the
    apostles of the Ghost dance, have obtained their knowledge of hypnotic secrets from the “Shakers” of Puget sound.</p>

    <img class="figbox" src="images/fig67.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 67</span>—John Slocum and Louis Yowaluch.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The founder of the religion is Squ-sacht-un, known, to the whites as John Slocum. He is now (1896) about 58 years
    of age. His chief high priest is Louis Yowaluch, or Ai-yäl as he is called by the Yakima. Both are of the Squaxin
    tribe. In 1881 (Eells makes it 1882) he “died” or fell into a trance one morning about daylight and remained in that
    condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_747">747</span> until the middle of the afternoon, when he awoke and
    announced that he had been to heaven, but had been met at the entrance by angels, who forbade him to enter on
    account of his wickedness, and gave him his choice either to go to hell or return to earth and teach his people what
    they must do to get to heaven. Accordingly, he came back to earth and began his divinely appointed mission,
    introducing into the new doctrine and ritual a great deal of what he had learned from the white missionaries. From
    the nervous twitchings which so peculiarly distinguished them, his followers soon became known as “Shakers.”
    Although strongly opposed by the agent, who arrested and imprisoned the leaders and visited various minor penalties
    on their followers, the Shaker religion grew and flourished until it now has a regular organization with several
    houses of worship, and has received the official indorsement of the Presbyterian church.</p>

  <p>The following account of the system, in response to a letter of inquiry, was obtained from the missionary, Reverend
    Myron Eells, brother of the agent:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A curious phase of religion sprang up in the fall of 1882 among some of the Indians on the southern part of Puget
      sound. It has prevailed mainly among the Squaxon, Nisqually, Skokomish, and Chehalis Indians, and has been called
      by its opponents the “Shake religion,” and its followers have been called “Shakers” on account of a large amount
      of nervous shaking which is a part of the form of its observance. It is evidently based upon about the same
      principles of the mind as the jerks and shouting at camp meetings among the whites of the southern and western
      states fifty years ago, when they were more ignorant and less acquainted with real religion than they are now.
      When superstition, ignorance, dreams, imagination, and religion are all mingled together, either among whites,
      Indians, or people of any other race, they produce a strange compound. It has proven so in this case.</p>

    <p>In the fall of 1882 an Indian named John Slocum, who was living on Skookum bay, in Mason county, apparently died.
      Some years previous he had lived on the Skokomish reservation, where he had attended a Protestant church, and had
      learned something of the white man’s religion, God, Jesus Christ, and the morals inculcated. He had also learned
      something in his early life of the Catholic religion and its forms and ceremonies. Many Indians were present when
      he was sick and apparently died. They said his neck was broken, and that he remained dead for about six hours,
      when he returned to life, jumped up, and ran off a short distance, and soon began to converse with the people.
      Whether or not it was a case of suspended animation is a question. A white man, a near neighbor of his, who saw
      him before his apparent death, while he thus lay, and after his resuscitation, said he believed the Indian was
      “playing possum.” But the Indians believed that he really died and rose again.</p>

    <p>The Indian stated that he died and attempted to go to heaven, but could not enter it because he was so wicked. He
      was there told, however, the way of life, and that he must return to this earth and teach his people the way, and
      induce them to become Christians. He gained a small band of followers, a church was built for him, and he steadily
      preached to the people.</p>

    <p>Affairs went on this way until the next August. Then, after consultation with other Indians who favored him,
      especially on the Skokomish reservation, it was decided to hold a big meeting. The Indians of the surrounding
      region were called to go. They were told that they would be lost if they did not; that four women would be turned
      into angels; that persons would die and be raised to life again, and that other wonderful things would be done.<p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_748">748</span></p>

    <p>Many went, about half of those on the Skokomish reservation being among the number, and they did hold a big
      meeting. Women did go around trying to fly like angels; four persons are said to have died, and, with the power
      which was said to have been given them from above, others were said to have brought them back to life again. This
      was a mixture of trying to perform miracles, as in Bible times, to prove the divinity of their religion, and some
      of the ceremonies of their old black <i>tomahnous</i>. This was a secret society of their savage days, in which
      persons went into a hypnotic condition, in which they became very rigid, and out of which they came in the course
      of time. The followers of this new religion dreamed dreams, saw visions, went through some disgusting ceremonies a
      la mode the black <i>tomahnous</i>, and were taken with a kind of shaking. With their arms at full length, their
      hands and arms would shake so fast that a common person not under the excitement could hardly shake half as fast.
      Gazing into the heavens, their heads would also shake very fast, sometimes for a few minutes and sometimes for
      hours, or half the night. They would also brush each other with their hands, as they said, to brush off their
      sins, for they said they were much worse than white people, the latter being bad only in their hearts, while the
      Indians were so bad that the badness came to the surface of their bodies and the ends of their finger nails, so
      that it could be picked off. They sometimes brushed each other lightly, and sometimes so roughly that the person
      brushed was made black for a week, or even sick.</p>

    <p>In connection with this they held church services, prayed to God, believed in Christ as a savior, said much about
      his death, and used the cross, their services being a combination of Protestant and Catholic services, though at
      first they almost totally rejected the Bible, for they said they had direct revelations from Christ, and were more
      fortunate than the whites, who had an old, antiquated book.</p>

    <p>After having kept up this meeting for about a week, they disbanded and went to their homes, but did not stop
      their shaking or services. They sometimes held meetings from 6 oclock in the evening until about midnight,
      lighting candles and putting them on their heads for a long time. They became very peculiar about making the sign
      of the cross many times a day, when they began to eat as they asked a blessing, and when they finished their meal
      and returned thanks; when they shook hands with anyone—and they shook hands very often—when they went to church
      and prayer meeting on Thursday evening, and at many other times, far more often than the Catholics do.</p>

    <p>On the Skokomish reservation their indiscretions caused the death of a mother and her child, and an additional
      loss of time and property to the amount of $600 or $800 in a few weeks. It also became a serious question whether
      the constant shaking of their heads would not make some of them crazy, and from symptoms and indications it was
      the opinion of the agency physician, J. T. Martin, that it would do so. Accordingly, on the reservation the
      authority of the agent was brought to bear, and to a great extent the shaking was stopped, though they were
      encouraged to keep on in the practice of some good habits which they had begun, of ceasing gambling, intemperance,
      their old style incantations over the sick, and the like. Some at first said they could not stop shaking, but that
      at their prayer meetings and church services on the Sabbath their hands and heads would continue to shake in spite
      of themselves; but after a short time, when the excitement had died away, they found that they could stop.</p>

    <p>But about Skookum bay, Mud bay, and Squaxon the shaking continued, and it spread to the Nisqually and Chehalis
      Indians. It seemed to be as catching, to use the expression of the Indians, as the measles. Many who at first
      ridiculed it and fought against it, and invoked the aid of the agent to stop it, were drawn into it after a
      little, and then they became its strong upholders. This was especially true of the medicine-men, or Indian
      doctors, and those who had the strongest faith in them. The Shakers declared that all the old Indian religion, and
      especially the cure of the sick by the medicine-men, was from the devil, and they would have nothing to do with
      it, those who at first originated and propagated it having been among the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_749">
      749</span>more intelligent and progressive of the uneducated Indians. Very few of those who had learned to read
      and had been in Sabbath school for a considerable length of time were drawn into it. It was the class between the
      most educated and the most superstitious who at first upheld it. They seemed to know too much to continue in the
      old-style religious ceremonies, but not to know enough and to be too superstitious to fully believe the Bible.
      Consequently, the medicine-men were at first bitterly opposed to it. About this time, however, an order came from
      the Indian department to stop all medicine-men from practicing their incantations over the sick. As a respectable
      number of the Indians had declared against the old style of curing the sick, it seemed to be a good time to
      enforce this order, as there was sufficient popular opinion in connection with the authority of the agent to
      enforce it. This was done, and then the medicine-men almost entirely joined the Shakers, as their style was more
      nearly in accordance with the old style than with the religion of the Bible.</p>

    <p>As it spread, one Indian went so far as to declare himself to be Christ again come to earth, and rode through the
      streets of Olympia at the head of several scores of his followers with his hands outstretched as Christ was when
      he was crucified. But he was so ridiculed by other Indians and by the whites that he gave up this idea and simply
      declared himself to be a prophet who had received revelations from heaven.</p>

    <p>For several years there has been very little of the shaking or this mode of worship among the Indians on the
      reservation, excepting secretly when persons were sick. Still, their native superstition and their intercourse
      with those off the reservation, who sometimes hold a special gathering and meeting when their followers grow cold
      and careless, has kept the belief in it as a religion firm in their hearts, so that lately, since they have become
      citizens, and are hence more free from the authority of the agent, the practice of it has become more common,
      especially when persons are sick.</p>

    <p>In fact, while it is a religion for use at all times, yet it is practiced especially over the sick, and in this
      way takes the place of the medicine-men and their methods. Unlike the system of the medicine-men, it has no single
      performer. Though often they select for leader one who can pray the best, yet in his absence another may take the
      lead. Like the old system, it has much noise. Especially do they use bells, which are rung over the person where
      the sickness is supposed to be. The others present use their influence to help in curing the sick one, and so
      imitate the attendants on an Indian doctor, getting down upon their knees on the floor and holding up their hands,
      with a candle in each hand, sometimes for an hour. They believe that by so holding up their hands the man who is
      ringing the bell will get the sickness out more easily than he otherwise would. They use candles both when they
      attempt to cure the sick and in their general service, eschewing lamps for fear of being easily tempted, as they
      believe coal-oil lights to be from Satan.</p>

    <p>In another point also this resembles very closely their old religion. For a long time before a person is taken
      sick they foretell that his spirit is gone to heaven and profess to be able to bring it back and restore it to
      him, so that he will not die as soon as he otherwise would. This was also a part of the old <i>tomahnous</i>
      belief.</p>

    <p>They have also prophesied very much. Several times when a person has died they have told me that someone had
      foretold this event, but they have never told me this until after the event happened, except in one case. They
      have prophesied much in regard to the end of the world and the day of judgment. Generally, the time set has been
      on a Fourth of July, and many have been frightened as the time drew near, but, alas, in every instance the
      prophecy failed. Like Christians, they believe in a Supreme Being, in prayer, the sabbath, in heaven and hell, in
      man as a sinner, and Christ as a savior, and the system led its followers to stop drinking, gambling, betting,
      horse racing, the use of tobacco, and the old-style incantations over the sick. Of late years, however, some of
      them have fallen from grace.</p>

    <p>It has been a somewhat strange freak of human nature, a combination of morals and immorals, of Protestantism,
      Catholicism, and old Indian practices, of dreams <span class="pagenum" id="Page_750">750</span>and visions—a
      study in mental philosophy, showing what the mind may do under certain circumstances. Yet it is all easily
      accounted for. These Indians have mingled with the whites for a long time, nearly ever since most of them were
      small. All classes of whites have made sport of their religion—the infidel, the profane man, the immoral one, the
      moral one, and the Christian—and they have been told that God and the Bible were against it, consequently they
      lost faith in it. But the Indian must have some religion. He can not do without one. They were not ready to accept
      the Bible in all its purity. They wanted more excitement. Like the Dakota Indians more recently, they saw that
      Christ was the great center of the most powerful religion of the most powerful, intelligent, successful, and
      wisest nations with whom they came in contact. Consequently they formulated a system for themselves that would
      fill all their required conditions, and when a few leaders had originated it, a large share of the rest were ripe
      to accept it, but having had more Christian teaching than the wild Dakotas, it took a somewhat different form,
      with no thought of war and with more of real Christianity.</p>

  <p>James Wickersham, esquire, of Tacoma, Washington, the well-known historian of that region, is the regular attorney
    for these people as a religious organization, and is consequently in a position to speak with authority concerning
    them. In reply to a letter of inquiry, he states that the Shakers believe in an actual localized heaven and hell,
    and reverence the Bible, but regard John Slocum’s revelations as of more authority. “They practice the strictest
    morality, sobriety, and honesty. Their 500 or 600 members are models, and it is beyond question that they do not
    drink whisky, gamble, or race, and are more free from vice than any other church. They practice a mixture of
    Catholic, Presbyterian, and old Indian ceremonies, and allow only Indians in the church. They have five churches,
    built by themselves, and the sect is growing quite rapidly.” From all this it would appear that the Shaker religion
    is a distinct advance as compared with the old Indian system.</p>

  <p>Under date of December 5, 1892, Mr Wickersham wrote again on this subject, as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I read your letter to my Indian friends, and they beg me to write you and explain that they are not Ghost
      dancers, and have no sympathy with that ceremony or any other founded on the Dreamer religion. That they believe
      in heaven as do the orthodox Christians; also in Christ, and God, the Father of all; that they believe in future
      rewards and punishments, but not in the Bible particularly. They do believe in it as a history, but they do not
      value it as a book of revelation. They do not need it, for John Slocum personally came back from a conference with
      the angels at the gates of heaven, and has imparted to them the actual facts and the angelic words of the means of
      salvation.</p>

    <p>This testimony is even better than the words of Christ contained in the Bible, for John Slocum comes 1800 years
      nearer; he is an Indian, and personally appears to them and in Indian language reports the facts. These people
      believe Slocum as firmly as the martyr at the stake believed in that for which he offered up his life; but it is
      the Christian religion which they believe, and not the Ghost dance or Dreamer religion.</p>

    <p>In short, they have a mixture of Catholic, Protestant, and Indian ceremonies, with a thorough belief in John
      Slocum’s personal visit to heaven, and his return with a mission to save the Indians and so guide them that they,
      too, shall reach the realms of bliss. Personally, I think they are honest, but mistaken; but the belief certainly
      has beneficial effect, and has reduced drinking and crime to a minimum among the members of the “Shaker” or
      “Tschaddam” church.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_751">751</span></p>

    <p>In conclusion, permit me to say that the general assembly of the Presbyterian church in this state has several
      times examined into the religion and character of the Shaker or Slocum church, and has highly indorsed its people
      and their character and actions. Yowaluch is their head now, and the strongest man mentally among them.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Some months later Mr Wickersham forwarded a circumstantial and carefully written statement of the history and
    present condition of the movement. In accordance with his request, we publish it as written, omitting only some
    paragraphs which do not bear directly on the general subject. It may be considered as an official statement of the
    Shaker case by their legally constituted representative. As might have been expected, he takes direct issue with
    those who have opposed the new religion. The reader will note the recurrence of the Indian sacred number, four, in
    Slocum’s speech, as also the fact that his first trance was the culmination of a serious illness.</p>

  <h3><i>Tschaddam or Shaker religion</i></h3>

  <p>“On Christmas day, 1854, a treaty was signed at the mouth of Shenahnam or Medicine creek, on the south side of
    Puget sound, Washington, between Isaac I. Stevens, governor and ex officio superintendent of Indian affairs for the
    United States, and the chief and headmen of the Nisqually, Puyallup, and other small tribes of Indians residing
    around the south shores of Puget sound.”</p>

  <p>“One of these small tribes was the Squaxin, situated on the southwestern branch or arm of Puget sound, now known as
    Little Skookum bay, in Mason county, Washington, near Olympia. The remaining members of this tribe yet live on the
    old home places, having purchased small tracts of their old hunting grounds from the first settlers; and they now
    make a living by fishing and gathering oysters as in days of old. Of the fishy tribe of Squaxin was born John
    Slocum, as he is known to the ‘Boston man,’ but to his native friends he is known as Squ-sacht-un.”</p>

  <p>“John Slocum, Squ-sacht-un, is now (1893) about 51 years of age, about 5 feet 8 inches high, and weighs about 160
    pounds; rather stoop shouldered, with a scattering beard, a shock of long black hair, a flat head (fashionably flat,
    and produced by pressure while a baby), bright eyes, but in all rather a common expression of countenance. He is
    modest and rather retiring, but has unquestioned confidence in himself and his mission. He is married, and up to the
    time of his translation was looked on as a common Indian, with a slight inclination to fire-water and pony racing,
    as well as a known fondness for Indian gambling.”</p>

  <p>“In the month of October, 1881, Slocum was unaccountably drawn to think of his evil courses. While in the woods he
    knelt and prayed to God, and began seriously to think of the error of his ways and of the evil days that had fallen
    on his few remaining native friends. Whisky, gambling, idleness, and general vice had almost exterminated his
    people. His eyes were opened to the folly of these facts, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_752">752</span>
    prayed. He, however, became sick; and as his sickness increased, these ideas became brighter in his mind and his
    duty more clear. He grew worse, and one day he died. He was pronounced dead by all present, and was laid out for
    burial. His brother went to Olympia for a coffin, and a grave was prepared. He died at 4 oclock in the morning, and
    late in the afternoon he again resumed life and recovered consciousness.”</p>

  <p>“His recovery was rapid, and immediately he told those present that during his term of death his soul had been to
    heaven, where it had been met by the angels, who, after a proper inquiry as to his name, etc., told him that he had
    been bad on earth, and reminded him very forcibly of his shortcomings while there, and finally wound up by informing
    him that he could not enter heaven, but that he could either go to hell or could go back to the earth and preach to
    the Indians and tell them the way to heaven. He accepted this latter proposition, and the result was that his soul
    again returned to earth, reentered its old body, and has from that day to this animated Slocum with the spirit of a
    crusader against gambling, whisky drinking, and other ‘Boston’ vices.”</p>

  <p>“About a year ago I was employed by these people as their attorney, and at their request attended the meetings in
    Mason county, and had a long conference with them. As a practical person would, Slocum undertook to demonstrate to
    me his honesty and the divine character of their religion, and at a large meeting composed only of Indians, members
    of his church, he made to me a long public statement of facts, and explained, through an interpreter, the character
    of their religion and of their belief. I wrote down at the time a synopsis of what was said to me, and now quote it
    at some length as being the exact words of Slocum, and as the best explanation of their religion.”</p>

  <p>“Standing before all his people, in the most solemn and impressive manner, in their church, he said in substance:”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The witnesses have spoken the truth. I was sick about two weeks, and had five Indian doctors. I grew very weak
      and poor. Dr Jim was there. He could not cure me. They wanted to save me, but my soul would die two or three hours
      at a time. At night my breath was out, and I died. All at once I saw a shining light—great light—trying my soul. I
      looked and saw my body had no soul—looked at my own body—it was dead.”</p>

    <p>“I came through the first time and told my friends, ‘When I die, don’t cry,’ and then I died again. Before this I
      shook hands and told my friends I was going to die. Angels told me to look back and see my body. I did, and saw it
      lying down. When I saw it, it was pretty poor. My soul left body and went up to judgment place of God. I do not
      know about body after 4 oclock.”</p>

    <p>“I have seen a great light in my soul from that good land; I have understand all Christ wants us to do. Before I
      came alive I saw I was sinner. Angel in heaven said to me, ‘You must go back and turn alive again on earth.’ I
      learned that I must be good Christian man on earth, or will be punished. My soul was told that I must come back
      and live four days on earth. When I came back, I told my friends, ‘There is a God—there is a Christian people. My
      good friends, be Christian.’”</p>

    <p>“When I came alive, I tell my friends, ‘Good thing in heaven. God is kind to us. If you all try hard and help me
      we will be better men on earth.’ And now we all feel that it is so.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_753">753</span></p>

    <p>“A good Christian man prayed with me four days. After four days, a voice said to me, ‘You shall live on earth
      four weeks.’ My soul was told that they must build a church for me in four weeks. I had lumber for a house, and my
      friends built church. Had it all done in four weeks but 6 feet of roof, and spread a mat over that. Soon as the
      church was finished the people came and filled the house and began to worship God. I felt strong—bigger than
      today—all these men know this. My friends worked hard, and I am here because they finished the house in four
      weeks. My soul was told to remain on earth four weeks more. All my friends came, and every Saturday we worshiped
      God. In four weeks more my soul was told that I should live on earth four years if I did right and preached for
      God. All felt thankful, and people joined the church—about fifty people. I was promised more time if we worshiped
      God.”</p>

    <p>“A bad man can’t reach heaven. I believe in God. I saw how bad I used to be. God sends us light to see. They know
      in heaven what we think. When people are sick, we pray to God to cure us. We pray that he take the evil away and
      leave the good. If man don’t be Christian, he will suffer and see what is bad. When we remember Jesus Christ’s
      name, we always felt happy in our hearts. This is good road for us to travel if we hold on. If we do, God’s angels
      are near to our souls. Power from this to help us. When we pray, it helps us lots in our hearts. We don’t do good
      sometimes, because our hearts are not right. When our body and heart feel warm, we do good and sing good songs. As
      Christ said, he sends power to every believing soul on earth.”</p>

    <p>“While one man can try to start religion here on earth, it don’t do much good; they won’t believe him much.
      That’s why we join to worship. Now we are preparing ourselves for judgment. For it is said, it don’t make any
      difference if he prays good and does good. God gives him help and words to speak. Makes no difference if ‘Boston’
      or Indian, if God helps we know it. These things are what we learned. We learn good while we pray—voice says, Do
      good.”</p>

    <p>“It is ten years, now, since we began, and we have good things. We all love these things and will follow them all
      time. We learn to help ourselves when sick. When our friend is sick, we kneel and ask for help to cure him. We
      learn something once in a while to cure him. Then we do as we know to help him and cure him. If we don’t learn to
      help him, we generally lose him.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>“This is a pretty accurate synopsis of the speech delivered to me by Slocum, and translated by another Indian, who
    spoke pretty good English. But that a more thorough knowledge may be given of their religious belief, I give also a
    brief synopsis of another speech made at the same meeting by Louis Yowaluch, a full-blood Indian, who is the legal
    head of this church. It is about as follows:”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Well, my friend, we was about the poorest tribe on earth. We was only tribe now full blood and nothing else. We
      would not believe anything. Minister came here, but we laugh at him. We loved bad habits—stealing—and John Slocum
      died. He was not a religious man—knew nothing of God—all of us same. We heard there was a God from Slocum—we could
      see it. Same time we heard God, we believe it. I was worst of lot. I was drunkard—was half starving—spent every
      cent for whisky. I gambled, raced horses, bet shirt, money, blankets—did not know any better.”</p>

    <p>“John Slocum brought good to us; his words civilized us. We could see. We all felt blind those times. We lost by
      drowning—our friends drink whisky and the canoes turn over—we died out in the bay. Today who stopped us from these
      things?”</p>

    <p>“John Slocum came alive, and I remember God and felt frightened. We never heard such a thing as a man dying and
      bring word that there was a God. I became sick for three weeks, four weeks. I hear a voice saying to soul,
      ‘Tomorrow they will be coming to fix you up.’ Had just heard about John Slocum, and knew it was punishment for my
      bad habits. My heart was black—it was a bad thing.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_754">754</span></p>

    <p>“Now I have quit swearing—my heart is upside down—it is changed. After I heard the voice I heard another say:
      ‘There it is now—some one to fix you up. Have you prepared your heart? If you don’t believe in Christ, you will go
      into a big fire and burn forever.’ I saw a man’s hand coming to my heart. That day I got up—was well—talked to my
      friends, advising them. I will remain a follower of Christ as long as I live.”</p>

    <p>“Long ago we knew nothing at all. When Slocum came back from God, we found out there was a God. From that time we
      have prayed for anything we want. We follow God’s way. God teaches us if we do bad we will go to hell. That’s why
      we pray and avoid bad habits. If we don’t ask grace, bad things come when we eating. When we drink water, we think
      about God before drinking. If we don’t think of him, may be we get sick from water. If traveling, may be we die if
      we don’t think of God. We are afraid to do wrong against God. Long time ago we worked on Sundays, but no more now.
      Our brother Christ has given us six days to work. On Sunday pray to God. God put people here to grow—puts our soul
      in our body. That’s why we pray so much. If we quit, like a man quit his job, he gets no pay. We would go to fire
      in hell. We have no power to put out hell fire.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>“Louis Yowaluch is the strong man of the Shaker church. He is 6 feet tall, rawboned, muscular, and rather slow.
    While he may once have been, as he says, a drunkard, he is now a Christian man. His conservativeness makes him a
    fine leader for the organization, while all the Indians respect him for his humanity and charity, for his honesty
    and uprightness, for his fearlessness and love of right. He fully and freely places John Slocum at the head of the
    church, as the man who ascended to heaven and brought back a personal knowledge of the road, but at the same time he
    takes the lead in laying out work, building churches, and sending out preachers to new tribes.”</p>

  <p>“A new feature of this religion is found in Sam Yowaluch, the brother of Louis. He is younger than Louis, and has
    more of the native superstition in his character. He has by common consent been placed at the head of the faith-cure
    branch of the church. The following synopsis of his ‘talk’ will be an explanation of his position:”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Among the Shakers, John Slocum is first. Louis is next. I take power and cure people when they are sick. Long
      time ago I knew nothing—just like an animal. No doctoring, no medicine—no good. I was a drunkard, was a thief, and
      a robber. When I joined this religion, I was told to be good. When John Slocum was preaching, I heard that if I
      prayed I would have power and be a medicine-man, and could cure the sick. From time John Slocum preached I tried
      to be a good Christian man. I prayed and was sick—my soul was sick. I prayed to God and he pays me for that. There
      is lots of difference between this power and old Indian doctoring. This is not old power. I can cure people now. I
      have cured some white men and women, but they are ashamed to tell it. I cure without money. One big, rich man,
      Henry Walker, was sick—had great pains in his ear and leg. Doctor at Olympia failed to cure him, and he came to
      John Slocum and me. We worked for him, prayed, and he lay down and slept and was cured. He offered us twenty
      dollars—but no, we refused it. God will pay us when we die. This is our religion. When we die, we get our pay from
      God.”</p>

    <p>“No, we do not believe the Bible. We believe in God, and in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, and we believe in a
      hell. In these matters we believe the same as the Presbyterians. We think fully of God today. A good Christian man
      is a good medicine-man. A good Christian man in the dark sees a light toward God. God makes a fog—good Christian
      man goes straight through it to the end, like good <span class="pagenum" id="Page_755">755</span>medicine. I
      believe this religion. It helps poor people. Bad man can’t see good—bad man can’t get to heaven—can’t find his
      way. We were sent to jail for this religion, but we will never give up. We all believe that John Slocum died and
      went to heaven, and was sent back to preach to the people. We all talk about that and believe it.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>“The Shakers use candles, bells, crucifixes, Catholic pictures, etc., in their church and other ceremonies. As Mr
    Ellis says, they use paraphernalia of the Catholic, Presbyterian, and even some of the Indian religion. They cross
    themselves as the Catholics do; they say grace before and after meals; they stand and pray and chant in unison; they
    set candles around the dead as the Catholics do, and believe in the cure of the sick by faith and prayer. In times
    of excitement many of them twitch and shake, but in no instance do they conduct themselves in so nervous a manner as
    I have seen orthodox Christians do at old Sandy Branch camp-meeting in Illinois. They believe that by praying with a
    man or woman and rubbing the person they could induce them to join their church, and could rub away their sins; but
    they have no rite, no ceremony, no belief, no policy, no form of religion that is not in use by some one or other of
    our orthodox people.”</p>

  <p>“Their religion, in brief, is a belief in God as the father and ruler of all, and in Jesus Christ as the Son of God
    and the Savior of mankind. They know there is a heaven, for John Slocum was there, and believe in a hell of fire for
    the punishment of sinners, because the angels in heaven told John Slocum about it. They do not care for the Bible.
    It is of no use to them, for they have a distinct revelation direct from heaven. This is the only practical
    difference between them and the orthodox believers, and this they do not care for.”</p>

  <p>Mr Wickersham then gives an account of the persecutions to which the rising sect was for a long time subjected,
    chiefly at the hands of agent Edwin Eells and his brother, Reverend Myron Eells, already quoted at length, who was
    at that time the missionary on the Skokomish reservation. As Mr Wickersham’s statements in this regard are mainly in
    the form of extended quotations from Ten Years’ Missionary Work at Skokomish, written by the Reverend Mr Eells
    himself, they may be regarded as conclusive. It is apparent that a part at least of this persecution, which took the
    shape of banishment, chains, and imprisonment, and even the forcible seizure of a dead body from the bereaved
    relatives, was due to the fact that the Shakers, who considered themselves a genuine branch of the Christian church,
    were disposed to lean toward Catholicity rather than toward the denominational form upheld by the agent and his
    brother.</p>

  <p>However, religious persecution failed as utterly in its purpose in this case as it has and must in all others.
    Quoting from Mr Eells, “The chiefs did not care if they were deposed, were about to resign, and did not wish to have
    anything more to do with the ‘Boston’ religion or the agent. Billy Clams was ready, if need be, to suffer as Christ
    did. He was willing to be a martyr.”</p>

  <p>Mr Wickersham continues:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“While Billy Clams and some of his people publicly abandoned the forms of Shaker religion rather than be
      banished, yet John Slocum and his people refused to so surrender, and the agent sent out his police and arrested
      John Slocum, Louis Yowaluch, and two or three more of these people—good, true men—and, loading their limbs with
      chains, confined them for several weeks in the dirty little single room of a jail at the Puyallup agency, near
      Tacoma. Their only offense was worship of a different form from that adopted by the agent and his brother. They
      had broken no law, created no disorder, and yet they suffered ignominious incarceration in a vile dungeon, loaded
      with chains, at the pleasure of the agent. The Shakers believed in God, in Jesus Christ, in heaven and hell, in
      temperance, sobriety, and a virtuous life. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_757">757</span> abandoned the
      old Indian religion and all its vices and forms, including the power of the doctors or medicine-men. These
      medicine-men had a great hold on the Indian mind, and they joined the minister and the agent in their fight on the
      Shakers, because the Shakers fought them; so that there was seen the unique spectacle of the savage shamanism of
      the American Indian and the supposed orthodox religion of civilization hand in hand fighting the followers of
      Jesus Christ.”</p>

    <p>“Imprisonment, banishment, threats, chains, and the general ill will of the agent and all his employees were
      visited on these Shakers who continued to practice their forms of worship, and yet they did continue it. In spite
      of the fact that they occupied a place only half-way between slaves and freemen, and were under the orders of the
      agent and subject to be harassed and annoyed all the time by him, yet they continued nobly and fearlessly to
      practice their religion and to worship God and Jesus Christ as they saw fit. To do it, however, they were forced
      to stay away from the reservations, where the greater number of employees were located, and their churches were
      built on Mud bay and Oyster bay, far away from the reservations.”</p>

    <p>“But a brighter day came for these people, a day when they could stand up and defy every form or force of
      persecution. In 1886 Congress passed the Indian land severalty bill, an act providing for dividing lands in
      severalty to Indians, and providing that those who took lands and adopted the habits of civilized life should be
      American citizens, with all the rights, privileges, and immunities of any other citizen. In 1892 I was appointed
      by Judge Hanford to defend a prisoner in the United States district court at Tacoma. The prisoner was accused of
      selling liquor to a Puyallup Indian, but it appeared on cross-examination that this Indian owned land in
      severalty, voted, paid taxes, and exercised other rights of citizenship. The question was then raised by me on
      motion to dismiss, that these land-holding, tax-paying Indians were citizens of the United States, free and
      independent. The United States prosecuting attorney appeared to contest the claim, but after an extended argument
      Judge Hanford held with me, and the prisoner was discharged.”</p>

    <p>“The effect of this decision was far-reaching. It meant that all land-holding Indians were no longer wards of the
      government, but free citizens and not under the control of the Indian agent. The Shaker people, hearing this, sent
      a deputation to see me, and I held a long consultation with them, assuring them that they were as free as the
      agent, and could establish their own church, own and build houses of worship, and do both in religious and worldly
      matters as other citizens of the United States could. This was glorious news to them. It meant freedom, it meant
      the cessation of persecution and annoyance by the agency employees, and they were jubilant.”</p>

    <p>“Accordingly they met on June 6, 1892, at Mud bay, at Louis Yowaluch’s house, and organized their church on a
      regular business basis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_758">758</span> The following officers were elected:
      Headman, Louis Yowaluch; elders, John Slocum, Louis Yowaluch, John Smith, James Walker, Charles Walker, John W.
      Simmons, and William James. At this meeting the following persons were also appointed ministers of this church,
      and licenses were issued to them, to wit: Louis Yowaluch, John Slocum, James Tobin, John Powers, and Richard
      Jackson. Provision was made to establish a church at the Puyallup reservation, where the power of the agent had
      hitherto kept them out, and William James, a Puyallup landowner, gave land for a church. After much talk about
      sending out ministers, etc., the meeting adjourned, after a two days’ session, and the Shaker church, after eleven
      years’ fighting against persecutions, was an established fact, free and independent, with its own officers,
      ministers, and church property.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The spectacle of an Indian church with Indian officers, preachers, and members, and of houses built by the
      Indians for church purposes, was too much for the average citizen of Puget sound, and the Shakers were continually
      disturbed, not only by the whites, but by the Indians who could not and did not appreciate the change to
      citizenship, so that I was constantly applied to for protection by the ministers and members of the Shaker church.
      A ‘paper’ has a great effect on the average Indian, and I issued on application several papers addressed in
      general terms to those who might be disposed to interfere with them, which had a quieting effect and caused
      evil-disposed persons to respect the Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_759">759</span> and their
      religion, or at least to let them alone. They now feel quite confident of their position, and are acting quite
      like the average citizen. Even the persons who persecuted them for eleven years now felt obliged to retire from
      the conflict, and a day of peace is reached at last.”</p>

    <p>“The Shaker church now reaches over nearly the whole of western Washington. The story of Slocum’s death and visit
      to heaven, and his return to preach to the Indians, is accepted by them as a direct revelation of the will of God.
      They say that they do not need to read the Bible, for do they not have better and more recent testimony of the
      existence of heaven and of the way to that celestial home than is contained in the Bible? Here is John Slocum,
      alive, and has he not been to heaven? Then, why read the Bible to learn the road, when John can so easily tell
      them all about it? The Bible says there are many roads; the Catholics have one, the Presbyterians another, and the
      Congregationalists a third; but John Slocum gives them a short, straight road—and they choose that.”</p>

    <p>“The Shaker church now has a building for church purposes at Mud bay, at Oyster bay, at Cowlitz, Chehalis, and
      Puyallup. They have about a dozen ministers regularly licensed, and about 500 members. Most of the Indians at
      Skokomish belong, while the Squaxins, Chehalis, Nisqually, Cowlitz, and Columbia River Indians, and in fact the
      majority of the Indians of western Washington, either belong or are in sympathy with its teachings, so that it is
      now the strongest church among them. They are sending out runners to the Yakimas east of the Cascade mountains,
      and expect before long to make an effort to convert that tribe.”</p>

    <p>“The Indian is inclined to be weak, and to adopt the vices of the white man, but not his virtues. However, this
      is not true of the Shakers. They do not drink intoxicants of any kind, and make a special effort at all times to
      banish liquor. This is the strong element in their faith, and the one for which they fight hardest. They feel upon
      their honor in the matter, and contrast the members of their church at every place with those belonging to the
      other denominations—and it is too true that an Indian does not seem at all to be restrained from drink by
      belonging to the other churches as he does in the Shaker church. In the others he feels no personal interest. The
      honor of neither himself nor his people is involved, and if he disgraces himself it reflects, in his opinion,
      rather on the white man’s church. Not so with the Shakers. No white man belongs to their church, and it is their
      boast that no white preacher can keep his Indian members from drink as they can—and it is true. After their
      opposition to liquor, next comes gambling. From these two vices flow nearly all troubles to the Indian, and the
      Shakers are certainly successful in extinguishing their spread among the Indians. They make special war on
      drunkenness, gambling, and horse racing, and preach honesty, sobriety, temperance, and right living.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_760">760</span></p>

    <p>“The Presbyterian church occupies a queer position, with regard to these people. The Reverend M. G. Mann has been
      the missionary to the Indians of Puget sound for many years, and has succeeded in making a very favorable
      impression upon them. He has been specially attentive to the Shakers, and, to his credit be it said, has never
      tried to coerce them, and has only dealt with them kindly. So far has this gone that Louis Yowaluch was long ago
      taken into the Presbyterian church, and is now an accredited elder therein. Louis does not know, seemingly, how to
      escape from his dual position, or rather does not seem to think that he needs to escape. It all seems to be for
      the best interest of his people, so he continues to occupy the position of elder in the Presbyterian church and
      headman of the Shaker church.”</p>

    <p>“At a recent meeting of the Presbyterian ministers the position of these Shaker people was fully discussed, and
      the strongest language was used in saying only good about them, and every effort seems to be made by the
      Presbyterians to claim the Shakers in a body as members of the Presbyterian church. If this account were not
      already too long, the reports of the church on the subject would be quoted, but the fact speaks volumes for the
      character of the Shakers and their teaching.”</p>

    <p class="mb0">“In conclusion: I have known the Shaker people now intimately, as their attorney, for more than a year, and out
      of the many drunken Indians I have seen in that time not one was a Shaker. Not one of their people has been
      arrested for crime in that time. They are good citizens, and are far more temperate and peaceable than those
      Indians belonging to the other churches. I feel that their church is a grand success in that it prevents idleness
      and vice, drunkenness and disorder, and tends to produce quiet, peaceable citizens, and good Christian people. I
      think the Presbyterians make a mistake in trying to bring the Shakers into their fold—they ought rather to protect
      them and give them every assistance in their autonomy. It adds the greatest incentive to their labors, and makes
      them feel as if they were of some account. It lets them labor for themselves, instead of feeling, as always
      heretofore, that some one else—they hardly knew who—was responsible. Their forms of Christianity are not very
      unorthodox—their Christianity is quite orthodox, not exactly because they take Slocum’s revelation instead of the
      Bible, but the result is the same—a Christian.”</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="p2">From competent Indian informants of eastern Washington—Charles Ike, half-blood Yakima interpreter, and Chief Wolf
    Necklace of the Pä’lus, we gather additional particulars, from which it would appear that there are more things in
    the Shaker system than are dreamed of in the philosophy of the Presbyterian general assembly.</p>

  <p>According to their statements, Yowaluch, or Ai-yäl, as he is known east of the Cascades, was noted as a gambler
    before he received his revelation. His followers are called <i>Shäpupu-‛lĕma</i>, or “blowers,” by<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_761">761</span> the Yakima, from the fact that on meeting a stranger, instead of at
    once shaking hands with him in the usual manner, they first wave the hand gently in front of his face like a fan,
    and blow on him, in order to “blow away the badness” from him. They first appeared among the Yakima and other
    eastern tribes about six years ago, and are gradually gaining adherents, although as yet they have no regular time
    or place of assembly. They are much addicted to making the sign of the cross—the cross, it is hardly necessary to
    state, being as much an Indian as a Christian symbol—and are held in great repute as doctors, their treatment
    consisting chiefly of hypnotic performances over the patient, resulting in the spasmodic shaking already described.
    In doctoring a patient the “blowers” usually gather around him in a circle to the number of about twelve, dressed in
    a very attractive ceremonial costume, and each wearing on his head a sort of crown of woven cedar bark, in which are
    fixed two lighted candles, while in his right hand he carries a small cloth, and in the left another lighted candle.
    By fastening screens of colored cloth over the candles the light is made to appear yellow, white, or blue. The
    candle upon the forehead is yellow, symbolic of the celestial glory; that at the back of the head is white, typical
    of the terrestrial light, while the third is blue, the color of the sky.</p>

  <p>Frequently also they carry in their hands or wear on their heads garlands of roses and other flowers of various
    colors, yellow, white, and blue being the favorite, which they say represent the colors of objects in the celestial
    world. While the leader is going through his hypnotic performance over the patient the others are waving the cloths
    and swinging in circles the candles held in their hands. In all this it is easy to see the influence of the Catholic
    ritual, with its censers, tapers, and flowers, with which these tribes have been more or less familiar for the last
    fifty years.</p>

  <p>A single instance will suffice to show the methods of the blower doctors. The story is told from the Indian point
    of view, as related by the half-blood interpreter, who believed it all. About six years ago two of these doctors
    from the north, while visiting near Woodland on the Columbia, were called to the assistance of a woman who was
    seriously ill, and had received no benefit from the treatment of the native doctors. They came and almost
    immediately on seeing the patient announced to the relatives that the sickness had been put into her by the evil
    magic of a neighboring medicine-man, whom they then summoned into their presence. When the messenger arrived for
    him, the medicine-man refused to go, saying that the doctors were liars and that he had not made the woman ill. By
    their clairaudient power—or possibly by a shrewd anticipation of probabilities—the doctors in the other house knew
    of his refusal and sent another messenger to tell him that concealment or denial would not avail him, and that if he
    refused to come they would proceed to blow the sickness into his own body. Without further<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_762">762</span> argument he accompanied the messengers to the sick woman’s house. As he entered, the
    chief doctor stepped up to him and looking intently into his face, said, “I can see your heart within your body, and
    it is black with evil things. You are not fit to live. You are making this woman sick, but we shall take out the
    badness from her body.” With the cloths and lighted candles the two doctors then approached the sick woman, and
    commanded her to arise, which she did, although she had been supposed to be too weak to stand. Waving the cloths in
    front of her with a gentle fanning motion, and blowing upon her at the same time, they proceeded to drive the
    disease out of her body, beginning at the feet and working upward until, as they approached the head the principal
    doctor changed the movement to a rapid fanning and corresponding blowing, while the assistant stood ready with his
    cloth to seize the disease when it should be driven out. All this time the medicine-man standing a few feet away was
    shaking and quivering like one in a fit, and the trembling became more violent and spasmodic as the doctors
    increased the speed of their motions. Finally the leader brought his hands together over the woman’s head, where,
    just as the disease attempted to escape, it was seized and imprisoned in the cloth held by his assistant. Then,
    going up to the medicine-man, with a few rapid passes they fanned the disease into his body and he fell down dead.
    The woman recovered, and with her sister has recently come up to the Yakima country as an apostle of the new
    religion, preaching the doctrines and performing the wonders which she has been taught by the Nisqually doctors.</p>

  <p>This is the Indian story as told by the half-blood, who did not claim to have been an eye-witness, but spoke of it
    as a matter of common knowledge and beyond question. It is doubtless substantially correct. The hypnotic action
    described is the same which the author has repeatedly seen employed in the Ghost dance, resulting successively in
    involuntary trembling, violent spasmodic action, rigidity, and final deathlike unconsciousness. The Ghost dancers
    regard the process not only as a means of bringing them into trance communication with their departed friends, but
    also as a preventive and cure of disease, just as we have our faith healers and magnetic doctors. With the Indian’s
    implicit faith in the supernatural ability of the doctor, it is easy to suppose that the mental effect on the woman,
    who was told and believed that she was to be cured, would aid recovery if recovery was possible. It is unlikely that
    death resulted to the medicine-man. It is more probable that under the hypnotic spell of the doctors he fell
    unconscious and apparently lifeless and remained so perhaps for a considerable time, as frequently happens with
    sensitive subjects in the Ghost dance. The fact that the same process should produce exactly opposite effects in the
    two subjects is easily explainable. The object of the hypnotic performance was simply to bring the mind of the
    subject under the control of the operator. This accomplished, the mental, and ultimately the<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_763">763</span> physical, effect on either subject was whatever the operator wished it to be. After
    bringing both under mental control in the manner described, he suggested recovery to the woman and sickness or death
    to the medicine-man, and the result followed.</p>

  <p>Until the advent of these women from beyond the mountains such hypnotic performances seem to have been unknown
    among the Yakima and other eastern tribes of the Columbia region, the trance condition in the Smohalla devotees
    being apparently due entirely to the effect of the rhythmic dances and songs acting on excited imaginations, without
    the aid of blowing or manual passes.</p>

  <p>Hypnotism and so-called magnetism, however, appear to have been employed by the medicine-men of the Chinook tribes
    of the lower Columbia from ancient times. Especially wonderful in this connection are the stories told of one of
    these men residing at Wushqûm or Wisham, near The Dalles.</p>

  <p>About the time the two blower doctors appeared at Woodland, other apostles of the same doctrine, or it may have
    been the same two men, went up Willamet river into central Oregon, teaching the same system and performing the same
    wonders among the tribes of that region. And here comes in a remarkable coincidence, if it be no more. It is said
    among the northern Indians that on this journey these apostles met, somewhere in the south, a young man to whom they
    taught their mysteries, in which he became such an apt pupil that he soon outstripped his teachers, and is now
    working even greater wonders among his own people. This young man can be no other than Wovoka, the messiah of the
    Ghost dance, living among the Paiute in western Nevada. The only question is whether the story told among the
    Columbia tribes is a myth based on vague rumors of the southern messiah and his hypnotic performances, so similar to
    that of the blower doctors, or whether Wovoka actually derived his knowledge of such things from these northern
    apostles. The latter supposition is entirely within the bounds of possibility. The time corresponds with the date of
    his original revelations, as stated by himself to the writer. He is a young man, and, although he has never been far
    from home, the tribe to which he belongs roams in scattered bands over the whole country to the Willamet and the
    watershed of the Columbia, so that communication with the north is by no means difficult. He himself stated that
    Indians from Warmspring reservation, in northern Oregon, have attended his dances near Walker lake.</p>

      WOVOKA THE MESSIAH</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subhead">
    <p>When the sun died, I went up to heaven and saw God and all the people who had died a long time ago. God told me
      to come back and tell my people they must be good and love one another, and not fight, or steal, or lie. He gave
      me this dance to give to my people.—<i>Wovoka.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>When Tävibo, the prophet of Mason valley, died, about 1870, he left a son named Wovoka, “The Cutter,” about 14
    years of age. The prophetic claims and teachings of the father, the reverence with which he was regarded by the
    people, and the mysterious ceremonies which were doubtless of frequent performance in the little tulé wikiup at home
    must have made early and deep impression on the mind of the boy, who seems to have been by nature of a solitary and
    contemplative disposition, one of those born to see visions and hear still voices.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The physical environment was favorable to the development of such a character. His native valley, from which he has
    never wandered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_765">765</span> is a narrow strip of level sage prairie some 30
    miles in length, walled in by the giant sierras, their sides torn and gashed by volcanic convulsions and dark with
    gloomy forests of pine, their towering summits white with everlasting snows, and roofed over by a cloudless sky
    whose blue infinitude the mind instinctively seeks to penetrate to far-off worlds beyond. Away to the south the view
    is closed in by the sacred mountain of the Paiute, where their Father gave them the first fire and taught them their
    few simple arts before leaving for his home in the upper regions of the Sun-land. Like the valley of Rasselas, it
    seems set apart from the great world to be the home of a dreamer.</p>

  <p>The greater portion of Nevada is an arid desert of rugged mountains and alkali plains, the little available land
    being confined to narrow mountain valleys and the borders of a few large lakes. These tracts are occupied by
    scattered ranchmen engaged in stock raising, and as the white population is sparse, Indian labor is largely
    utilized, the Paiute being very good workers. The causes which in other parts of the country have conspired to sweep
    the Indian from the path of the white man seem inoperative here, where the aboriginal proprietors are regarded
    rather as peons under the protection of the dominant race, and are allowed to set up their small camps of tulé
    lodges in convenient out-of-the-way places, where they spend the autumn and winter in hunting, fishing, and
    gathering seeds and piñon nuts, working at fair wages on ranches through spring and summer. In this way young Wovoka
    became attached to the family of a ranchman in Mason valley, named David Wilson, who took an interest in him and
    bestowed on him the name of Jack Wilson, by which he is commonly known among the whites. From his association with
    this family he gained some knowledge of English, together with a confused idea of the white man’s theology. On
    growing up he married, and still continued to work for Mr Wilson, earning a reputation for industry and reliability,
    but attracting no special notice until nearly 30 years of age, when he announced the revelation that has made him
    famous among the tribes of the west.</p>

  <p>Following are the various forms of his name which I have noticed: Wo′voka, or Wü′voka, which I have provisionally
    rendered “Cutter,” derived from a verb signifying “to cut;” Wevokar, Wopokahte, Kwohitsauq, Cowejo, Koit-tsow,
    Kvit-Tsow, Quoitze Ow, Jack Wilson, Jackson Wilson, Jack Winson, John Johnson. He has also been confounded with
    Bannock Jim, a Mormon Bannock of Fort Hall reservation, Idaho, and with Johnson Sides, a Paiute living near Reno,
    Nevada, and bitterly opposed to Wovoka. His father’s name, Tävibo, has been given also as Waughzeewaughber. It is
    not quite certain that the Paiute prophet of 1870 was the father of Wovoka. This is stated to have been the case by
    one of Captain Lee’s informants (<i><a href="#AGO">A. G. O.</a>, 4</i>) and by Lieutenant Phister (<i><a href="#Phister">Phister</a>, 2</i>). Wovoka himself
    says that his father did not preach, but was a “dreamer” with supernatural powers. Certain it is that a similar
    doctrine was taught by an Indian living in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_766">766</span> the same valley in
    Wovoka’s boyhood. Possibly the discrepancy might be explained by an unwillingness on the part of the messiah to
    share his spiritual honors.</p>

  <p>In proportion as Wovoka and his doctrines have become subjects of widespread curiosity, so have they become
    subjects of ignorant misrepresentation and deliberate falsification. Different writers have made him a Paiute, a
    half-blood, and a Mormon white man. Numberless stories have been told of the origin and character of his mission and
    the day predicted for its final accomplishment. The most mischievous and persistent of these stories has been that
    which represents him as preaching a bloody campaign against the whites, whereas his doctrine is one of peace, and he
    himself is a mild-tempered member of a weak and unwarlike tribe. His own good name has been filched from him and he
    has been made to appear under a dozen different cognomens, including that of his bitterest enemy, Johnson Sides. He
    has been denounced as an impostor, ridiculed as a lunatic, and laughed at as a pretended Christ, while by the
    Indians he is revered as a direct messenger from the Other World, and among many of the remote tribes he is believed
    to be omniscient, to speak all languages, and to be invisible to a white man. We shall give his own story as told by
    himself, with such additional information as seems to come from authentic sources.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding all that had been said and written by newspaper correspondents about the messiah, not one of them
    had undertaken to find the man himself and to learn from his own lips what he really taught. It is almost equally
    certain that none of them had even seen a Ghost dance at close quarters—certainly none of them understood its
    meaning. The messiah was regarded almost as a myth, something intangible, to be talked about but not to be seen. The
    first reliable information as to his personality was communicated by the scout, Arthur Chapman, who, under
    instructions from the War Department, visited the Paiute country in December, 1890, and spent four days at Walker
    lake and Mason valley, and in the course of an interview with Wovoka obtained from him a detailed statement similar
    in all essentials to that which I obtained later on. (<i><a href="#War">Sec. War</a>, 3.</i>)</p>

  <p>After having spent seven months in the field, investigating the new religion among the prairie tribes, particularly
    the Arapaho, and after having examined all the documents bearing on the subject in the files of the Indian Office
    and War Department, the author left Washington in November, 1891, to find and talk with the messiah and to gather
    additional material concerning the Ghost dance. Before starting, I had written to the agent in charge of the
    reservation to which he was attached for information in regard to the messiah (Jack Wilson) and the dance, and
    learned in reply, with some surprise, that the agent had never seen him. The surprise grew into wonder when I was
    further informed that there were “neither Ghost songs, dances, nor ceremonials”<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_767">767</span> among the Paiute.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This
    was discouraging, but not entirely convincing, and I set out once more for the west. After a few days with the Omaha
    and Winnebago in Nebraska, and a longer stay with the Sioux at Pine Ridge, where traces of the recent conflict were
    still fresh on every hand, I crossed over the mountains and finally arrived at Walker Lake reservation in Nevada.</p>

  <p>On inquiry I learned that the messiah lived, not on the reservation, but in Mason valley, about 40 miles to the
    northwest. His uncle, Charley Sheep, lived near the agency, however, so I sought him out and made his acquaintance.
    He spoke tolerable—or rather intolerable—English, so that we were able to get along together without an interpreter,
    a fact which brought us into closer sympathy, as an interpreter is generally at best only a necessary evil. As
    usual, he was very suspicious at first, and inquired minutely as to my purpose. I explained to him that I was sent
    out by the government to the various tribes to study their customs and learn their stories and songs; that I had
    obtained a good deal from other tribes and now wanted to learn some songs and stories of the Paiute, in order to
    write them down so that the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_768">768</span>white people could read them. In a
    casual way I then offered to show him the pictures of some of my Indian friends across the mountains, and brought
    out the photos of several Arapaho and Cheyenne who I knew had recently come as delegates to the messiah. This
    convinced him that I was all right, and he became communicative. The result was that we spent about a week together
    in the wikiups (lodges of tulé rushes), surrounded always by a crowd of interested Paiute, discussing the old
    stories and games, singing Paiute songs, and sampling the seed mush and roasted piñon nuts. On one of these
    occasions, at night, a medicine-man was performing his incantations over a sick child on one side of the fire while
    we were talking on the other. When the ice was well thawed, I cautiously approached the subject of the ghost songs
    and dance, and, as confidence was now established, I found no difficulty in obtaining a number of the songs, with a
    description of the ceremonial. I then told Charley that, as I had taken part in the dance, I was anxious to see the
    messiah and get from him some medicine-paint to bring back to his friends among the eastern tribes. He readily
    agreed to go with me and use his efforts with his nephew to obtain what was wanted.</p>

  <p>It is 20 miles northward by railroad from Walker River agency to Wabuska, and 12 miles more in a southwesterly
    direction from there to the Mason valley settlement. There we met a young white man named Dyer, who was well
    acquainted with Jack Wilson, and who also spoke the Paiute language, and learned from him that the messiah was about
    12 miles farther up the valley, near a place called Pine Grove. Enlisting his services, with a team and driver,
    making four in all, we started up toward the mountain. It was New Year’s day of 1892, and there was deep snow on the
    ground, a very unusual thing in this part of the country, and due in this instance, as Charley assured us, to the
    direct agency of Jack Wilson. It is hard to imagine anything more monotonously unattractive than a sage prairie
    under ordinary circumstances unless it be the same prairie when covered by a heavy fall of snow, under which the
    smaller clumps of sagebrush look like prairie-dog mounds, while the larger ones can hardly be distinguished at a
    short distance from wikiups. However, the mountains were bright in front of us, the sky was blue overhead, and the
    road was good under foot.</p>

  <p>Soon after leaving the settlement we passed the dance ground with the brush shelters still standing. We met but few
    Indians on the way. After several miles we noticed a man at some distance from the road with a gun across his
    shoulder. Dyer looked a moment and then exclaimed, “I believe that’s Jack now!” The Indian thought so, too, and
    pulling up our horses he shouted some words in the Paiute language. The man replied, and sure enough it was the
    messiah, hunting jack rabbits. At his uncle’s call he soon came over.</p>

  <p>As he approached I saw that he was a young man, a dark full-blood, compactly built, and taller than the Paiute
    generally, being nearly 6 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_769">769</span>feet in height. He was well dressed in
    white man’s clothes, with the broad-brimmed white felt hat common in the west, secured on his head by means of a
    beaded ribbon under the chin. This, with a blanket or a robe of rabbit skins, is now the ordinary Paiute dress. He
    wore a good pair of boots. His hair was cut off square on a line below the base of the ears, after the manner of his
    tribe. His countenance was open and expressive of firmness and decision, but with no marked intellectuality. The
    features were broad and heavy, very different from the thin, clear-cut features of the prairie tribes.</p>

    <figcaption class="xsmall">WINTER VIEW IN MASON VALLEY, SHOWING SNOW-COVERED SAGEBRUSH</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>As he came up he took my hand with a strong, hearty grasp, and inquired what was wanted. His uncle explained
    matters, adding that I was well acquainted with some of his Indian friends who had visited him a short time before,
    and was going back to the same people. After some deliberation he said that the whites had lied about him and he did
    not like to talk to them; some of the Indians had disobeyed his instructions and trouble had come of it, but as I
    was sent by Washington and was a friend of his friends, he would talk with me. He was hunting now, but if we would
    come to his camp that night he would tell us about his mission.</p>

  <p>With another hand-shake he left us, and we drove on to the nearest ranch, arriving about dark. After supper we got
    ready and started across country through the sagebrush for the Paiute camp, some miles away, guided by our Indian.
    It was already night, with nothing to be seen but the clumps of snow-covered sagebrush stretching away in every
    direction, and after traveling an hour or more without reaching the camp, our guide had to confess that he had lost
    the trail. It was two years since he had been there, his sight was failing, and, with the snow and the darkness, he
    was utterly at a loss to know his whereabouts.</p>

  <p>To be lost on a sage plain on a freezing night in January is not a pleasant experience. There was no road, and no
    house but the one we had left some miles behind, and it would be almost impossible to find our way back to that
    through the darkness. Excepting for a lantern there was no light but what came from the glare of the snow and a few
    stars in the frosty sky overhead. To add to our difficulty, the snow was cut in every direction by cattle trails,
    which seemed to be Indian trails, and kept us doubling and circling to no purpose, while in the uncertain gloom
    every large clump of sagebrush took on the appearance of a wikiup, only to disappoint us on a nearer approach. With
    it all, the night was bitterly cold and we were half frozen. After vainly following a dozen false trails and
    shouting repeatedly in hope of hearing an answering cry, we hit on the expedient of leaving the Indian with the
    wagon, he being the oldest man of the party, while the rest of us each took a different direction from the central
    point, following the cattle tracks in the snow and calling to each other at short intervals, in order that we might
    not become lost from one another. After going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_770">770</span> far enough to know
    that none of us had yet struck the right trail, the wagon was moved up a short distance and the same performance was
    repeated. At last a shout from our driver brought us all together. He declared that he had heard sounds in front,
    and after listening a few minutes in painful suspense we saw a shower of sparks go up into the darkness and knew
    that we had struck the camp. Going back to the wagon, we got in and drove straight across to the spot, where we
    found three or four little wikiups, in one of which we were told the messiah was awaiting our arrival.</p>

  <p>On entering through the low doorway we found ourselves in a circular lodge made of bundles of tulé rushes laid over
    a framework of poles, after the fashion of the thatched roofs of Europe, and very similar to the grass lodges of the
    Wichita. The lodge was only about 10 feet in diameter and about 8 feet in height, with sloping sides, and was almost
    entirely open above, like a cone with the top cut off, as in this part of the country rain or snow is of rare
    occurrence. As already remarked, the deep snow at the time was something unusual. In the center, built directly on
    the ground, was a blazing fire of sagebrush, upon which fresh stalks were thrown from time to time, sending up a
    shower of sparks into the open air. It was by this means that we had been guided to the camp. Sitting or lying
    around the fire were half a dozen Paiute, including the messiah and his family, consisting of his young wife, a boy
    about 4 years of age, of whom he seemed very fond, and an infant. It was plain that he was a kind husband and
    father, which was in keeping with his reputation among the whites for industry and reliability. The only articles in
    the nature of furniture were a few grass woven bowls and baskets of various sizes and patterns. There were no Indian
    beds or seats of the kind found in every prairie tipi, no rawhide boxes, no toilet pouches, not even a hole dug in
    the ground for the fire. Although all wore white men’s dress, there were no pots, pans, or other articles of
    civilized manufacture, now used by even the most primitive prairie tribes, for, strangely enough, although these
    Paiute are practically farm laborers and tenants of the whites all around them, and earn good wages, they seem to
    covet nothing of the white man’s, but spend their money for dress, small trinkets, and ammunition for hunting, and
    continue to subsist on seeds, piñon nuts, and small game, lying down at night on the dusty ground in their cramped
    wikiups, destitute of even the most ordinary conveniences in use among other tribes. It is a curious instance of a
    people accepting the inevitable while yet resisting innovation.</p>

  <p>Wovoka received us cordially and then inquired more particularly as to my purpose in seeking an interview. His
    uncle entered into a detailed explanation, which stretched out to a preposterous length, owing to a peculiar
    conversational method of the Paiute. Each statement by the older man was repeated at its close, word for word and
    sentence by sentence, by the other, with the same monotonous inflection.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_771">771</span>
    This done, the first speaker signified by a grunt of approval that it had been correctly repeated, and
    then proceeded with the next statement, which was duly repeated in like manner. The first time I had heard two old
    men conversing together in this fashion on the reservation I had supposed they were reciting some sort of Indian
    litany, and it required several such experiences and some degree of patience to become used to it.</p>

  <p>At last he signified that he understood and was satisfied, and then in answer to my questions gave an account of
    himself and his doctrine, a great part of the interpretation being by Dyer, with whom he seemed to be on intimate
    terms. He said he was about 35 years of age, fixing the date from a noted battle<a id="FNanchor_9"
    href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> between the Paiute and the whites near Pyramid lake, in 1860, at which
    time he said he was about the size of his little boy; who appeared to be of about 4 years. His father, Tävibo,
    “White Man,” was not a preacher, but was a <i>capita</i> (from the Spanish <i>capitan</i>) or petty chief, and was a
    dreamer and invulnerable. His own proper name from boyhood was Wovoka or Wüvoka, “The Cutter,” but a few years ago
    he had assumed the name of his paternal grandfather, Kwohitsauq, or “Big Rumbling Belly.” After the death of his
    father he had been taken into the family of a white farmer, David Wilson, who had given him the name of Jack Wilson,
    by which he is commonly known among the whites. He thus has three distinct names, Wovoka, Kwohitsauq, and Jack
    Wilson. He stated positively that he was a full-blood, a statement borne out by his appearance. The impression that
    he is a half-blood may have arisen from the fact that his father’s name was “White Man” and that he has a white
    man’s name. His followers, both in his own and in all other tribes, commonly refer to him as “our father.” He has
    never been away from Mason valley and speaks only his own Paiute language, with some little knowledge of English. He
    is not acquainted with the sign language, which is hardly known west of the mountains.</p>

  <p>When about 20 years of age, he married, and continued to work for Mr Wilson. He had given the dance to his people
    about four years before, but had received his great revelation about two years previously. On this occasion “the sun
    died” (was eclipsed) and he fell asleep in the daytime and was taken up to the other world. Here he saw God, with
    all the people who had died long ago engaged in their oldtime sports and occupations, all happy and forever young.
    It was a pleasant land and full of game. After showing him all, God told him he must go <span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_772">772</span>back and tell his people they must be good and love one another, have no quarreling,
    and live in peace with the whites; that they must work, and not lie or steal; that they must put away all the old
    practices that savored of war; that if they faithfully obeyed his instructions they would at last be reunited with
    their friends in this other world, where there would be no more death or sickness or old age. He was then given the
    dance which he was commanded to bring back to his people. By performing this dance at intervals, for five
    consecutive days each time, they would secure this happiness to themselves and hasten the event. Finally God gave
    him control over the elements so that he could make it rain or snow or be dry at will, and appointed him his deputy
    to take charge of affairs in the west, while “Governor Harrison” would attend to matters in the east, and he, God,
    would look after the world above. He then returned to earth and began to preach as he was directed, convincing the
    people by exercising the wonderful powers that had been given him.</p>

  <p>In 1890 Josephus, a Paiute informant, thus described to the scout Chapman the occasion of Wovoka’s first
    inspiration: “About three years ago Jack Wilson took his family and went into the mountains to cut wood for Mr Dave
    Wilson. One day while at work he heard a great noise which appeared to be above him on the mountain. He laid down
    his ax and started to go in the direction of the noise, when he fell down dead, and God came and took him to
    heaven.” Afterward on one or two other occasions “God came and took him to heaven again.” Wovoka also told Chapman
    that he had then been preaching to the Indians about three years. In our conversation he said nothing about a
    mysterious noise, and stated that it was about two years since he had visited heaven and received his great
    revelation, but that it was about four years since he had first taught the dance to his people. The fact that he has
    different revelations from time to time would account for the discrepancy of statement.</p>

  <p>He disclaimed all responsibility for the ghost shirt which formed so important a part of the dance costume among
    the Sioux; said that there were no trances in the dance as performed among his people—a statement confirmed by
    eye-witnesses among the neighboring ranchmen—and earnestly repudiated any idea of hostility toward the whites,
    asserting that his religion was one of universal peace. When questioned directly, he said he believed it was better
    for the Indians to follow the white man’s road and to adopt the habits of civilization. If appearances are in
    evidence he is sincere in this, for he was dressed in a good suit of white man’s clothing, and works regularly on a
    ranch, although living in a wikiup. While he repudiated almost everything for which he had been held responsible in
    the east, he asserted positively that he had been to the spirit world and had been given a revelation and message
    from God himself, with full control over the elements. From his uncle I learned that Wovoka has five songs for
    making it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_773">773</span> rain, the first of which brings on a mist or cloud, the
    second a snowfall, the third a shower, and the fourth a hard rain or storm, while when he sings the fifth song the
    weather again becomes clear.</p>

  <p>I knew that he was holding something in reserve, as no Indian would unbosom himself on religious matters to a white
    man with whom he had not had a long and intimate acquaintance. Especially was this true in view of the warlike turn
    affairs had taken across the mountains. Consequently I accepted his statements with several grains of salt, but on
    the whole he seemed to be honest in his belief and his supernatural claims, although, like others of the priestly
    function, he occasionally resorts to cheap trickery to keep up the impression as to his miraculous powers. From some
    of the reports he is evidently an expert sleight-of-hand performer. He makes no claim to be Christ, the Son of God,
    as has been so often asserted in print. He does claim to be a prophet who has received a divine revelation. I could
    not help feeling that he was sincere in his repudiation of a number of the wonderful things attributed to him, for
    the reason that he insisted so strongly on other things fully as trying to the faith of a white man. He made no
    argument and advanced no proofs, but said simply that he had been with God, as though the statement no more admitted
    of controversy than the proposition that 2 and 2 are 4. From Mr J. O. Gregory, formerly employed at the agency, and
    well acquainted with the prophet, I learned that Wovoka had once requested him to draw up and forward to the
    President a statement of his supernatural claims, with a proposition that if he could receive a small regular
    stipend he would take up his residence on the reservation and agree to keep Nevada people informed of all the latest
    news from heaven and to furnish rain whenever wanted. The letter was never forwarded.</p>

  <p>From a neighboring ranchman, who knew Wovoka well and sometimes employed him in the working season, I obtained a
    statement which seems to explain the whole matter. It appears that a short time before the prophet began to preach
    he was stricken down by a severe fever, during which illness the ranchman frequently visited and ministered to him.
    While he was still sick there occurred an eclipse of the sun, a phenomenon which always excites great alarm among
    primitive peoples. In their system the sun is a living being, of great power and beneficence, and the temporary
    darkness is caused by an attack on him by some supernatural monster which endeavors to devour him, and will succeed,
    and thus plunge the world into eternal night unless driven off by incantations and loud noises. On this occasion the
    Paiute were frantic with excitement and the air was filled with the noise of shouts and wailings and the firing of
    guns, for the purpose of frightening off the monster that threatened the life of their god. It was now, as Wovoka
    stated, “when the sun died,” that he went to sleep in the daytime and was taken up to heaven. This means simply that
    the excitement and alarm produced by the eclipse, acting on a mind and body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_774">774</span>
    already enfeebled by sickness, resulted in delirium, in which he imagined himself to enter the portals
    of the spirit world. Constant dwelling on the subject in thought by day and in dreams by night would effect and
    perpetuate the exalted mental condition in which visions of the imagination would have all the seeming reality of
    actual occurrences. To those acquainted with the spiritual nature of Indians and their implicit faith in dreams all
    this is perfectly intelligible. His frequent trances would indicate also that, like so many other religious
    ecstatics, he is subject to cataleptic attacks.</p>

  <p>I have not been able to settle satisfactorily the date of this eclipse. From inquiry at the Nautical Almanac office
    I learn that solar eclipses visible in Nevada and the adjacent territory from 1884 to 1890 occurred as follows:
    1884, October 18, partial; 1885, March 16, partial; 1886, March 5, partial; 1887, none; 1888, none; 1889, January 1,
    total or partial; 1890, none. The total eclipse of January 1, 1889, agrees best with his statement to me on New
    Year’s night, 1892, that it was about two years since he had gone up to heaven when the sun died. It must be noted
    that Indians generally count years by winters instead of by series of twelve calendar months, a difference which
    sometimes makes an apparent discrepancy of nearly a year.</p>

  <p>In subsequent conversations he added a few minor details in regard to his vision and his doctrine. He asked many
    questions in regard to the eastern tribes whose delegates had visited him, and was pleased to learn that the
    delegates from several of these tribes were my friends. He spoke particularly of the large delegation—about twelve
    in number—from the Cheyenne and Arapaho, who had visited him the preceding summer and taken part in the dance with
    his people. Nearly all the members of this party were personally known to me, and the leader, Black Coyote, whose
    picture I had with me and showed to him, had been my principal instructor in the Ghost dance among the Arapaho.
    While this fact put me on a more confidential footing with Wovoka, it also proved of great assistance in my further
    investigation on my return to the prairie tribes, as, when they were satisfied from my statements and the specimens
    which I had brought back that I had indeed seen and talked with the messiah, they were convinced that I was
    earnestly desirous of understanding their religion aright, and from that time spoke freely and without reserve.</p>

  <p>I had my camera and was anxious to get Wovoka’s picture. When the subject was mentioned, he replied that his
    picture had never been made; that a white man had offered him five dollars for permission to take his photograph,
    but that he had refused. However, as I had been sent from Washington especially to learn and tell the whites all
    about him and his doctrine, and as he was satisfied from my acquaintance with his friends in the other tribes that I
    must be a good man, he would allow me to take his picture. As usual in dealing with Indians, he wanted to make the
    most of his bargain, and demanded two dollars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_775">775</span> and a half for the
    privilege of taking his picture and a like sum for each one of his family. I was prepared for this, however, and
    refused to pay any such charges, but agreed to give him my regular price per day for his services as informant and
    to send him a copy of the picture when finished. After some demur he consented and got ready for the operation by
    knotting a handkerchief about his neck, fastening an eagle feather at his right elbow, and taking a wide brim
    sombrero upon his knee. I afterward learned that the feather and sombrero were important parts of his spiritual
    stock in trade. After taking his picture I obtained from him, as souvenirs to bring back and show to my Indian
    friends in Indian Territory, a blanket of rabbit skins, some piñon nuts, some tail feathers of the magpie, highly
    prized by the Paiute for ornamentation, and some of the sacred red paint, endowed with most miraculous powers, which
    plays so important a part in the ritual of the Ghost-dance religion. Then, with mutual expressions of good will, we
    parted, his uncle going back to the reservation, while I took the train for Indian Territory.</p>

  <p>As soon as the news of my arrival went abroad among the Cheyenne and Arapaho on my return, my friends of both
    tribes came in, eager to hear all the details of my visit to the messiah and to get my own impressions of the man.
    In comparing notes with some of the recent delegates I discovered something of Wovoka’s hypnotic methods, and
    incidentally learned how much of miracle depends on the mental receptivity of the observer.</p>

  <p>The Cheyenne and Arapaho, although for generations associated in the most intimate manner, are of very different
    characters. In religious matters it may be said briefly that the Arapaho are devotees and prophets, continually
    seeing signs and wonders, while the Cheyenne are more skeptical. In talking with Tall Bull, one of the Cheyenne
    delegates and then captain of the Indian police, he said that before leaving they had asked Wovoka to give them some
    proof of his supernatural powers. Accordingly he had ranged them in front of him, seated on the ground, he sitting
    facing them, with his sombrero between and his eagle feathers in his hand. Then with a quick movement he had put his
    hand into the empty hat and drawn out from it “something black.” Tall Bull would not admit that anything more had
    happened, and did not seem to be very profoundly impressed by the occurrence, saying that he thought there were
    medicine-men of equal capacity among the Cheyenne. In talking soon afterward with Black Coyote, one of the Arapaho
    delegates and also a police officer, the same incident came up, but with a very different sequel. Black Coyote told
    how they had seated themselves on the ground in front of Wovoka, as described by Tall Bull, and went on to tell how
    the messiah had waved his feathers over his hat, and then, when he withdrew his hand, Black Coyote looked into the
    hat and there “saw the whole world.” The explanation is simple. Tall Bull, who has since been stricken with<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_776">776</span> paralysis, was a jovial, light-hearted fellow, fond of joking and
    playing tricks on his associates, but withal a man of good hard sense and disposed to be doubtful in regard to all
    medicine-men outside of his own tribe. Black Coyote, on the contrary, is a man of contemplative disposition, much
    given to speculation on the unseen world. His body and arms are covered with the scars of wounds which he has
    inflicted on himself in obedience to commands received in dreams. When the first news of the new religion came to
    the southern tribes, he had made a long journey, at his own expense, to his kindred in Wyoming, to learn the
    doctrine and the songs, and since his return had been drilling his people day and night in both. Now, on his visit
    to the fountain head of inspiration, he was prepared for great things, and when the messiah performed his hypnotic
    passes with the eagle feather, as I have so often witnessed in the Ghost dance, Black Coyote saw the whole spirit
    world where Tall Bull saw only an empty hat. From my knowledge of the men, I believe both were honest in their
    statements.</p>

  <p>As a result of the confidence established between the Indians and myself in consequence of my visit to the messiah,
    one of the Cheyenne delegates named Black Sharp Nose, a prominent man in his tribe, soon after voluntarily brought
    down to me the written statement of the doctrine obtained from the messiah himself, and requested me to take it back
    and show it to Washington, to convince the white people that there was nothing bad or hostile in the new religion.
    The paper had been written by a young Arapaho of the same delegation who had learned some English at the Carlisle
    Indian school, and it had been taken down on the spot from the dictation of the messiah as his message to be carried
    to the prairie tribes. On the reverse page of the paper the daughter of Black Sharp Nose, a young woman who had also
    some school education, had written out the same thing in somewhat better English from her father’s dictation on his
    return. No white man had any part, directly or indirectly, in its production, nor was it originally intended to be
    seen by white men. In fact, in one part the messiah himself expressly warns the delegates to tell no white man.</p>

      THE DOCTRINE OF THE GHOST DANCE</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="center subhead">You must not fight. &nbsp; &nbsp;Do no harm to anyone. &nbsp; &nbsp;Do right always.—<i>Wovoka.</i></div>

  <p>The great underlying principle of the Ghost dance doctrine is that the time will come when the whole Indian race,
    living and dead, will be reunited upon a regenerated earth, to live a life of aboriginal happiness, forever free
    from death, disease, and misery. On this foundation each tribe has built a structure from its own mythology, and
    each apostle and believer has filled in the details according to his own mental capacity or ideas of happiness, with
    such additions as come to him from the trance. Some changes, also, have undoubtedly resulted from the transmission
    of the doctrine through the imperfect medium of the sign language. The differences of interpretation are precisely
    such as we find in Christianity, with its hundreds of sects and innumerable shades of individual opinion. The white
    race, being alien and secondary and hardly real, has no part in this scheme of aboriginal regeneration, and will be
    left behind with the other things of earth that have served their temporary purpose, or else will cease entirely to
    exist.</p>

  <p>All this is to be brought about by an overruling spiritual power that needs no assistance from human creatures; and
    though certain medicine-men were disposed to anticipate the Indian millennium by preaching resistance to the further
    encroachments of the whites, such teachings form no part of the true doctrine, and it was only where chronic
    dissatisfaction was aggravated by recent grievances, as among the Sioux, that the movement assumed a hostile
    expression. On the contrary, all believers were exhorted to make themselves worthy of the predicted happiness by
    discarding all things warlike and practicing honesty, peace, and good will, not only among themselves, but also
    toward the whites, so long as they were together. Some apostles have even thought that all race distinctions are to
    be obliterated, and that the whites are to participate with the Indians in the coming felicity; but it seems
    unquestionable that this is equally contrary to the doctrine as originally preached.</p>

  <p>Different dates have been assigned at various times for the fulfillment of the prophecy. Whatever the year, it has
    generally been held, for very natural reasons, that the regeneration of the earth and the renewal of all life would
    occur in the early spring. In some cases July, and particularly the 4th of July, was the expected time. This, it may
    be noted, was about the season when the great annual ceremony of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_778">778</span>
    sun dance formerly took place among the prairie tribes. The messiah himself has set several dates from
    time to time, as one prediction after another failed to materialize, and in his message to the Cheyenne and Arapaho,
    in August, 1891, he leaves the whole matter an open question. The date universally recognized among all the tribes
    immediately prior to the Sioux outbreak was the spring of 1891. As springtime came and passed, and summer grew and
    waned, and autumn faded again into winter without the realization of their hopes and longings, the doctrine
    gradually assumed its present form—that some time in the unknown future the Indian will be united with his friends
    who have gone before, to be forever supremely happy, and that this happiness may be anticipated in dreams, if not
    actually hastened in reality, by earnest and frequent attendance on the sacred dance.</p>

  <p>On returning to the Cheyenne and Arapaho in Oklahoma, after my visit to Wovoka in January, 1892, I was at once
    sought by my friends of both tribes, anxious to hear the report of my journey and see the sacred things that I had
    brought back from the messiah. The Arapaho especially, who are of more spiritual nature than any of the other
    tribes, showed a deep interest and followed intently every detail of the narrative. As soon as the news of my return
    was spread abroad, men and women, in groups and singly, would come to me, and after grasping my hand would repeat a
    long and earnest prayer, sometimes aloud, sometimes with the lips silently moving, and frequently with tears rolling
    down the cheeks, and the whole body trembling violently from stress of emotion. Often before the prayer was ended
    the condition of the devotee bordered on the hysterical, very little less than in the Ghost dance itself. The
    substance of the prayer was usually an appeal to the messiah to hasten the coming of the promised happiness, with a
    petition that, as the speaker himself was unable to make the long journey, he might, by grasping the hand of one who
    had seen and talked with the messiah face to face, be enabled in his trance visions to catch a glimpse of the coming
    glory. During all this performance the bystanders awaiting their turn kept reverent silence. In a short time it
    became very embarrassing, but until the story had been told over and over again there was no way of escape without
    wounding their feelings. The same thing afterward happened among the northern Arapaho in Wyoming, one chief even
    holding out his hands toward me with short exclamations of <i>hŭ! hŭ! hŭ!</i> as is sometimes done by the devotees
    about a priest in the Ghost dance, in the hope, as he himself explained, that he might thus be enabled to go into a
    trance then and there. The hope, however, was not realized.</p>

  <p>After this preliminary ordeal my visitors would ask to see the things which I had brought back from the messiah—the
    rabbit-skin robes, the piñon nuts, the gaming sticks, the sacred magpie feathers, and, above all, the sacred red
    paint. This is a bright-red ocher, about the color of brick dust, which the Paiute procure from the
    neighborhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_779">779</span> of their sacred eminence, Mount Grant. It is ground,
    and by the help of water is made into elliptical cakes about 6 inches in length. It is the principal paint used by
    the Paiute in the Ghost dance, and small portions of it are given by the messiah to all the delegates and are
    carried back by them to their respective tribes, where it is mixed with larger quantities of their own red paint and
    used in decorating the faces of the participants in the dance, the painting being solemnly performed for each dancer
    by the medicine-man himself. It is believed to ward off sickness, to contribute to long life, and to assist the
    mental vision in the trance. On the battlefield of Wounded Knee I have seen this paint smeared on the posts of the
    inclosure about the trench in which are buried the Indians killed in the fight. I found it very hard to refuse the
    numerous requests for some of the paint, but as I had only one cake myself I could not afford to be too liberal. My
    friends were very anxious to touch it, however, but when I found that every man tried to rub off as much of it as
    possible on the palms of his hands, afterward smearing this dust on the faces of himself and his family, I was
    obliged in self-defense to put it entirely away.</p>

  <p>The piñon nuts, although not esteemed so sacred, were also the subject of reverent curiosity. One evening, by
    invitation from Left Hand, the principal chief of the Arapaho, I went over to his tipi to talk with him about the
    messiah and his country, and brought with me a quantity of the nuts for distribution. On entering I found the chief
    and a number of the principal men ranged on one side of the fire, while his wife and several other women, with his
    young grandchildren, completed the circle on the other. Each of the adults in turn took my hand with a prayer, as
    before described, varying in length and earnestness according to the devotion of the speaker. This ceremony consumed
    a considerable time. I then produced the piñon nuts and gave them to Left Hand, telling him how they were used as
    food by the Paiute. He handed a portion to his wife, and before I knew what was coming the two arose in their places
    and stretching out their hands toward the northwest, the country of the messiah, made a long and earnest prayer
    aloud that <i>Hesûnanin</i>, “Our Father,” would bless themselves and their children through the sacred food, and
    hasten the time of his coming. The others, men and women, listened with bowed heads, breaking in from time to time
    with similar appeals to “the Father.” The scene was deeply affecting. It was another of those impressive exhibitions
    of natural religion which it has been my fortune to witness among the Indians, and which throw light on a side of
    their character of which the ordinary white observer never dreams. After the prayer the nuts were carefully divided
    among those present, down to the youngest infant, that all might taste of what to them was the veritable bread of
    life.</p>

  <p>As I had always shown a sympathy for their ideas and feelings, and had now accomplished a long journey to the
    messiah himself at the cost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_780">780</span> of considerable difficulty and
    hardship, the Indians were at last fully satisfied that I was really desirous of learning the truth concerning their
    new religion. A few days after my visit to Left Hand, several of the delegates who had been sent out in the
    preceding August came down to see me, headed by Black Short Nose, a Cheyenne. After preliminary greetings, he stated
    that the Cheyenne and Arapaho were now convinced that I would tell the truth about their religion, and as they loved
    their religion and were anxious to have the whites know that it was all good and contained nothing bad or hostile
    they would now give me the message which the messiah himself had given to them, that I might take it back to show to
    Washington. He then took from a beaded pouch and gave to me a letter, which proved to be the message or statement of
    the doctrine delivered by Wovoka to the Cheyenne and Arapaho delegates, of whom Black Short Nose was one, on the
    occasion of their last visit to Nevada, in August, 1891, and written down on the spot, in broken English, by one of
    the Arapaho delegates, Casper Edson, a young man who had acquired some English education by several years’
    attendance at the government Indian school at Carlisle, Pennsylvania. On the reverse page of the paper was a
    duplicate in somewhat better English, written out by a daughter of Black Short Nose, a school girl, as dictated by
    her father on his return. These letters contained the message to be delivered to the two tribes, and as is expressly
    stated in the text were not intended to be seen by a white man. The daughter of Black Short Nose had attempted to
    erase this clause before her father brought the letter down to me, but the lines were still plainly visible. It is
    the genuine official statement of the Ghost-dance doctrine as given by the messiah himself to his disciples. It is
    reproduced here in duplicate and verbatim, just as received, with a translation for the benefit of those not
    accustomed to Carlisle English. In accordance with the request of the Indians, I brought the original to Washington,
    where it was read by the Indian Commissioner, Honorable T. J. Morgan, after which I had two copies made, giving one
    to the commissioner and retaining the other myself, returning the original to its owner, Black Short Nose.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_782">782</span></p>

  <p>Every organized religion has a system of ethics, a system of mythology, and a system of ritual observance. In this
    message from the high priest of the Ghost dance we have a synopsis of all three. With regard to the ritual part,
    ceremonial purification and bathing have formed a part in some form or other of every great religion from the
    beginning of history, while the religious dance dates back far beyond the day when the daughter of Saul “looked
    through a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord.” The feasting enjoined is a part of every
    Indian ceremonial gathering, religious, political, or social. The dance is to continue four successive nights, in
    accord with the regular Indian system, in which <i>four</i> is the sacred number, as <i>three</i> is in
    Christianity. In obedience to this message the southern prairie tribes, after the return of the delegation in
    August, 1891, ceased to hold frequent one-night dances at irregular intervals as formerly without the ceremonial
    bathing, and adopted instead a system of four-night dances at regular periods of six weeks, followed by ceremonial
    bathing on the morning of the fifth day.</p>

  <p>The mythology of the doctrine is only briefly indicated, but the principal articles are given. The dead are all
    arisen and the spirit hosts are advancing and have already arrived at the boundaries of this earth, led forward by
    the regenerator in shape of cloud-like indistinctness. The spirit captain of the dead is always represented under
    this shadowy semblance. The great change will be ushered in by a trembling of the earth, at which the faithful are
    exhorted to feel no alarm. The hope held out is the same that has inspired the Christian for nineteen centuries—a
    happy immortality in perpetual youth. As to fixing a date, the messiah is as cautious as his predecessor in
    prophecy, who declares that “no man knoweth the time, not even the angels of God.” His weather predictions also are
    about as definite as the inspired utterances of the Delphian oracle.</p>

  <p>The moral code inculcated is as pure and comprehensive in its simplicity as anything found in religious systems
    from the days of Gautama Buddha to the time of Jesus Christ. “<i>Do no harm to any one. Do right always.</i>” Could
    anything be more simple, and yet more exact and exacting? It inculcates honesty—“<i>Do not tell lies.</i>” It
    preaches good will—“<i>Do no harm to any one.</i>” It forbids the extravagant mourning customs formerly common among
    the tribes—“<i>When your friends die, you must not cry</i>,” which is interpreted by the prairie tribes as
    forbidding the killing of horses, the burning of tipis and destruction of property, the cutting off of the hair and
    the gashing of the body with knives, all of which were formerly the sickening rule at every death until forbidden by
    the new doctrine. As an Arapaho said to me when his little boy died, “I shall not shoot any ponies, and my wife will
    not gash her arms. We used to do this when our friends died, because we thought we would never see them again, and
    it made us feel bad. But now we know we shall all be united again.” If the Kiowa had held to<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_783">783</span> the Ghost-dance doctrine instead of abandoning it as they had done, they would have
    been spared the loss of thousands of dollars in horses, tipis, wagons, and other property destroyed, with much of
    the mental suffering and all of the physical laceration that resulted in consequence of the recent fatal epidemic in
    the tribe, when for weeks and months the sound of wailing went up night and morning, and in every camp men and women
    could be seen daily, with dress disordered and hair cut close to the scalp, with blood hardened in clots upon the
    skin, or streaming from mutilated fingers and fresh gashes on face, and arms, and legs. It preaches peace with the
    whites and obedience to authority until the day of deliverance shall come. Above all, it forbids war—“<i>You must
    not fight.</i>” It is hardly possible for us to realize the tremendous and radical change which this doctrine
    works in the whole spirit of savage life. The career of every Indian has been the warpath. His proudest title has
    been that of warrior. His conversation by day and his dreams by night have been of bloody deeds upon the enemies of
    his tribe. His highest boast was in the number of his scalp trophies, and his chief delight at home was in the war
    dance and the scalp dance. The thirst for blood and massacre seemed inborn in every man, woman, and child of every
    tribe. Now comes a prophet as a messenger from God to forbid not only war, but all that savors of war—the war dance,
    the scalp dance, and even the bloody torture of the sun dance—and his teaching is accepted and his words obeyed by
    four-fifths of all the warlike predatory tribes of the mountains and the great plains. Only those who have known the
    deadly hatred that once animated Ute, Cheyenne, and Pawnee, one toward another, and are able to contrast it with
    their present spirit of mutual brotherly love, can know what the Ghost-dance religion has accomplished in bringing
    the savage into civilization. It is such a revolution as comes but once in the life of a race.</p>

  <p>The beliefs held among the various tribes in regard to the final catastrophe are as fairly probable as some held on
    the same subject by more orthodox authorities. As to the dance itself, with its scenes of intense excitement,
    spasmodic action, and physical exhaustion even to unconsciousness, such manifestations have always accompanied
    religious upheavals among primitive peoples, and are not entirely unknown among ourselves. In a country which
    produces magnetic healers, shakers, trance mediums, and the like, all these things may very easily be paralleled
    without going far from home.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, we may say of the prophet and his doctrine what has been said of one of his apostles by a careful
    and competent investigator: “He has given these people a better religion than they ever had before, taught them

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_784">784</span></p>

  <p>We may now consider details of the doctrine as held by different tribes, beginning with the Paiute, among whom it
    originated. The best account of the Paiute belief is contained in a report to the War Department by Captain J. M.
    Lee, who was sent out in the autumn of 1890 to investigate the temper and fighting strength of the Paiute and other
    Indians in the vicinity of Fort Bidwell in northeastern California. We give the statement obtained by him from
    Captain Dick, a Paiute, as delivered one day in a conversational way and apparently without reserve, after nearly
    all the Indians had left the room:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Long time, twenty years ago, Indian medicine-man in Mason’s valley at Walker lake talk same way, same as you hear
      now. In one year, maybe, after he begin talk he die. Three years ago another medicine-man begin same talk. Heap
      talk all time. Indians hear all about it everywhere. Indians come from long way off to hear him. They come from
      the east; they make signs. Two years ago me go to Winnemucca and Pyramid lake, me see Indian Sam, a head man, and
      Johnson Sides. Sam he tell me he just been to see Indian medicine-man to hear him talk. Sam say medicine-man talk
      this way:</p>

    <p>“All Indians must dance, everywhere, keep on dancing. Pretty soon in next spring Big Man [Great Spirit] come. He
      bring back all game of every kind. The game be thick everywhere. All dead Indians come back and live again. They
      all be strong just like young men, be young again. Old blind Indian see again and get young and have fine time.
      When Old Man [God] comes this way, then all the Indians go to mountains, high up away from whites. Whites can’t
      hurt Indians then. Then while Indians way up high, big flood comes like water and all white people die, get
      drowned. After that water go way and then nobody but Indians everywhere and game all kinds thick. Then
      medicine-man tell Indians to send word to all Indians to keep up dancing and the good time will come. Indians who
      don’t dance, who don’t believe in this word, will grow little, just about a foot high, and stay that way. Some of
      them will be turned into wood and be burned in fire.” That’s the way Sam tell me the medicine-man talk. (<i><a href="#AGO">A. G. O.</a>, 6.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lieutenant N. P. Phister, who gathered a part of the material embodied in Captain Lee’s report, confirms this
    general statement and gives a few additional particulars. The flood is to consist of mingled mud and water, and when
    the faithful go up into the mountains, the skeptics will be left behind and will be turned to stone. The prophet
    claims to receive these revelations directly from God and the spirits of the dead Indians during his trances. He
    asserts also that he is invulnerable, and that if soldiers should attempt to kill him they would fall down as if
    they had no bones and die, while he would still live, even though cut into little pieces. (<i><a href="#Phister">Phister</a>, 3.</i>)</p>

  <p>One of the first and most prominent of those who brought the doctrine to the prairie tribes was Porcupine, a
    Cheyenne, who crossed the mountains with several companions in the fall of 1889, visited Wovoka, and attended the
    dance near Walker lake, Nevada. In his report of his experiences, made some months later to a military officer, he
    states that Wovoka claimed to be Christ himself, who had come back again, many centuries after his first rejection,
    in pity to teach his children. He quotes the prophet as saying:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I found my children were bad, so I went back to heaven and left them, I told them that in so many hundred years I
      would come back to see my children. At the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_785">785</span>end of this time I
      was sent back to try to teach them. My father told me the earth was getting old and worn out and the people
      getting bad, and that I was to renew everything as it used to be and make it better.</p>

    <p>He also told us that all our dead were to be resurrected; that they were all to come back to earth, and that, as
      the earth was too small for them and us, he would do away with heaven and make the earth itself large enough to
      contain us all; that we must tell all the people we met about these things. He spoke to us about fighting, and
      said that was bad and we must keep from it; that the earth was to be all good hereafter, and we must all be
      friends with one another. He said that in the fall of the year the youth of all good people would be renewed, so
      that nobody would be more than forty years old, and that if they behaved themselves well after this the youth of
      everyone would be renewed in the spring. He said if we were all good he would send people among us who could heal
      all our wounds and sickness by mere touch and that we would live forever. He told us not to quarrel or fight or
      strike each other, or shoot one another; that the whites and Indians were to be all one people. He said if any man
      disobeyed what he ordered his tribe would be wiped from the face of the earth; that we must believe everything he
      said, and we must not doubt him or say he lied; that if we did, he would know it; that he would know our thoughts
      and actions in no matter what part of the world we might be. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 5.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Here we have the statement that both races are to live together as one. We have also the doctrine of healing by
    touch. Whether or not this is an essential part of the system is questionable, but it is certain that the faithful
    believe that great physical good comes to them, to their children, and to the sick from the imposition of hands by
    the priests of the dance, apart from the ability thus conferred to see the things of the spiritual world.</p>

  <p>Another idea here presented, namely, that the earth becomes old and decrepit, and requires that its youth be
    renewed at the end of certain great cycles, is common to a number of tribes, and has an important place in the
    oldest religions of the world. As an Arapaho who spoke English expressed it, “This earth too old, grass too old,
    trees too old, our lives too old. Then all be new again.” Captain H. L. Scott also found among the southern plains
    tribes the same belief that the rivers, the mountains, and the earth itself are worn out and must be renewed,
    together with an indefinite idea that both races alike must die at the same time, to be resurrected in new but
    separate worlds.</p>

  <p>The Washo, Pit River, Bannock, and other tribes adjoining the Paiute on the north and west hold the doctrine
    substantially as taught by the messiah himself. We have but little light in regard to the belief as held by the
    Walapai, Cohonino, Mohave, and Navaho to the southward, beyond the general fact that the resurrection and return of
    the dead formed the principal tenet. As these tribes received their knowledge of the new religion directly from
    Paiute apostles, it is quite probable that they made but few changes in or additions to the original gospel.</p>

  <p>A witness of the dance among the Walapai in 1891 obtained from the leaders of the ceremony about the same statement
    of doctrine already mentioned as held by the Paiute, from whom also the Walapai had adopted many of the songs and
    ceremonial words used in connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_786">786</span> with the dance. They were
    then expecting the Indian redeemer to appear on earth some time within three or four years. They were particularly
    anxious to have it understood that their intentions were not hostile toward the whites and that they desired to live
    in peace with them until the redeemer came, but that then they would be unable to prevent their destruction even if
    they wished. (<i><a href="#JFL">J. F. L.</a>, 3.</i>)</p>

  <p>The manner of the final change and the destruction of the whites has been variously interpreted as the doctrine was
    carried from its original center. East of the mountains it is commonly held that a deep sleep will come on the
    believers, during which the great catastrophe will be accomplished, and the faithful will awake to immortality on a
    new earth. The Shoshoni of Wyoming say this sleep will continue four days and nights, and that on the morning of the
    fifth day all will open their eyes in a new world where both races will dwell together forever. The Cheyenne,
    Arapaho, Kiowa, and others, of Oklahoma, say that the new earth, with all the resurrected dead from the beginning,
    and with the buffalo, the elk, and other game upon it, will come from the west and slide over the surface of the
    present earth, as the right hand might slide over the left. As it approaches, the Indians will be carried upward and
    alight on it by the aid of the sacred dance feathers which they wear in their hair and which will act as wings to
    bear them up. They will then become unconscious for four days, and on waking out of their trance will find
    themselves with their former friends in the midst of all the oldtime surroundings. By Sitting Bull, the Arapaho
    apostle, it is thought that this new earth as it advances will be preceded by a wall of fire which will drive the
    whites across the water to their original and proper country, while the Indians will be enabled by means of the
    sacred feathers to surmount the flames and reach the promised land. When the expulsion of the whites has been
    accomplished, the fire will be extinguished by a rain continuing twelve days. By a few it is believed that a
    hurricane with thunder and lightning will come to destroy the whites alone. This last idea is said to be held also
    by the Walapai of Arizona, who extend its provisions to include the unbelieving Indians as well. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 6.</i>)
    The doctrine held by the Caddo, Wichita, and Delaware, of Oklahoma, is practically the same as is held by the
    Arapaho and Cheyenne from whom they obtained it. All these tribes believe that the destruction or removal of the
    whites is to be accomplished entirely by supernatural means, and they severely blame the Sioux for having provoked a
    physical conflict by their impatience instead of waiting for their God to deliver them in his own good time.</p>

  <p>Among all the tribes which have accepted the new faith it is held that frequent devout attendance on the dance
    conduces to ward off disease and restore the sick to health, this applying not only to the actual participants, but
    also to their children and friends. The idea of obtaining temporal blessings as the reward of a faithful
    performance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_787">787</span> of religious duties is too natural and universal to
    require comment. The purification by the sweat-bath, which forms an important preliminary to the dance among the
    Sioux, while devotional in its purpose, is probably also sanitary in its effect.</p>

  <p>Among the powerful and warlike Sioux of the Dakotas, already restless under both old and recent grievances, and
    more lately brought to the edge of starvation by a reduction of rations, the doctrine speedily assumed a hostile
    meaning and developed some peculiar features, for which reason it deserves particular notice as concerns this tribe.
    The earliest rumors of the new messiah came to the Sioux from the more western tribes in the winter of 1888–89, but
    the first definite account was brought by a delegation which crossed the mountains to visit the messiah in the fall
    of 1889, returning in the spring of 1890. On the report of these delegates the dance was at once inaugurated and
    spread so rapidly that in a few months the new religion had been accepted by the majority of the tribe.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the best statement of the Sioux version is given by the veteran agent, James McLaughlin, of Standing Rock
    agency. In an official letter of October 17, 1890, he writes that the Sioux, under the influence of Sitting Bull,
    were greatly excited over the near approach of a predicted Indian millennium or “return of the ghosts,” when the
    white man would be annihilated and the Indian again supreme, and which the medicine-men had promised was to occur as
    soon as the grass was green in the spring. They were told that the Great Spirit had sent upon them the dominant race
    to punish them for their sins, and that their sins were now expiated and the time of deliverance was at hand. Their
    decimated ranks were to be reinforced by all the Indians who had ever died, and these spirits were already on their
    way to reinhabit the earth, which had originally belonged to the Indians, and were driving before them, as they
    advanced, immense herds of buffalo and fine ponies. The Great Spirit, who had so long deserted his red children, was
    now once more with them and against the whites, and the white man’s gunpowder would no longer have power to drive a
    bullet through the skin of an Indian. The whites themselves would soon be overwhelmed and smothered under a deep
    landslide, held down by sod and timber, and the few who might escape would become small fishes in the rivers. In
    order to bring about this happy result, the Indians must believe and organize the Ghost dance.</p>

  <p>The agent continues:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It would seem impossible that any person, no matter how ignorant, could be brought to believe such absurd
      nonsense, but as a matter of fact a great many Indians of this agency actually believe it, and since this new
      doctrine has been ingrafted here from the more southern Sioux agencies the infection has been wonderful, and so
      pernicious that it now includes some of the Indians who were formerly numbered with the progressive and more
      intelligent, and many of our very best Indians appear dazed and undecided when talking of it, their inherent
      superstition having been thoroughly aroused. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 7.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_788">788</span></p>

  <p>The following extract is from a translation of a letter dated March 30, 1891, written in Sioux by an Indian at Pine
    Ridge to a friend at Rosebud agency:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>And now I will tell another thing. Lately there is a man died and come to life again, and he say he has been to
      Indian nation of ghosts, and tells us dead Indian nation all coming home. The Indian ghost tell him come after his
      war bonnet. The Indian (not ghost Indian) gave him his war bonnet and he died again. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 8.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Sioux, like other tribes, believed that at the moment of the catastrophe the earth would tremble. According to
    one version the landslide was to be accompanied by a flood of water, which would flow into the mouths of the whites
    and cause them to choke with mud. Storms and whirlwinds were also to assist in their destruction. The Indians were
    to surmount the avalanche, probably in the manner described in speaking of the southern tribes, and on reaching the
    surface of the new earth would behold boundless prairies covered with long grass and filled with great herds of
    buffalo and other game. When the time was near at hand, they must assemble at certain places of rendezvous and
    prepare for the final abandonment of all earthly things by stripping off their clothing. In accordance with the
    general idea of a return to aboriginal habits, the believers, as far as possible, discarded white man’s dress and
    utensils. Those who could procure buckskin—which is now very scarce in the Sioux country—resumed buckskin dress,
    while the dancers put on “ghost shirts” made of cloth, but cut and ornamented in Indian fashion. No metal of any
    kind was allowed in the dance, no knives, and not even the earrings or belts of imitation silver which form such an
    important part of prairie Indian costume. This was at variance with the custom among the Cheyenne and other southern
    tribes, where the women always wear in the dance their finest belts studded with large disks of German silver. The
    beads used so freely on moccasins and leggings seem to have been regarded as a substitute for the oldtime wampum and
    porcupine quill work, and were therefore not included in the prohibition. No weapon of any kind was allowed to be
    carried in the Ghost dance by any tribe, north or south, a fact which effectually disposes of the assertion that
    this was another variety of war dance. At certain of the Sioux dances, however, sacred arrows and a sacred bow, with
    other things, were tied on the tree in the center of the circle.</p>

    <p>The originals of these ghost shirts, now in the National Museum, were taken, by scouts present during the fight,

  <p class="p2">Valuable light in regard to the Sioux version of the doctrine is obtained from the sermon delivered at Red Leaf
    camp, on Pine Ridge reservation, October 31, 1890, by Short Bull, one of those who had been selected to visit the
    messiah, and who afterward became one of the prime leaders in the dance:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>My friends and relations: I will soon start this thing in running order. I have told you that this would come to
      pass in two seasons, but since the whites are interfering so much, I will advance the time from what my father
      above told me to do, so the time will be shorter. Therefore you must not be afraid of anything. Some of my
      relations have no ears, so I will have them blown away.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_789">789</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Now, there will be a tree sprout up, and there all the members of our religion and the tribe must gather
      together. That will be the place where we will see our dead relations. But before this time we must dance the
      balance of this moon, at the end of which time the earth will shiver very hard. Whenever this thing occurs, I will
      start the wind to blow. We are the ones who will then see our fathers, mothers, and everybody. We, the tribe of
      Indians, are the ones who are living a sacred life. God, our father himself, has told and commanded and shown me
      to do these things.</p>

    <p>Our father in heaven has placed a mark at each point of the four winds. First, a clay pipe, which lies at the
      setting of the sun and represents the Sioux tribe. Second, there is a holy arrow lying at the north, which
      represents the Cheyenne tribe. Third, at the rising of the sun there lies hail, representing the Arapaho tribe.
      Fourth, there lies a pipe and nice feather at the south, which represents the Crow tribe. My father has shown me
      these things, therefore we must continue this dance. If the soldiers surround you four deep, three of you, on whom
      I have put holy shirts, will sing a song, which I have taught you, around them, when some of them will drop dead.
      Then the rest will start to run, but their horses will sink into the earth. The riders will jump from their
      horses, but they will sink into the earth also. Then you can do as you desire with them. Now, you must know this,
      that all the soldiers and that race will be dead. There will be only five thousand of them left living on the
      earth. My friends and relations, this is straight and true.</p>

    <p>Now, we must gather at Pass creek where the tree is sprouting. There we will go among our dead relations. You
      must not take any earthly things with you. Then the men must take off all their clothing and the women must do the
      same. No one shall be ashamed of exposing their persons. My father above has told us to do this, and we must do as
      he says. You must not be afraid of anything. The guns are the only things we are afraid of, but they belong to our
      father in heaven. He will see that they do no harm. Whatever white men may tell you, do not listen to them, my
      relations. This is all. I will now raise my hand up to my father and close what he has said to you through me.

  </blockquote>

  <p>The pipe here referred to is the most sacred thing in Sioux mythology and will be more fully described in treating
    of the Sioux songs. The sacred object of the Cheyenne is the “medicine arrow,” now in the keeping of the band living
    near Cantonment, Oklahoma. The Crow and Arapaho references are not so clear. The Arapaho are called by the Sioux the
    “Blue Cloud” people, a name which may possibly have some connection with hail. The sprouting tree at which all the
    believers must gather refers to the tree or pole which the Sioux planted in the center of the dance circle. The
    cardinal directions here assigned to the other tribes may refer to their former locations with regard to the Sioux.
    The Cheyenne and Arapaho, who now live far west and south of the Sioux, originally lived north and east of them,
    about Red river and the Saskatchewan.</p>

  <p>The most noted thing connected with the Ghost dance among the Sioux is the “ghost shirt” which was worn by all
    adherents of the doctrine—men, women, and children alike. It is described by Captain Sword in his account of the
    Ghost dance, given in the appendix to this chapter, and will be noticed at length hereafter in treating of the
    ceremony of the dance. During the dance it was worn as an outside garment, but was said to be worn at other times
    under the ordinary dress. Although the shape, fringing, and feather adornment were practically the same in every
    case, considerable variation existed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_790">790</span> regard to the painting,
    the designs on some being very simple, while the others were fairly covered with representations of sun, moon,
    stars, the sacred things of their mythology, and the visions of the trance. The feathers attached to the garment
    were always those of the eagle, and the thread used in the sewing was always the old-time sinew. In some cases the
    fringe or other portions were painted with the sacred red paint of the messiah. The shirt was firmly believed to be
    impenetrable to bullets or weapons of any sort. When one of the women shot in the Wounded Knee massacre was
    approached as she lay in the church and told that she must let them remove her ghost shirt in order the better to
    get at her wound, she replied: “Yes; take it off. They told me a bullet would not go through. Now I don’t want it
    any more.”</p>

  <p>The protective idea in connection with the ghost shirt does not seem to be aboriginal. The Indian warrior
    habitually went into battle naked above the waist. His protecting “medicine” was a feather, a tiny bag of some
    sacred powder, the claw of an animal, the head of a bird, or some other small object which could be readily twisted
    into his hair or hidden between the covers of his shield without attracting attention. Its virtue depended entirely
    on the ceremony of the consecration and not on size or texture. The war paint had the same magic power of
    protection. To cover the body in battle was not in accordance with Indian usage, which demanded that the warrior
    should be as free and unincumbered in movement as possible. The so-called “war shirt” was worn chiefly in ceremonial
    dress parades and only rarely on the warpath.</p>

  <p>Dreams are but incoherent combinations of waking ideas, and there is a hint of recollection even in the wildest
    visions of sleep. The ghost shirt may easily have been an inspiration from a trance, while the trance vision itself
    was the result of ideas derived from previous observation or report. The author is strongly inclined to the opinion
    that the idea of an invulnerable sacred garment is not original with the Indians, but, like several other important
    points pertaining to the Ghost-dance doctrine, is a practical adaptation by them of ideas derived from contact with
    some sectarian body among the whites. It may have been suggested by the “endowment robe” of the Mormons, a seamless
    garment of white muslin adorned with symbolic figures, which is worn by their initiates as the most sacred badge of
    their faith, and by many of the believers is supposed to render the wearer invulnerable. The Mormons have always
    manifested a particular interest in the Indians, whom they regard as the Lamanites of their sacred writings, and
    hence have made special efforts for their evangelization, with the result that a considerable number of the
    neighboring tribes of Ute, Paiute, Bannock, and Shoshoni have been received into the Mormon church and invested with
    the endowment robe. (See the appendix to this chapter: “The Mormons and the Indians;” also “Tell It All,” by Mrs T.
    B. H. Stenhouse.) The Shoshoni and northern Arapaho occupy the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_791">791</span>
    reservation in Wyoming, and anything which concerns one tribe is more or less talked of by the other.
    As the Sioux, Cheyenne, and other eastern tribes make frequent visits to the Arapaho, and as these Arapaho have been
    the great apostles of the Ghost dance, it is easy to see how an idea borrowed by the Shoshoni from the Mormons could
    find its way through the Arapaho first to the Sioux and Cheyenne and afterward to more remote tribes. Wovoka himself
    expressly disclaimed any responsibility for the ghost shirt, and whites and Indians alike agreed that it formed no
    part of the dance costume in Mason valley. When I first went among the Cheyenne and neighboring tribes of Oklahoma
    in January, 1891, the ghost shirt had not yet reached them. Soon afterward the first one was brought down from the
    Sioux country by a Cheyenne named White Buffalo, who had been a Carlisle student, but the Arapaho and Cheyenne,
    after debating the matter, refused to allow it to be worn in the dance, on the ground that the doctrine of the Ghost
    dance was one of peace, whereas the Sioux had made the ghost shirt an auxiliary of war. In consequence of this
    decision such shirts have never been worn by the dancers among the southern tribes. Instead they wear in the dance
    their finest shirts and dresses of buckskin, covered with painted and beaded figures from the Ghost-dance mythology
    and the visions of the trance.</p>

  <p>The Ghost dance is variously named among the different tribes. In its original home among the Paiute it is called
    <i>Nänigükwa</i>, “dance in a circle” (<i>nüka</i>, dance), to distinguish it from the other dances of the tribe,
    which have only the ordinary up-and-down step without the circular movement. The Shoshoni call it <i>Tänä′räyün</i>
    or <i>Tämanä′rayära</i>, which may be rendered “everybody dragging,” in allusion to the manner in which the dancers
    move around the circle holding hands, as children do in their ring games. They insist that it is a revival of a
    similar dance which existed among them fifty years ago. The Comanche call it <i>A′p-anĕka′ra</i>, “the Father’s
    dance,” or sometimes the dance “with joined hands.” The Kiowa call it <i>Mânposo′ti guan</i>, “dance with clasped
    hands,” and the frenzy, <i>guan â′dalka-i</i>, “dance craziness.” The Caddo know it as <i>Ă′ă kakĭ′mbawi′ut</i>,
    “the prayer of all to the Father,” or as the <i>Nänisana ka-au′-shan</i>, “nänisana dance,” from <i>nänisana</i>,
    “my children,” which forms the burden of so many of the ghost songs in the language of the Arapaho, from whom they
    obtained the dance. By the Sioux, Arapaho, and most other prairie tribes it is called the “spirit” or “ghost” dance
    (Sioux, <i>Wana′ghi wa′chipi</i>; Arapaho, <i>Thigû′nawat</i>), from, the fact that everything connected with it
    relates to the coming of the spirits of the dead from the spirit world, and by this name it has become known among
    the whites.</p>

  <h3 id="Appendix_X">APPENDIX</h3>

  <h4 id="Mormons_and_the_Indians">THE MORMONS AND THE INDIANS</h4>

  <p>While the Indian excitement was at its height in 1892, a curious pamphlet was published anonymously at Salt Lake
    City in connection with a proposed series of lectures, from which we make some extracts for the light they give on
    the Mormon attitude toward the Indians. The pamphlet is headed, “The Mormons have stepped down and out of Celestial
    Government—the American Indians have stepped up and into Celestial Government.” It begins by stating that the
    Messiah came to His people at the time appointed of the Father—March, 1890—notwithstanding the assertion in the
    Deseret Evening News, made January, 1892: “1890 has passed, and no Messiah has come.” It goes on to say:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“1891 has passed, and no pruning of the vineyard.” The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.—Isa. 5:7. In
      the part of the vineyard the American Indians, descendants of the righteous branch of Joseph, who were led to the
      Western Continent or hemisphere—Zion—we find the vine, the stone-power of the Latter Days. Ps. 80.</p>

    <p>The celestial prophet, seer, and revelator, Joseph Smith, jr., prophesied on the 2d of April, 1843, that the
      Messiah would reveal himself to man in mortality in 1890. Doctrine and Covenants, 130, 15, 17, which reads: “I was
      once praying very earnestly to know the time of the coming of the Son of Man, when I heard a voice speak the
      following: ‘Joseph, my son, if thou livest until thou art eighty-five years old, thou shalt see the face of the
      Son of Man.’”</p>

    <div class="center">*<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span></div>

    <p>Five years later (than 1882) the sign that was to usher in the work of the Father was given to the American
      Indians, while March, 1890, witnesses the organization of a church under the restored order, where twelve
      disciples were chosen and ordained, whose first allegiance is given irrevocably to the Lord God, whereas that of
      the Celestial Church is given to the government fostering it.</p>

    <div class="center">*<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span></div>

    <p>The following seven signs were to precede the fullness of the Gentiles upon the land of America; Zion, the time,
      place, and parties given with each. [The first, second, and third “signs” are omitted here.]</p>

    <p>4. When the Bible and Book of Mormon become one in the hands of the Messiah. Ezk. 37:19; III Nephi, 21:1–7. In
      1887, sixty years after the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, jr., the Book of Mormon in Spanish was
      delivered to the American Indians, with the promise to those who are identified with the Gentiles that if they
      will not harden their hearts, but will repent and know the true points of my doctrine they shall be numbered with
      my covenant people, the Branch of Joseph. Doctrine and Covenant, 19:59–62; 20:8–17; III Nephi, 21:1–7.</p>

    <p>5. The coming of the Messiah. Three years later, March, 1890, the people of God, who were notified by the three
      Nephites, met at Walkers lake, Esmeralda county, Nevada, where a dispensation of the Celestial kingdom of God—the
      gospel in the covenant of consecration, a perfect oneness in all things, temporal and spiritual—was given unto
      them. Twelve disciples were ordained, not by angels or men, but by the Messiah, in the presence of hundreds,
      representing scores of tribes or nations, who saw his face, heard and understood his voice as on the day of
      pentecost. Acts 2, also fulfilling sec. 90:9, 10, 11 of Doctrine and Covenant. Ezk. 20:33–37.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_793">793</span></p>

    <p>6. The Fulness of the Gentiles. In 1492, the Lord God let His vineyard to the nations of the Gentiles, to punish
      His people the Branch of Joseph for 400 years (Gen. 15:13), bringing the fulness of the Gentiles the end of their
      rule over the American Indians. October, 1892, Rom. II: 25–26; Gen. 50:25; New Trans. Matt. 21:33–41.</p>

    <p>7. The Pruning of the Vineyard. The husbandmen upon this land began the last pruning of the vineyard in 1891.
      Prominent among which stands our government in fulfilling Matt. 21:33–41, saying, let us kill the heirs and hold
      the inheritance, as shown in the massacre of Wounded Knee; the butchery of Sitting Bull; the imprisonment of Short
      Bull and others; the breaking up of reservations, and the attempts to destroy the treaty stipulations above
      mentioned by forcing the mark of the Beast, citizenship and statehood, upon the American Indians, which will
      ultimately terminate in a war of extermination. Isa. 10:24–27; Dan. 2:34; Isa. 14:21.</p>

    <p>According to the astronomical, prophetic, and historical evidence found in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and
      Doctrine and Covenants for the redemption of Zion and the restoration of Israel, there are seven celestial keys of
      powers to be used which can not be handled by apostles, prophets, or angels. They can only be handled by the
      Messiah and his Father.</p>

    <div class="center">*<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span></div>

    <p>2. The key of power that restores the heirs, the American Indians, to their own lands consecrating to them the
      wealth of the Gentiles.</p>

    <p>3. The key of power that turns away ungodliness from Jacob (the American Indians) enabling them to build the
      temple on the spot pointed out by the finger of God (Independence, Jackson County, Missouri), on which the true
      sign of Israel is to rest, the glory of the living God of the Hebrews, the cloud by day and the pillar of fire by
      night by the close of this generation, 1896.</p>

    <div class="center">*<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span></div>

    <p>On and after July 10, 1892, free lectures illustrated by figures, will be given weekly, on Sunday, Monday, and
      Tuesday, from 6.30 to 8.30 p. m. (weather permitting), at the book stand in the Nineteenth Ward, opposite
      Margett’s Brewery, No. 312 North Second West.</p>

    <p>First. On the coming of the Messiah to the Hebrews, at the sacrifice of Esau, near the close of the 400-year
      bondage of Jacob in the morning of the Abrahamic Covenant, B. C. 1491.</p>

    <p>Second. On the coming of the Messiah to the Jews, at the Meridian sacrifice of Jacob at the close of the last
      1921 years of the covenant, the year one A. D.</p>

    <p>Third. On the coming of the Messiah to the American Indians, the remnants, at the evening sacrifice of Esau, near
      the expiration of the evening bondage of Jacob of 400 years, 1892, in the last 430 years of the covenant.</p>

  <h4 id="Porcupines_account">PORCUPINE’S ACCOUNT OF THE MESSIAH</h4>

  <p>The following statement was made to Major Carroll, in command of Camp Crook, at Tongue River agency, Montana, June
    15, 1890, and transmitted through the War Department to the Indian Office:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In November last [1889] I left the reservation with two other Cheyennes. I went through [Fort] Washakie and took
      the Union Pacific railroad at Rawlins. We got on early in the morning about breakfast, rode all day on the
      railroad, and about dark reached a fort [Bridger?]. I stayed there two days, and then took a passenger train, and
      the next morning got to Fort Hall. I found some lodges of Snakes and Bannocks there. I saw the agent here, and he
      told me I could stay at the agency, but the chief of the Bannocks who was there took me to his camp near by. The
      Bannocks told me they were glad to see a Cheyenne and that we ought to make a treaty with the Bannocks.</p>

    <p>The chief told me he had been to Washington and had seen the President, and that we ought all to be friends with
      the whites and live at peace with them and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_794">794</span>with each other. We
      talked these matters over for ten days. The agent then sent for me and some of the Bannocks and Shoshones, and
      asked me where I was going. I told him I was just traveling to meet other Indians and see other countries; that my
      people were at peace with the whites, and I thought I could travel anywhere I wished. He asked me why I did not
      have a pass. I said because my agent would not give me one. He said he was glad to see me anyhow, and that the
      whites and Indians were all friends. Then he asked me where I wanted a pass to. I told him I wanted to go further
      and some Bannocks and Shoshones wanted to go along. He gave passes—five of them—to the chiefs of the three
      parties. We took the railroad to a little town near by, and then took a narrow-gauge road. We went on this, riding
      all night at a very fast rate of speed, and came to a town on a big lake [Ogden or Salt Lake City]. We stayed
      there one day, taking the cars at night, rode all night, and the next morning about 9 oclock saw a settlement of
      Indians. We traveled south, going on a narrow-gauge road. We got off at this Indian town. The Indians here were
      different from any Indians I ever saw. The women and men were dressed in white people’s clothes, the women having
      their hair banged. These Indians had their faces painted white with black spots. We stayed with these people all
      day. We took the same road at night and kept on. We traveled all night, and about daylight we saw a lot of houses,
      and they told us there were a lot more Indians there; so we got off, and there is where we saw Indians living in
      huts of grass [tulé?]. We stopped here and got something to eat. There were whites living near by. We got on the
      cars again at night, and during the night we got off among some Indians, who were fish-eaters [Paiute]. We stayed
      among the Fish-eaters till morning, and then got into a wagon with the son of the chief of the Fish-eaters, and we
      arrived about noon at an agency on a big river. There was also a big lake near the agency.</p>

    <p>The agent asked us where we were from and said we were a long ways from home, and that he would write to our
      agent and let him know we were all right. From this agency we went back to the station, and they told us there
      were some more Indians to the south. One of the chiefs of the Fish-eaters then furnished us with four wagons. We
      traveled all day, and then came to another railroad. We left our wagons here and took the railroad, the
      Fish-eaters telling us there were some more Indians along the railroad who wanted to see us. We took this railroad
      about 2 oclock and about sun down got to another agency, where there were more Fish-eaters. [From diagrams drawn
      and explanations given of them in addition to the foregoing, there seems to be no doubt that the lakes visited are
      Pyramid and Walker lakes, western Nevada, and the agencies those of the same name.]</p>

    <p>They told us they had heard from the Shoshone agency that the people in this country were all bad people, but
      that they were good people there. All the Indians from the Bannock agency down to where I finally stopped danced
      this dance [referring to the late religious dances at the Cheyenne agency], the whites often dancing it
      themselves. [It will be recollected that he traveled constantly through the Mormon country.] I knew nothing about
      this dance before going. I happened to run across it, that is all. I will tell you about it. [Here all the Indian
      auditors removed their hats in token that the talk to follow was to be on a religious subject.] I want you all to
      listen to this, so that there will be no mistake. There is no harm in what I am to say to anyone. I heard this
      where I met my friends in Nevada. It is a wonder you people never heard this before. In the dance we had there
      [Nevada] the whites and Indians danced together. I met there a great many kinds of people, but they all seemed to
      know all about this religion. The people there seemed all to be good. I never saw any drinking or fighting or bad
      conduct among them. They treated me well on the cars, without pay. They gave me food without charge, and I found
      that this was a habit among them toward their neighbors. I thought it strange that the people there should have
      been so good, so different from those here.</p>

    <p>What I am going to say is the truth. The two men sitting near me were with me, and will bear witness that I speak
      the truth. I and my people have been living in ignorance until I went and found out the truth. All the whites and
      Indians are brothers, I was told there. I never knew this before.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_795">795</span></p>

    <p>The Fish-eaters near Pyramid lake told me that Christ had appeared on earth again. They said Christ knew he was
      coming; that eleven of his children were also coming from a far land. It appeared that Christ had sent for me to
      go there, and that was why unconsciously I took my journey. It had been foreordained. Christ had summoned myself
      and others from all heathen tribes, from two to three or four from each of fifteen or sixteen different tribes.
      There were more different languages than I ever heard before and I did not understand any of them. They told me
      when I got there that my great father was there also, but did not know who he was. The people assembled called a
      council, and the chief’s son went to see the Great Father [messiah], who sent word to us to remain fourteen days
      in that camp and that he would come to see us. He sent me a small package of something white to eat that I did not
      know the name of. There were a great many people in the council, and this white food was divided among them. The
      food was a big white nut. Then I went to the agency at Walker lake and they told us Christ would be there in two
      days. At the end of two days, on the third morning, hundreds of people gathered at this place. They cleared off a
      place near the agency in the form of a circus ring and we all gathered there. This space was perfectly cleared of
      grass, etc. We waited there till late in the evening anxious to see Christ. Just before sundown I saw a great many
      people, mostly Indians, coming dressed in white men’s clothes. The Christ was with them. They all formed in this
      ring around it. They put up sheets all around the circle, as they had no tents. Just after dark some of the
      Indians told me that the Christ [Father] was arrived. I looked around to find him, and finally saw him sitting on
      one side of the ring. They all started toward him to see him. They made a big fire to throw light on him. I never
      looked around, but went forward, and when I saw him I bent my head. I had always thought the Great Father was a
      white man, but this man looked like an Indian. He sat there a long time and nobody went up to speak to him. He sat
      with his head bowed all the time. After awhile he rose and said he was very glad to see his children. “I have sent
      for you and am glad to see you. I am going to talk to you after awhile about your relatives who are dead and gone.
      My children, I want you to listen to all I have to say to you. I will teach you, too, how to dance a dance, and I
      want you to dance it. Get ready for your dance and then, when the dance is over, I will talk to you.” He was
      dressed in a white coat with stripes. The rest of his dress was a white man’s except that he had on a pair of
      moccasins. Then he commenced our dance, everybody joining in, the Christ singing while we danced. We danced till
      late in the night, when he told us we had danced enough.</p>

    <p>The next morning, after breakfast was over, we went into the circle and spread canvas over it on the ground, the
      Christ standing in the midst of us. He told us he was going away that day, but would be back that next morning and
      talk to us.</p>

    <p>In the night when I first saw him I thought he was an Indian, but the next day when I could see better he looked
      different. He was not so dark as an Indian, nor so light as a white man. He had no beard or whiskers, but very
      heavy eyebrows. He was a good-looking man. We were crowded up very close. We had been told that nobody was to
      talk, and even if we whispered the Christ would know it. I had heard that Christ had been crucified, and I looked
      to see, and I saw a scar on his wrist and one on his face, and he seemed to be the man. I could not see his feet.
      He would talk to us all day.</p>

    <p>That evening we all assembled again to see him depart. When we were assembled, he began to sing, and he commenced
      to tremble all over, violently for a while, and then sat down. We danced all that night, the Christ lying down
      beside us apparently dead.</p>

    <p>The next morning when we went to eat breakfast, the Christ was with us. After breakfast four heralds went around
      and called out that the Christ was back with us and wanted to talk with us. The circle was prepared again. The
      people assembled, and Christ came among us and sat down. He said he wanted to talk to us again and for us to
      listen. He said: “I am the man who made everything you see around you. I am not lying to you, my children. I made
      this earth and everything on it. I have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_796">796</span>been to heaven and seen
      your dead friends and have seen my own father and mother. In the beginning, after God made the earth, they sent me
      back to teach the people, and when I came back on earth the people were afraid of me and treated me badly. This is
      what they did to me [showing his scars]. I did not try to defend myself. I found my children were bad, so went
      back to heaven and left them. I told them that in so many hundred years I would come back to see my children. At
      the end of this time I was sent back to try to teach them. My father told me the earth was getting old and worn
      out, and the people getting bad, and that I was to renew everything as it used to be, and make it better.”</p>

    <p>He told us also that all our dead were to be resurrected; that they were all to come back to earth, and that as
      the earth was too small for them and us, he would do away with heaven, and make the earth itself large enough to
      contain us all; that we must tell all the people we meet about these things. He spoke to us about fighting, and
      said that was bad, and we must keep from it; that the earth was to be all good hereafter, and we must all be
      friends with one another. He said that in the fall of the year the youth of all the good people would be renewed,
      so that nobody would be more than 40 years old, and that if they behaved themselves well after this the youth of
      everyone would be renewed in the spring. He said if we were all good he would send people among us who could heal
      all our wounds and sickness by mere touch, and that we would live forever. He told us not to quarrel, or fight,
      nor strike each other, nor shoot one another; that the whites and Indians were to be all one people. He said if
      any man disobeyed what he ordered, his tribe would be wiped from the face of the earth; that we must believe
      everything he said, and that we must not doubt him, or say he lied; that if we did, he would know it; that he
      would know our thoughts and actions, in no matter what part of the world we might be.</p>

    <p>When I heard this from the Christ, and came back home to tell it to my people, I thought they would listen. Where
      I went to there were lots of white people, but I never had one of them say an unkind word to me. I thought all of
      your people knew all of this I have told you of, but it seems you do not.</p>

    <p>Ever since the Christ I speak of talked to me I have thought what he said was good. I see nothing bad in it. When
      I got back, I knew my people were bad, and had heard nothing of all this, so I got them together and told them of
      it and warned them to listen to it for their own good. I talked to them for four nights and five days. I told them
      just what I have told you here today. I told them what I said were the words of God Almighty, who was looking down
      on them. I wish some of you had been up in our camp here to have heard my words to the Cheyennes. The only bad
      thing that there has been in it at all was this: I had just told my people that the Christ would visit the sins of
      any Indian upon the whole tribe, when the recent trouble [killing of Ferguson] occurred. If any one of you think I
      am not telling the truth, you can go and see this man I speak of for yourselves. I will go with you, and I would
      like one or two of my people who doubt me to go with me.</p>

    <p>The Christ talked to us all in our respective tongues. You can see this man in your sleep any time you want after
      you have seen him and shaken hands with him once. Through him you can go to heaven and meet your friends. Since my
      return I have seen him often in my sleep. About the time the soldiers went up the Rosebud I was lying in my lodge
      asleep, when this man appeared and told me that the Indians had gotten into trouble, and I was frightened. The
      next night he appeared to me and told me that everything would come out all right.</p>

  <h4 id="Ghost_dance_among_the_Sioux">THE GHOST DANCE AMONG THE SIOUX</h4>

  <p>The following was written originally in the Teton Dakota dialect by George Sword, an Ogalala Sioux Indian, formerly
    captain of the Indian police at Pine Ridge agency and now judge of the Indian court. It<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_797">797</span> was translated by an Indian for Miss Emma C. Sickels and is published by her
    courtesy. The copy of the original Sioux manuscript is in the archives of the Bureau of Ethnology:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In the story of ghost dancing, the Ogalala heard that the Son of God was truly on earth in the west from their
      country. This was in the year 1889. The first people knew about the messiah to be on earth were the Shoshoni and
      Arapaho. So in 1889 Good Thunder with four or five others visited the place where Son of God said to be. These
      people went there without permission. They said the messiah was there at the place, but he was there to help the
      Indians and not the whites; so this made the Indians happy to find out this. Good Thunder, Cloud Horse, Yellow
      Knife, and Short Bull visited the place again in 1890 and saw the messiah. Their story of visit to the messiah is
      as follows:</p>

    <p>“From the country where the Arapaho and Shoshoni we start in the direction of northwest in train for five nights
      and arrived at the foot of the Rocky mountains. Here we saw him and also several tribes of Indians. The people
      said that the messiah will come at a place in the woods where the place was prepare for him. When we went to the
      place a smoke descended from heaven to the place where he was to come. When the smoke disappeared, there was a man
      of about forty, which was the Son of God. The man said:”</p>

    <p>“‘My grandchildren! I am glad you have come far away to see your relatives. This are your people who have come
      back from your country.’ When he said he want us to go with him, we looked and we saw a land created across the
      ocean on which all the nations of Indians were coming home, but, as the messiah looked at the land which was
      created and reached across the ocean, again disappeared, saying that it was not time for that to take place. The
      messiah then gave to Good Thunder some paints—Indian paint and a white paint—a green grass [sagebrush twigs?]; and
      said, ‘My grandchildren, when you get home, go to farming and send all your children to school. And on way home if
      you kill any buffalo cut the head, the tail, and the four feet and leave them, and that buffalo will come to live
      again. When the soldiers of the white people chief want to arrest me, I shall stretch out my arms, which will
      knock them to nothingness, or, if not that, the earth will open and swallow them in. My father commanded me to
      visit the Indians on a purpose. I have came to the white people first, but they not good. They killed me, and you
      can see the marks of my wounds on my feet, my hands, and on my back. My father has given you life—your old
      life—and you have come to see your friends, but you will not take me home with you at this time. I want you to
      tell when you get home your people to follow my examples. Any one Indian does not obey me and tries to be on
      white’s side will be covered over by a new land that is to come over this old one. You will, all the people, use
      the paints and grass I give you. In the spring when the green grass comes, your people who have gone before you
      will come back, and you shall see your friends then, for you have come to my call.’”</p>

    <p>The people from every tipi send for us to visit them. They are people who died many years ago. Chasing Hawk, who
      died not long ago, was there, and we went to his tipi. He was living with his wife, who was killed in war long
      ago. They live in a buffalo skin tipi—a very large one—and he wanted all his friends to go there to live. A son of
      Good Thunder who died in war long ago was one who also took us to his tipi so his father saw him. When coming we
      come to a herd of buffaloes. We killed one and took everything except the four feet, head, and tail, and when we
      came a little ways from it there was the buffaloes come to life again and went off. This was one of the messiah’s
      word came to truth. The messiah said, “I will short your journey when you feel tired of the long ways, if you call
      upon me.” This we did when we were tired. The night came upon us, we stopped at a place, and we called upon the
      messiah to help us, because we were tired of long journey. We went to sleep and in the morning we found ourselves
      at a great distance from where we stopped.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_798">798</span></p>

    <p>The people came back here and they got the people loyal to the government, and those not favor of the whites held
      a council. The agent’s soldiers were sent after them and brought Good Thunder and two others to the agency and
      they were confined to the prison. They were asked by the agent and Captain Sword whether they saw the Son of God
      and whether they hold councils over their return from visit, but Good Thunder refused to say “yes.” They were
      confined in the prison for two days, and upon their promising not to hold councils about their visit they were
      released. They went back to the people and told them about their trouble with the agent. Then they disperse
      without a council.</p>

    <p>In the following spring the people at Pine Ridge agency began to gather at the White Clay creek for councils.
      Just at this time Kicking Bear, from Cheyenne River agency, went on a visit to the Arapaho and said that the
      Arapaho there have ghost dancing. He said that people partaking in dance would get crazy and die, then the messiah
      is seen and all the ghosts. When they die they see strange things, they see their relatives who died long before.
      They saw these things when they died in ghost dance and came to life again. The person dancing becomes dizzy and
      finally drop dead, and the first thing they saw is an eagle comes to them and carried them to where the messiah is
      with his ghosts. The man said this:</p>

    <p>The persons in the ghost dancing are all joined hands. A man stands and then a woman, so in that way forming a
      very large circle. They dance around in the circle in a continuous time until some of them become so tired and
      overtired that they became crazy and finally drop as though dead, with foams in mouth all wet by perspiration. All
      the men and women made holy shirts and dresses they wear in dance. The persons dropped in dance would all lie in
      great dust the dancing make. They paint the white muslins they made holy shirts and dresses out of with blue
      across the back, and alongside of this is a line of yellow paint. They also paint in the front part of the shirts
      and dresses. A picture of an eagle is made on the back of all the shirts and dresses. On the shoulders and on the
      sleeves they tied eagle feathers. They said that the bullets will not go through these shirts and dresses, so they
      all have these dresses for war. Their enemies weapon will not go through these dresses. The ghost dancers all have
      to wear eagle feather on head. With this feather any man would be made crazy if fan with this feather. In the
      ghost dance no person is allow to wear anything made of any metal, except the guns made of metal is carry by some
      of the dancers. When they come from ghosts or after recovery from craziness, they brought meat from the ghosts or
      from the supposed messiah. They also brought water, fire, and wind with which to kill all the whites or Indians
      who will help the chief of the whites. They made sweat house and made holes in the middle of the sweat house where
      they say the water will come out of these holes. Before they begin to dance they all raise their hands toward the
      northwest and cry in supplication to the messiah and then begin the dance with the song, “<i>Ate misunkala ceya
      omani-ye</i>,” etc.</p>

  <h4 id="Selwyns_interview">SELWYN’S INTERVIEW WITH KUWAPI</h4>

  <p>On November 21, 1890, it was reported to Agent E. W. Foster, in charge of Yankton agency, South Dakota, that an
    Indian named Kuwapi, from Rosebud agency, was on the reservation teaching the doctrine and ceremony of the Ghost
    dance. He at once had the man arrested by a force in charge of William T. Selwyn, a full-blood Yankton Sioux, who
    had received a fair education under the patronage of a gentleman in Philadelphia, and who had for several years been
    employed in various capacities at different Sioux agencies. Selwyn had recently come from Pine Ridge, where he had
    learned and reported to Agent Gallagher something of the religious excitement among the<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_799">799</span> western Sioux, and had afterward repeated this information to the agent at Yankton.
    While Kuwapi was in his custody Selwyn questioned him at length concerning the new doctrine, and forwarded the
    following report (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, Document 36861—1890</i>) of the interview to Agent Foster:</p>

  <blockquote>

    <div>Colonel <span class="smcap">E. W. Foster</span>,<br>
      <span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>United States Indian Agent, Yankton Agency, South Dakota</i>.</span></div>

    <p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: It has been reported here a few days ago that there was an Indian visitor up
      at White Swan from Rosebud agency who has been telling or teaching the doctrines of the new messiah, and has made
      some agitation among the people up there. According to the request of Captain Conrad, United States Army, of Fort
      Randall, South Dakota, and by your order of the 21st instant, I went up to White Swan and have arrested the wanted
      man (Kuwapi, or One they chased after). On my way to the agency with the prisoner I have made little interview
      with him on the subject of the new messiah. The following are the facts which he corroborated concerning the new
      messiah, his laws and doctrines to the Indians of this continent:</p>

    <p>Q. Do you believe in the new messiah?—A. I somewhat believe it.</p>

    <p>Q. What made you believe it?—A. Because I ate some of the buffalo meat that he (the new messiah) sent to the
      Rosebud Indians through Short Bull.</p>

    <p>Q. Did Short Bull say that he saw the living herd of roaming buffaloes while he was with the son of the Great
      Spirit?—A. Short Bull told the Indians at Rosebud that the buffalo and other wild game will be restored to the
      Indians at the same time when the general resurrection in favor of the Indians takes place.</p>

    <p>Q. You said a “general resurrection in favor of the Indians takes place;” when or how soon will this be?—A. The
      father sends word to us that he will have all these caused to be so in the spring, when the grass is knee high.<p>

    <p>Q. You said “father;” who is this father?—A. It is the new messiah. He has ordered his children (Indians) to call
      him “father.”</p>

    <p>Q. You said the father is not going to send the buffalo until the resurrection takes place. Would he be able to
      send a few buffaloes over this way for a sort of a sample, so as to have his children (Indians) to have a taste of
      the meat?—A. The father wishes to do things all at once, even in destroying the white race.</p>

    <p>Q. You said something about the destroying of the white race. Do you mean to say that all mankind except the
      Indians will be killed?—A. Yes.</p>

    <p>Q. How, and who is going to kill the white people?—A. The father is going to cause a big cyclone or whirlwind, by
      which he will have all the white people to perish.</p>

    <p>Q. If it should be a cyclone or whirlwind, what are we going to do to protect ourselves?—A. The father will make
      some kind of provisions by which we will be saved.</p>

    <p>Q. You said something about the coming destruction on the white people by your father. Supposing your father is
      sick, tired out, forget, or some other accidental cause by which he should not be able to accomplish his purpose,
      what would be the case about the destroying of the white people?—A. There is no doubt about these things, as the
      miracle performer or the father is going to do just as what he said he would do.</p>

    <p>Q. What other object could you come to by which you are led to believe that there is such a new messiah on earth
      at present?—A. The ghost dancers are fainted whenever the dance goes on.</p>

    <p>Q. Do you believe that they are really fainted?—A. Yes.</p>

    <p>Q. What makes you believe that the dancers have really fainted?—A. Because when they wake or come back to their
      senses they sometimes bring back some news from the unknown world, and some little trinkets, such as buffalo tail,
      buffalo meat, etc.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_800">800</span></p>

    <p>Q. What did the fainted ones see when they get fainted?—A. They visited the happy hunting ground, the camps,
      multitudes of people, and a great many strange people.</p>

    <p>Q. What did the ghost or the strange people tell the fainted one or ones?—A. When the fainted one goes to the
      camp, he is welcomed by the relatives of the visitor (the fainted one), and he is also invited to several feasts.<p>

    <p>Q. Were the people at Rosebud agency anxiously waiting or expecting to see all of their dead relatives who have
      died several years ago?—A. Yes.</p>

    <p>Q. We will have a great many older folks when all the dead people come back, would we not?—A. The visitors all
      say that there is not a single old man nor woman in the other world—all changed to young.</p>

    <p>Q. Are we going to die when the dead ones come back?—A. No; we will be just the same as we are today.</p>

    <p>Q. Did the visitor say that there is any white men in the other world?—A. No; no white people.</p>

    <p>Q. If there is no white people in the other world, where did they get their provisions and clothing?—A. In the
      other world, the messenger tells us that they have depended altogether for their food on the flesh of buffalo and
      other wild game; also, they were all clad in skins of wild animals.</p>

    <p>Q. Did the Rosebud agency Indians believe the new messiah, or the son of the Great Spirit?—A. Yes.</p>

    <p>Q. How do they show that they have a belief in the new messiah?—A. They show themselves by praying to the father
      by looking up to heaven, and call him “father,” just the same as you would in a church.</p>

    <p>Q. Have you ever been in a church?—A. No.</p>

    <p>Q. Do you faithfully believe in the new messiah?—A. I did not in the first place, but as I became more acquainted
      with the doctrines of the new messiah that I really believe in him.</p>

    <p>Q. How many people at Rosebud, in your opinion, believe this new messiah?—A. Nearly every one.</p>

    <p>Q. Did you not the Rosebud people prepare to attack the white people this summer? While I was at Pine Ridge
      agency this summer the Oglalla Sioux Indians say they will resist against the government if the latter should try
      to put a stop to the messiah question. Did your folks at Rosebud say the same thing?—A. Yes.</p>

    <p>Q. Are they still preparing and thinking to attack the white people should the government send our soldiers with
      orders to put a stop to your new business of the messiah?—A. I do not know, but I think that the Wojaji band at
      Rosebud agency will do some harm at any time.</p>

    <p>Q. You do not mean to say that the Rosebud Indians will try and cause an outbreak?—A. That seems to be the case.<p>

    <p>Q. You said something about the “son of the Great Spirit,” or “the father.” What do you mean by the son of the
      Great Spirit?—A. This father, as he is called, said himself that he is the son of the Great Spirit.</p>

    <p>Q. Have you talked to or with any Indian at White Swan about the new messiah, his laws and doctrines, or have you
      referred this to anyone while there?—A. I have told a few of them. I did not voluntarily express my wish for them
      to know and follow the doctrines of the new messiah.</p>

    <p>Q. Yes, but you have explained the matter to the Indians, did you not?—A. Yes, I have.</p>

    <p>Q. Do the Yankton Indians at White Swan believe in your teaching of the new messiah?—A. I did not intend to teach
      them, but as I have been questioned on the subject, that I have said something about it.</p>

    <p>Q. Did any of them believe in you?—A. Some have already believed it, and some of them did not believe it.</p>

    <p>Q. Those that have believed in you must be better men than the others, are they not?—A. I do not know.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_801">801</span></p>

    <p>Q. Do you intend to introduce the doctrines of the new messiah from Rosebud to this agency as a missionary of the
      gospel?—A. No, I did not.</p>

    <p>Q. What brings you here, then?—A. I have some relatives here that I wanted to see, and this was the reason why I
      came here.</p>

    <p>Q. Where does this new messiah question originate? I mean from the first start of it.—A. This has originated in
      White mountains.</p>

    <p>Q. Where is this White mountain?—A. Close to the big Rocky mountains, near the country that belong to the
      Mexicans.</p>

    <p>Q. Do you think that there will be a trouble in the west by next spring?—A. Yes.</p>

    <p>Q. What makes you think so?—A. Because that is what I have heard people talk of.</p>

    <p>This is all that I have questioned Kuwapi on the subject of the new messiah.</p>

      THE GHOST DANCE WEST OF THE ROCKIES</h2>
  </div>

  <p>The first Ghost dance on Walker Lake reservation took place in January, 1889, about a mile above the railroad
    bridge near the agency. Wovoka’s preaching had already been attracting general attention among his own people for
    some months. It is said that six Apache attended this first dance, but the statement is improbable, as this would
    imply that they had made a journey of 600 miles through a desert country to see a man as yet unknown outside of his
    own tribe. From this time, however, his fame went abroad, and another large dance in the same vicinity soon after
    was attended by a number of Ute from Utah. The Ute are neighbors of the Paiute on the east, as the Bannock are on
    the north, and these tribes were naturally the first to hear of the new prophet and to send delegates to attend the
    dance. The doctrine spread almost simultaneously to all the scattered bands of Paiute in Nevada, Oregon, and
    adjacent sections.</p>

  <p>In its essential features the Ghost dance among the Paiute as conducted by the messiah himself was practically the
    same as among the majority of the prairie tribes, as will later be described. The Sioux, Kiowa, and perhaps some
    other tribes, however, danced around a tree or pole set up in the center of the ring, differing in this respect from
    the Paiute, as well as from the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Caddo, and others. No fire was allowed within the ring by any of
    the prairie tribes among whom the subject was investigated, but among the Paiute it seems that fires were built
    either within the circle or close to it. When I visited the messiah in January, 1892, deep snow was on the ground,
    which had caused the temporary suspension of dancing, so that I had no opportunity of seeing the performance there
    for myself. I saw, however, the place cleared for the dance ground—the same spot where the large delegation from
    Oklahoma had attended the dance the preceding summer—at the upper end of Mason valley. A large circular space had
    been cleared of sagebrush and leveled over, and around the circumference were the remains of the low round
    structures of willow branches which had sheltered those in attendance. At one side, within the circle, was a larger
    structure of branches, where the messiah gave audience to the delegates from distant tribes, and, according to their
    statements, showed them the glories of the spirit world through the medium of hypnotic trances. The Paiute always
    dance five nights, or perhaps more properly four nights and the morning of the fifth day,<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_803">803</span> as enjoined, by the messiah on the visiting delegates, ending the performance with a
    general shaking and waving of blankets, as among the prairie tribes, after which all go down and bathe in the
    nearest stream. The shaking of the blankets dispels all evil influences and drives sickness and disease away from
    the dancers. There is no previous consecration of the ground, as among the Arapaho, and no preliminary sweat bath,
    as among the Sioux. The sweat bath seems to be unknown to the Paiute, who are preeminently a dirty people, and I saw
    no trace of sweat-house frames at any of their camps. Nakash, the Arapaho who visited the messiah in 1889 and first
    brought the dance to the eastern tribes, confirmed the statements of the Paiute and ranchmen that there were no
    trances in the Paiute Ghost dance.</p>

  <p>Besides the dance ground in Mason valley, where the messiah himself generally presided, there were several others
    on Walker River reservation, although, if we are to believe the agent, no Ghost dances were ever held on either
    reservation.</p>

  <p>The following extract from Porcupine’s account of his visit to the messiah in the fall of 1889 (see <a href="#Page_793">page 793</a>) gives
    some idea of the Paiute Ghost dance and throws light on the cataleptic peculiarities of the messiah:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I went to the agency at Walker lake, and they told us Christ would be there in two days. At the end of two days,
      on the third morning, hundreds of people gathered at this place. They cleared off a place near the agency in the
      form of a circus ring and we all gathered there. This space was perfectly cleared of grass, etc. We waited there
      till late in the evening, anxious to see Christ. Just before sundown I saw a great many people, mostly Indians,
      coming dressed in white men’s clothes. The Christ was with them. They all formed in this ring in a circle around
      him. They put up sheets all around the circle, as they had no tents. Just after dark some of the Indians told me
      that the Christ (father) was arrived. I looked around to find him, and finally saw him sitting on one side of the
      ring. They all started toward him to see him. They made a big fire to throw light on him. I never looked around,
      but went forward, and when I saw him I bent my head.... He sat there a long time and nobody went up to speak to
      him. He sat with his head bowed all the time. After awhile he rose and said he was very glad to see his children.
      “I have sent for you and am glad to see you. I am going to talk to you after awhile about your relatives who are
      dead and gone. My children, I want you to listen to all I have to say to you. I will teach you, too, how to dance
      a dance, and I want you to dance it. Get ready for your dance, and then when the dance is over I will talk to
      you.” He was dressed in a white coat with stripes. The rest of his dress was a white man’s, except that he had on
      a pair of moccasins. Then he commenced our dance, everybody joining in, the Christ singing while we danced. We
      danced till late in the night; then he told us we had danced enough.</p>

    <p>The next morning after breakfast was over, we went into the circle and spread canvas over it on the ground, the
      Christ standing in the midst of us. He told us he was going away that day, but would be back the next morning and
      talk to us.... He had no beard or whiskers, but very heavy eyebrows. He was a good-looking man. We were crowded up
      very close. We had been told that nobody was to talk, and that even if we whispered the Christ would know it....
      He would talk to us all day.</p>

    <p>That evening we all assembled again to see him depart. When we were assembled he began to sing, and he commenced
      to tremble all over violently for a while <span class="pagenum" id="Page_804">804</span>and then sat down. We
      danced all that night, the Christ lying down beside us apparently dead.</p>

    <p>The next morning when we went to eat breakfast, the Christ was with us. After breakfast four heralds went around
      and called out that the Christ was back with us and wanted to talk with us. The circle was prepared again. The
      people assembled, and Christ came among us and sat down. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 9.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We come now to the other tribes bordering on the Paiute. First in order are the Washo, a small band dwelling on the
    slopes of the sierras in the neighborhood of Carson, Nevada, and speaking a peculiar language of unknown affinity.
    They are completely under the domination of the Paiute. They had no separate dance, but joined in with the nearest
    camps of Paiute and sang the same songs. Occupying practically the same territory as the Paiute, they were among the
    first to receive the new doctrine.</p>

  <p>Farther to the south, in California, about Bridgeport and Mono lake and extending across to the westward slope of
    the sierras, are several small Shoshonean bands closely akin to the Paiute and known locally as the “Diggers.” The
    Paiute state that bands of these Indians frequently came up and participated in the dance on the reservation. They
    undoubtedly had their own dances at home also.</p>

  <p>According to the statement of the agent in charge of the Mission Indians in southern California in 1891, the
    doctrine reached them also, and the medicine-men of Potrero began to prophesy the destruction of the whites and the
    return of Indian supremacy. Few believed their predictions, however, until rumors brought the news of the overflow
    of Colorado river and the birth of “Salton sea” in the summer of 1891. Never doubting that the great change was near
    at hand, the frightened Indians fled to the mountains to await developments, but after having gone hungry for
    several days the millennial dawn seemed still as far away as ever, and they returned to their homes with
    disappointment in their hearts. Although the agent mentions specifically only the Indians of Potrero, there can be
    no doubt that the inhabitants of the other Mission rancherias in the vicinity were also affected, and we are thus
    enabled to fix the boundary of the messiah excitement in this direction at the Pacific ocean. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 27.</i>)</p>

  <p>In northern California the new doctrine was taken up late in 1890 by the Pit River Indians, a group of tribes
    constituting a distinct linguistic stock and scattered throughout the whole basin of Pit river, from Goose lake to
    the Sacramento, which may have formed the boundary of the Ghost-dance movement in this direction. (<i><a href="#AGO">A. G. O.</a>,
    7.</i>) As a number of these Indians are living also on Round Valley reservation in California, it is possible
    that the doctrine may have reached there also. Having obtained the dance ritual directly from the Paiute, their
    neighbors on the east, the ceremony and belief were probably the same with both tribes.</p>

  <p>So far as can be learned from the reports of agents, and from the statement of Wovoka himself, the dance was never
    taken up by the Indians of Hoopa Valley reservation in California; of Klamath, Siletz,<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_805">805</span> Grande Ronde, or Umatilla reservations in Oregon; by any of the tribes in
    Washington; by those of Lapwai or Cœur d’Alêne reservations in Idaho; or on Jocko reservation in Montana. Wovoka
    stated that he had been visited by delegates from Warmspring agency, in Oregon, who also had taken part in the
    dance, but these may have been some of the Paiute living on that reservation. The small band of Paiute living with
    the Klamath probably also attended the dance at some time.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10"
    class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <p>A single Nez Percé visited the messiah, but the visit had no effect on his tribe at home. In a general way it may
    be stated that the doctrine of the Ghost dance was never taken up by any tribes of the Salishan or Shahaptian
    stocks, occupying practically the whole of the great Columbia basin. This is probably due to the fact that the more
    important of these tribes have been for a long time under the influence of Catholic or other Christian missionaries,
    while most of the others are adherents of the Smohalla or the Shaker doctrine.</p>

  <p>Of the tribes southward from the Paiute, according to the best information obtainable, the Ghost dance never
    reached the Yuma, Pima, Papago, Maricopa, or any of the Apache bands in Arizona or New Mexico, neither did it affect
    any of the Pueblo tribes except the Taos, who performed the dance merely as a pastime. As before stated, it is said
    that six Apache attended the first large dance at Walker lake in 1889. This seems improbable, but if true it
    produced no effect on any part of the tribe at large. Later on the Jicarilla Apache, in northern New Mexico, may
    have heard of it through the southern Ute, but, so far as is known officially, neither of these tribes ever engaged
    in the dance. The agent of the Jicarilla states that the tribe knew nothing of the doctrine until informed of it by
    himself. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 10.</i>) It seems never to have been taken up by the Mescalero Apache in southern New Mexico,
    although they are in the habit of making frequent visits to the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, and other Ghost-dancing
    tribes of Oklahoma. The agent of the Mohave states officially that these Indians knew nothing about it, but this
    must be a mistake, as there is constant communication between the Mohave and the southern Paiute, and, according to
    Wovoka’s statement, Mohave delegates attended the dance in 1890, while the 700 Walapai and Chemehuevi associated
    with the Mohave are known to have been devoted adherents of the doctrine.</p>

  <p>The dance was taken up nearly simultaneously by the Bannock, Shoshoni, Gosiute, and Ute in the early part of 1889.
    All these tribes are neighbors (on the east) of the Paiute and closely cognate to them, the Bannock particularly
    having only a slight dialectal difference of language, so that communication between them is an easy matter. The</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_806">806</span></p>

  <p>Bannock are chiefly on Fort Hall and Lemhi reservations in Idaho. The Shoshoni are on the Western Shoshone (Duck
    Valley) reservation in Nevada, on Fort Hall and Lemhi reservations in Idaho, and on Wind River reservation in
    Wyoming. The Ute are on Uintah and Uncompahgre reservations in Utah, and on the Southern Ute reservation in
    Colorado. There are also a considerable number of Bannock and Shoshoni not on reservations. The Ute of Utah sent
    delegates to the messiah soon after the first Ghost dance in January, 1889, but it is doubtful if the southern Ute
    in Colorado were engaged in the dance. Although aware of the doctrine, they ridiculed the idea of the dead returning
    to earth. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 11.</i>)</p>

  <p>In regard to the dance among the Shoshoni and Paiute on the Western Shoshoni reservation, in Nevada and Idaho,
    their agent writes, under date of November 8, 1890:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Indians of this reservation and vicinity have just concluded their second medicine dance, the previous one
      having taken place in August last. They are looking for the coming of the Indian Christ, the resurrection of the
      dead Indians, and the consequent supremacy of the Indian race. Fully one thousand people took part in the dance.
      While the best of order prevailed, the excitement was very great as morning approached. When the dancers were worn
      out mentally and physically, the medicine-men would shout that they could see the faces of departed friends and
      relatives moving about the circle. No pen can paint the picture of wild excitement that ensued. All shouted in a
      chorus, Christ has come, and then danced and sung until they fell in a confused and exhausted mass on the
      ground.... I apprehend no trouble beyond the loss of time and the general demoralizing effect of these large
      gatherings of people. Several of the leading men have gone to Walker lake to confer with a man who calls himself
      Christ. Others have gone to Fort Hall to meet Indians from Montana and Dakota, to get the news from that section.
      In fact, the astonishing part of the business is the fact that all the Indians in the country seem to possess
      practically the same ideas and expect about the same result. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 12.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On December 6 he writes that another Ghost dance had then been in progress for six days, and that the Indians had
    announced their intention to dance one week in each month until the grass grew, at which time the medicine-men had
    told them the messiah would come, bringing with him all their dead friends. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 13.</i>) This dance, however,
    was attended by a much smaller number of Indians, and skeptics had already arisen among them to scoff at the new
    believers. The leaven was working, and only a little shrewd diplomacy was needed to turn the religious scale, as is
    shown by an extract from a third letter, dated January 10, 1891, from which it would seem that Agent Plumb is a man
    of practical common sense, as likewise that Esau was not the only one who would sell his birthright for a mess of
    pottage:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Christmas day was the day set for commencing another dance. On learning this, I told the Indians that it was my
      intention to give them all a big feast and have a general holiday on Christmas, but that I would not give them
      anything if they intended to dance. I told them they could play all of their usual games, in fact, have a good
      time, but that dancing was forbidden. I showed them how continued dancing at various Sioux agencies had ended in
      soldiers being sent to stop them. I stated the case as clearly as I could; the Indians debated it two days, and
      then <span class="pagenum" id="Page_807">807</span>reported that while they hoped their dead friends would
      come back, and believed that dancing would help to bring them, yet they were friends of the government, and
      friends of the whites, and my friends, and would not hold any more resurrection dances without my consent. Up to
      this date they have kept their word. I have no hope of breaking up their dances altogether, but I have strong
      hopes of controlling them. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 14.</i>)</p>

  <p>The Bannock and Shoshoni of Fort Hall reservation in Idaho have served as the chief medium of the doctrine between
    the tribes west of the mountains and those of the plains. Situated almost on the summit of the great divide, they
    are within easy reach of the Paiute to the west, among whom the dance originated, and whose language the Bannock
    speak, while at no great distance to the east, on Wind River reservation in Wyoming, the remaining Shoshoni are
    confederated with the Arapaho, who have been from the first the great apostles of the doctrine among the prairie
    tribes. There is constant visiting back and forth between the tribes of these two reservations, while the four
    railroads coming in at Fort Hall, together with the fact of its close proximity to the main line of the Union
    Pacific, tend still more to make it a focus and halting point for Indian travel. Almost every delegation from the
    tribes east of the mountains stopped at this agency to obtain the latest news from the messiah and to procure
    interpreters from among the Bannock to accompany them to Nevada. In a letter of November 26, 1890, to the Indian
    Commissioner, the agent in charge states that during the preceding spring and summer his Indians had been visited by
    representatives from about a dozen different reservations. In regard to the dance and the doctrine at Fort Hall, he
    also says that the extermination and resurrection business was not a new thing with his tribes by any means, but had
    been quite a craze with them every few years for the last twenty years or more, only varying a little according to
    the whim of particular medicine-men. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 15.</i>) This may have referred to the doctrine already mentioned as
    having been taught by Tävibo.</p>

  <p>Early in 1889 a Bannock from Fort Hall visited the Shoshoni and Arapaho of Wind River reservation in Wyoming and
    brought them the first knowledge of the new religion. He had just returned from a visit to the Paiute country, where
    he said he had met messengers who had told him that the dead people were coming back, and who had commanded him to
    go and tell all the tribes. “And so,” said the Shoshoni, “he came here and told us all about it.” Accordingly, in
    the summer of that year a delegation of five Shoshoni, headed by Täbinshi, with Nakash (“Sage”), an Arapaho, visited
    the messiah of Mason valley, traveling most of the way by railroad and occupying several days in the journey. They
    attended a Ghost dance, which, according to their accounts, was a very large one, and after dancing all night were
    told by the messiah that they would meet all their dead in two years from that time at the turning of the leaves, i.&nbsp;e.,
    in the autumn of 1891. They were urged to dance frequently, “because the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_808">
    808</span> dance moves the dead.” One of the Shoshoni delegates understood the Bannock and Paiute language and
    interpreted for the rest. The information was probably conveyed by the Shoshoni to the Arapaho through the medium of
    the sign language.</p>

  <p>In accord with the report of the delegates, on their return home the Shoshoni and Arapaho at once began to dance. A
    year later, in the fall of 1890, a dense smoke from forest fires in the mountains drifted down and obscured the air
    in the lower country to such an extent that horses were lost in the haze. This was regarded by the Indians as an
    indication of the approach of the great change, and the dance was continued with increased fervor, but at last the
    atmosphere began to clear and the phenomenon ended as it had begun—in smoke. The dance was kept up, however, without
    abatement for another year, until the predicted time had come and gone, when the Shoshoni—who seem to share the
    skeptical nature of their southern kinsmen, the Comanche—concluded that they had been deceived, and abandoned the
    dance. The Arapaho, who have greater faith in the unseen things of the spirit world, kept it up, and were still
    dancing when I visited them in the summer of 1892. A part of the Arapaho, headed by their chief, Black Coal, and
    encouraged by the Catholic missionaries, had steadily opposed the dance from the first. After considerable
    discussion of the matter it was decided, on Black Coal’s proposition, to send another delegation to the messiah,
    under the guidance of Yellow Eagle, a graduate of a government Indian school, to learn as to the truth or falsity of
    the new doctrine. They returned early in 1891 and reported against the movement. Their report confirmed the doubters
    in their skepticism, but produced little effect on the rest of the tribe.</p>

  <p>When I visited Wind River reservation in Wyoming in June, 1892, the agent in charge informed me that there was no
    Ghost dancing on his reservation; that he had explained how foolish it was and had strictly forbidden it, and that
    in consequence the Indians had abandoned it. However, he expressed interest in my investigation, and as the Arapaho,
    with whom I had most to do, were then camped in a body a few miles up in the mountains cutting wood, he very kindly
    furnished a conveyance and camping outfit, with two of the agency employees—a clerk and an interpreter—to take me
    out. It appeared afterward that the escort had received instructions of their own before starting. Having reached
    the camp and set up our tent, the Arapaho soon came around to get acquainted, over a pipe and a cup of coffee; but,
    in answer to questions put by one of my companions, a white man, who assumed the burden of the conversation, it
    seemed that the Indians had lost all interest in the dance. In fact, some of them were so ignorant on the subject
    that they wanted to know what it meant.</p>

  <p>After trying in vain to convince me that it was useless to waste time further with the Indians, the clerk started
    back again after supper, satisfied that that part of the country was safe so far as the Ghost<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_809">809</span> dance was concerned. By this time it was dark, and the Indians invited the
    interpreter and myself to come over to a tipi about half a mile away, where we could meet all the old men. We
    started, and had gone but a short distance when we heard from a neighboring hill the familiar measured cadence of
    the ghost songs. On turning with a questioning look to my interpreter—who was himself a half-blood—he quietly said:
    “Yes; they are dancing the Ghost dance. That’s something I have never reported, and I never will. It is their
    religion and they have a right to it.” Not wishing to be an accomplice in crime, I did not go over to the dance; but
    it is needless to state that the old men in the tipi that night, and for several successive nights thereafter, knew
    all about the songs and ceremonies of the new religion. As already stated, the Shoshoni had really lost faith and
    abandoned the dance.</p>

  <p>Among the Shoshoni the dance was performed around a small cedar tree, planted in the ground for that purpose.
    Unlike the Sioux, they hung nothing on this tree. The men did not clasp each other’s hands, but held on to their
    blankets instead; but a woman standing between two men took hold of their hands. There was no preliminary medicine
    ceremony. The dance took place usually in the morning, and at its close the performers shook their blankets in the
    air, as among the Paiute and other tribes, before dispersing. However novel may have been the doctrine, the Shoshoni
    claim that the Ghost dance itself as performed by them was a revival of an old dance which they had had fully fifty
    years before.</p>

  <p>The selection of the cedar in this connection is in agreement with the general Indian idea, which has always
    ascribed a mystic sacredness to that tree, from its never-dying green, which renders it so conspicuous a feature of
    the desert landscape; from the aromatic fragrance of its twigs, which are burned as incense in sacred ceremonies;
    from the durability and fine texture of its wood, which makes it peculiarly appropriate for tipi poles and lance
    shafts; and from the dark-red color of its heart, which seems as though dyed in blood. In Cherokee myth the cedar
    was originally a pole, to the top of which they fastened the fresh scalps of their enemies, and the wood was thus
    stained by the blood that trickled slowly down along it to the ground. The Kiowa also selected a cedar for the
    center of their Ghost-dance circle.</p>

  <p>We go back now to the southern tribes west of the mountains. Some time in the winter of 1889–90 Paiute runners
    brought to the powerful tribe of the Navaho, living in northern New Mexico and Arizona, the news of the near advent
    of the messiah and the resurrection of the dead. They preached and prophesied for a considerable time, but the
    Navaho were skeptical, laughed at the prophets, and paid but little attention to the prophesies. (<i><a href="#Matthews">Matthews</a>,
    1.</i>) According to the official report for 1892, these Indians, numbering somewhat over 16,000 souls, have, in
    round numbers, 9,000 cattle, 119,000 horses, and 1,600,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_810">810</span> sheep
    and goats; and, as suggested by Dr Matthews, the authority on that tribe, it may be that, being rich in herds and
    wealth of silver, they felt no special need of a redeemer. While with the Navaho in the winter of 1892–93 I made
    inquiry in various parts of their wide-extended territory, but could not learn that the Ghost dance had ever been
    performed among them, and it evident that in their case the doctrinal seed had fallen on barren ground.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 70</span>—Navaho Indians.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Before visiting the tribe, I had written for information to Mr A. M. Stephen, of Keams Cañon, Arizona, since
    deceased, who had studied the Navaho and Hopi for years and spoke the Navaho language fluently. I quote from him on
    the subject. It may be noted that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_811">811</span> Keams Cañon is about 125 miles
    northwest of Fort Wingate, the point from which Dr Matthews writes, and nearer by that much to the Paiute, Cohonino,
    and Walapai, all of whom have accepted the new religion. Mr Stephen states that some time in February or March,
    1890, he first heard rumors among the Navaho that “the old men long dead” had returned to some foreign tribes in the
    north or east, the vague far away. The intelligence was brought to the Navaho either by the Ute or Paiute, or both.
    The rumor grew and the idea became commonly current among the Navaho that the mythic heroes were to return and that
    under their direction they were to expel American and Mexican and restrict the Zuñi and Hopi close to their
    villages, and, in fact, to reestablish their old domain from San Francisco mountains to Santa Fé. (<i><a href="#Stephen">Stephen</a>,
    1.</i>) On November 22, 1891, he further writes:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>While out this last time I camped over night with some Navajo friends, and over a pipe brought up the messiah
      topic. This family belongs to the Bitter-Water gens, and this is the gist of what I got from them: A Pah-ute came
      to a family of their gens living near Navajo mountain and told them that <i>Na′-Keh-tkla-ĭ</i> was to return from
      the under world and bring back all the Tinneh (Navajo) he had killed. <i>Na′-keh-tkla-ĭ</i> (i.&nbsp;e., “foreigner
      with white foot sole”) in the long ago had a puma and a bear. These were his pets. He would call puma from the
      east and bear from the west, and just before dawn they met in the center. Thus they met four times. On the fourth
      meeting puma reached back with his forepaw and plucked his mane, tossing the hair aloft, and for every hair a
      Tinneh died. This fatal sorcery continued for a long time, and great numbers were killed. Now, the Pah-ute said,
      this sorcerer was to return, and would call his pets, and they would come east and west, and following their trail
      would be all the people whose death they had caused. These Navajo said they had heard of other Pah-ute prophecies
      a year or more ago, all to the effect that long dead people were to return alive from the under world. These
      resurrected ones were also to bring back the departed game, and the Tinneh would again dominate the region. But,
      said my informant, <i>datsaigi yelti</i>, “it is worthless talk.” (<i><a href="#Stephen">Stephen</a>, 2.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In connection with hypnotism as seen in the Ghost dance, Dr Matthews states that in one curious Navaho ceremony he
    has several times seen the patient hypnotized or pretend to be hypnotized by a character dressed in evergreens. The
    occurrence of the hypnotic trance is regarded as a sign that the ceremony has been effective. If the trance does not
    occur, some other ceremony must be tried. (<i><a href="#Matthews">Matthews</a>, 2.</i>)</p>

  <p>West of the Navaho in northeastern Arizona live the Hopi, or Moki, a Pueblo tribe occupying several villages on the
    tops of nearly inaccessible mesas. In July, 1891, four of these Indians, while on a visit to the Cohonino, living
    farther to the west, first heard of the new doctrine and witnessed a Ghost dance, as will be described hereafter.
    They brought back the news to their people, but it made no impression on them and the matter was soon forgotten.
    (<i><a href="#Stephen">Stephen</a>, 3.</i>) In this connection Mr Stephen states, in response to a letter of inquiry, that although he does
    not recollect any Hopi myth concerning rejuvenation of the world and reunion with the resurrected dead on this
    earth, yet the doctrine of a reunion with the revivified dead in the under world is a commonly accepted belief of
    the Hopi. They have also a curious myth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_812">812</span> of a fair-hair god and a
    fair-skin people who came up from the under world with the Hopi, and who then left them with a promise to return.
    This suggests the idea of a messiah, but Mr Stephen has not yet been able to get the myth in its entirety. He does
    not think it derived from any corrupt source, however, through Spanish or other missionaries, as the allusions are
    all of archaic tendency. (<i><a href="#Stephen">Stephen</a>, 4.</i>)</p>

  <p>The Cohonino or Havasupai are a small tribe occupying the canyon of Cataract creek, an affluent of the Colorado, in
    northern Arizona,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_813">813</span> about 120 miles west of the Hopi, with whom
    they have a considerable trade in buckskins and mesquite bread. They probably obtained the doctrine and the dance
    directly from the Paiute to the northward. Our only knowledge of the Cohonino dance is derived through Hopi
    informants, and as the two tribes speak languages radically different the ideas conveyed were neither complete nor
    definite, but it is evident that the general doctrine was the same, although the dance differed in some respects
    from that of the other tribes.</p>

  <p>We quote again from Stephen’s letter of November 22, 1891:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>During a quiet interval, in one of the kivas I found the Hopi who brought the tidings of the resurrection to his
      people. His name is Pütci and his story is very meager and confused. He went on a customary trading visit to the
      Cojonino in their home at Cataract creek, and I could not determine just when. The chief of the Cojonino is named
      Navajo, and when Pütci got there, Navajo had but lately returned from a visit to the westward. He had been with
      the Walapai, the Mohave, and perhaps still farther west, and had been gone nearly three months. He told his people
      a vague mystic story that he had heard during his travels, to the effect that the long-time dead people of the
      Antelope, Deer, and Rabbit [Antelope, Deer, etc., are probably Cohonino gentes—J. M.] were to come back and live
      in their former haunts; that they had reached to a place where were the people of the Puma, the Wolf, and the
      Bear; that this meeting delayed the coming, but eventually all these people would appear, and in the sequence here
      related. Pütci was accompanied by three other Hopi, and they said they did not very well understand this strange
      story. While they were stopping in Cataract cañon a one-night dance was held by the Cojonino, at which these Hopi
      were present. During the night a long pole, having the tail of an eagle fastened to the end, was brought out and
      securely planted in the ground, and the dancers were told by their shamans that anyone who could climb this pole
      and put his mouth on the tail would see his dead mother (maternal ancestor). One man succeeded in climbing it and
      laid his mouth on the feathers, and then fell to the bottom in a state of collapse. They deemed him dead, but
      before dawn he recovered and then said that he had seen his dead mother and several other dead ancestors, who told
      him they were all on their way back. The Hopi on their return home related these marvels, but apparently it made
      little impression, and it was only with difficulty I could gather the above meager details.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Through the kindness of Mr Thomas V. Keam, trader for the Hopi and Navaho, we get a revision of Pütci’s story.
    Pütci states that in July, 1891, he with three other Hopi went on a visit to the Cohonino to trade for buckskins.
    When they arrived in the vicinity of the Cohonino camp, they were met by one of the tribe, who informed the visitors
    that all the Indians were engaged in a very important ceremony, and that before they could enter the camp they must
    wash their bodies and paint them with white clay. Accordingly, when this had been done, they were escorted to the
    camp and introduced to the principal chief and headmen, all of whom they found engaged in washing their heads,
    decorating themselves, and preparing for the ceremony, which took place on a clear space near the camp late in the
    afternoon. Here a very tall straight pole had been securely fastened upright in the ground. At the top were tied two
    eagle-tail feathers. A circle was formed around this pole by the Indians, and, after dancing around it until almost
    dark, one of the men climbed the pole to the top, and remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_814">814</span>
    there until exhausted, when he would slide to the ground, clinging insensible to the pole. After remaining in this
    state for some time, the medicine-men resuscitated him. On recovery he stood up and told them he had been into
    another world, where he saw all the old men who had died long ago, and among them his own people. They told him they
    would all come back in time and bring the deer, the antelope, and all other good things they had when they dwelt on
    this earth. This ceremony lasted four days, including the cleansing and decorating of the dancers and the climbing
    of the pole, with an account of what had been seen by the Indian during the time he was in an apparently lifeless
    state. Each day the ceremony was attended by the whole tribe. (<i><a href="#Keam">Keam</a>, 1.</i>) Resuscitation by the medicine-men,
    as here mentioned, is something unknown among the prairie tribes, where the unconscious subject is allowed to lie
    undisturbed on the ground until the senses return in the natural way.</p>

  <p>Beyond the Cohonino, and extending for about 200 miles along Colorado river on the Arizona side, are the associated
    tribes of Mohave, Walapai, and Chemehuevi, numbering in all about 2,800 souls, of whom only about one-third are on a
    reservation. The Chemehuevi, being a branch of the Paiute and in constant communication with them, undoubtedly had
    the dance and the doctrine. The Mohave also have much to do with the Paiute, the two tribes interchanging visits and
    mutually borrowing songs and games. They sent delegates to the messiah and in all probability took up the Ghost
    dance, in spite of the agent’s statement to the contrary. As only 660 of more than 2,000 Mohave are reported as
    being on the reservation, the agent may have a good reason for not keeping fully informed in regard to them.</p>

  <p>Concerning the Walapai we have positive information. In September, 1890, the commanding officer at Fort Whipple was
    informed that a Paiute from southern Utah was among the Walapai, inciting them to dance for the purpose of causing
    hurricanes and storms to destroy the whites and such Indians as would not participate in the dances. It was stated
    also that these dances had then been going on for several months and were participated in by a large portion of the
    tribe, and that each dance lasted four or five nights in succession. On investigation it appeared that this Paiute
    was one of a party who had come down and inaugurated the Ghost dance among the Walapai the preceding year. (<i>G.
      D., 17.</i>)</p>

  <p>We find an account of the Walapai Ghost dance in a local paper a year later. The article states that all the songs
    were in the language of the Paiute, from whom the doctrine had originally come. The Walapai version of the doctrine
    has been already noted. The dance itself, and the step, as here described, are essentially the same as among other
    tribes. Each dance lasted five nights, and on the last night was kept up until daylight. Just before daylight on the
    morning of the last night the medicine men ascended a small butte, where they met and talked<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_815">815</span> with the expected god, and on coming down again delivered his message to the people.
    The dance was held at irregular intervals, according to the instructions received on the butte by the medicine-men.</p>

  <p>The dance place was a circular piece of ground a hundred feet in diameter, inclosed by a fence of poles and bushes,
    and surrounded by high mountain walls of granite, which reflected the light from half a dozen fires blazing within
    the circle. The dancers, to the number of 200, clad in white robes with fancy trimmings, their faces and hair
    painted white in various decorative designs, moved slowly around in a circle, keeping time with a wild chant, while
    200 more stood or crouched around the fires, awaiting their turn to participate. The dancers faced toward the
    center, each holding the hands of the ones next to him and joining in the chant in unison. The dust issued in clouds
    from beneath their feet, and with the dust and exertion together the performers were soon exhausted and dropped out,
    when others took their places. After each circuit they rested a few minutes and then started round again. At each
    circuit a different chant was sung, and thus the dance continued until midnight, when, with a loud clapping of
    hands, it ended, and the people separated and went to their homes. Throughout the performance two or three chiefs or
    medicine-men were constantly going about on the outside of the circle to preserve order and reprimand any merriment,
    one of them explaining to the visitors that, as this was a religious ceremony, due solemnity must be observed.

      THE GHOST DANCE EAST OF THE ROCKIES—AMONG THE SIOUX</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subhead">
    <p>In 1889 the Ogalala heard that the son of God had come upon earth in the west. They said the Messiah was there,
      but he had come to help the Indians and not the whites, and it made the Indians happy to hear this.—<i>George Sword.</i></p>

    <p>They signed away a valuable portion of their reservation, and it is now occupied by white people, for which they
      have received nothing. They understood that ample provision would be made for their support; instead, their
      supplies have been reduced and much of the time they have been living on half and two-thirds rations. Their crops,
      as well as the crops of white people, for two years have been almost a total failure. The disaffection is
      widespread, especially among the Sioux, while the Cheyennes have been on the verge of starvation and were forced
      to commit depredations to sustain life. These facts are beyond question, and the evidence is positive and
      sustained by thousands of witnesses.—<i>General Miles.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>Among the tribes east of the mountains and north of Oklahoma, it appears from official documents in the Indian
    Office and from other obtainable information that the Ghost dance and the doctrine, if known at all, were never
    accepted by the Blackfeet of Montana; the Ojibwa of Turtle mountain and Devils lake in North Dakota, or by the rest
    of the tribe farther to the east in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan; the Omaha, Winnebago, and Ponka in Nebraska;
    the small band of Sauk and Fox in Iowa; the still smaller band of Sauk and Fox, the Potawatomi, Kickapoo, Iowa, and
    Ojibwa in northeastern Kansas; or by the Sioux of Devils lake in North Dakota, Lake Traverse (Sisseton agency) and
    Flandreau in South Dakota, and Santee agency in Nebraska. All or most of these Sioux belong to the Santee or eastern
    division of the tribe, and have long been under civilizing influences. According to official statements the dance
    was not taken up by any of the Sioux of Crow Creek or Yankton agencies in South Dakota, but they were certainly more
    or less affected by it, as they knew all about it and are in constant communication with the wilder bands of Sioux
    which were concerned in the outbreak. I was informed by the Omaha and Winnebago in 1891 that they had been told of
    the new messiah by visiting Sioux from Pine Ridge agency in April, 1890, and later on by other Sioux from Yankton
    agency, but had put no faith in the story, and had never organized a Ghost dance. According to the agent in charge,
    the Crow of Montana were not affected. This, if true, is remarkable, in view of the fact that the Crow are a large
    tribe and comparatively primitive, and have living near them the wildest of the Ghost-dancing tribes, the northern
    Cheyenne especially occupying practically the same reservation. It is possible that their experience in the
    Sword-bearer affair in 1887, already mentioned, had a tendency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_817">817</span> to
    weaken their faith in later prophets. Dr George Bird Grinnell, a competent authority, states, in reply to a personal
    letter, that nothing was known about the dance by the Blackfeet of Montana or by the Blackfeet, Sarsi, or Plains
    Cree on the Canadian side of the boundary line.</p>

  <p>Within the same general region, east of the Rocky mountains and north of Oklahoma, the doctrine and the dance were
    accepted by the Asiniboin (Fort Belknap and Fort Peck agencies), Grosventres (Arapaho subtribe, Fort Belknap
    agency), northern Cheyenne of Montana; the Arikara, Grosventres (Minitari), and Mandan of Fort Berthold agency,
    North Dakota; the Shoshoni and northern Arapaho on Wind River reservation in Wyoming, as already mentioned; and by
    the great body of the Sioux, at Fort Peck agency (Yanktonais), Montana, and at Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, Lower
    Brulé, Pine Ridge, and Rosebud agencies in North Dakota and South Dakota. The whole number of Sioux concerned was
    about 20,000, of whom 16,000 belonged to the Teton division, among the wildest and most warlike of all the western
    tribes. A few Cheyenne are also associated with the Sioux at Pine Ridge.</p>

  <p>The northern Arapaho and the Shoshoni of Wyoming were the medium by which the doctrine of the new messiah was
    originally communicated to all these tribes. In the spring of 1889, Nakash, “Sage,” the Arapaho chief already
    mentioned, crossed the mountains to investigate the reports of the new religion, and brought back a full
    confirmation of all that had been told them from the west. A visiting Grosventre, then among the Arapaho, heard the
    story and brought back the wonderful news to the Grosventres and Asiniboin of Fort Belknap, but although his account
    was received by some with unquestioning faith, the excitement had in it nothing of a dangerous character. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 18.</i>)</p>

  <p>In a short time the news spread to the Cheyenne in Montana and the Sioux of the Dakotas, and in the fall of 1889
    delegates from these two tribes arrived at Fort Washakie to learn more about the messiah in the west. The principal
    Cheyenne delegate was Porcupine, while Short Bull and Kicking Bear were the leaders of the Sioux party. After
    hearing the statements of the Arapaho and Shoshoni, it was decided that some of the Cheyenne should return and
    report to their tribe, while Porcupine and one or two others, with the Sioux delegates, several Shoshoni, and the
    Arapaho, Sitting Bull, and Friday, should go to Nevada, interview the messiah himself, and learn the whole truth of
    the matter. Accordingly, about November, 1889, Porcupine and his companions left Fort Washakie in Wyoming for Fort
    Hall reservation in Idaho, where they met the Shoshoni and Bannock and were well received and entertained by them.
    The tribes at this place were firm believers in the new doctrine, and Porcupine states that from there on to the end
    of the journey all the Indians they met were dancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_818">818</span> the Ghost
    dance. After stopping a few days at Fort Hall, they went on again, accompanied by several Bannock and Shoshoni, and
    going rapidly by railroad soon found themselves in the country of the Paiute, and after stopping at one or two camps
    arrived at the agency at Pyramid lake. Here the Paiute furnished them conveyances and guides to the other agency
    farther south at Walker river. Porcupine is our principal authority for the events of the trip, and although he
    claims that he undertook this journey of a thousand miles without any definite purpose or destination in view, it is
    evident enough from his own narrative that he left Wyoming with the fixed intention of verifying the rumors of a
    messiah. He has much to say of the kindness of the whites they met west of the mountains, who, it will be
    remembered, were largely Mormons, who have always manifested a special interest in the Indians. He also states that
    many of the whites took part with the Indians in the dance.</p>

  <p>They were now in the messiah’s country. “The Fisheaters, near Pyramid lake, told me that Christ had appeared on
    earth again. They said Christ knew he was coming; that eleven of his children were also coming from a far land. It
    appeared that Christ had sent for me to go there, and that was why, unconsciously, I took my journey. It had been
    foreordained. Christ had summoned myself and others from all heathen tribes. There were more different languages
    than I had ever heard before, and I did not understand any of them.” The delegation of which Porcupine was a member
    was probably the one mentioned by the agent in charge at Pyramid lake as having arrived in the spring of 1890, and
    consisting of thirty-four Indians of different tribes. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 19.</i>)</p>

  <p>In a few days preparations were made for a great dance near Walker lake, with all the delegates from the various
    tribes and hundreds of Indians in attendance. They danced two nights or longer, the messiah himself—Wovoka—coming
    down from his home in Mason valley to lead the ceremony. After the dance Wovoka went into a trance, and on awaking
    announced to those assembled that he had been to the other world and had seen the spirits of their dead friends and
    of his own father and mother, and had been sent back to teach the people. According to Porcupine he claimed to be
    the returned Christ and bore on his body the scars of the crucifixion. He told them that the dead were to be
    resurrected, and that as the earth was old and worn out it would be renewed as it used to be and made better; that
    when this happened the youth of everyone would be renewed with each return of spring, and that they would live
    forever; that there would be universal peace, and that any tribe that refused his message would be destroyed from
    the face of the earth.</p>

  <p>It was early in the spring of 1890 when Porcupine and his Cheyenne companions returned to their tribe at Tongue
    River agency in Montana with the news of the appearance of the messiah. A council was called and Porcupine made a
    full report of the journey and delivered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_819">819</span> divine message,
    talking five days in succession. The report aroused the wildest excitement among the Cheyenne, and after several
    long debates on the subject the Ghost dance was inaugurated at the various camps in accordance with the instructions
    from beyond the mountains. In June the matter came to the attention of the military officer on the reservation, who
    summoned Porcupine before him and obtained from him a full account of the journey and the doctrine. (See <a href="#Page_793">page 793</a>.)
    Porcupine insisted strongly on the sacred character of the messiah and his message, and challenged any doubters to
    return with him to Nevada and investigate for themselves. He claimed also that the messiah could speak all
    languages. As a matter of fact, Wovoka speaks only his native Paiute and a little English, but due allowance must be
    made for the mental exaltation of the narrator.</p>

  <p>Grinnell states that the failure of certain things to happen according to the predictions of the messiah, in
    September, 1890, caused a temporary loss of faith on the part of the Cheyenne, but that shortly afterward some
    visiting Shoshoni and Arapaho from Wyoming reported that in their journey as they came over they had met a party of
    Indians who had been dead thirty or forty years, but had been resurrected by the messiah, and were now going about
    as if they had never died. It is useless to speculate on the mental condition of men who could seriously report or
    believe such things; but, however that may be, the result was that the Cheyenne returned to the dance with redoubled
    fervor. (<i><a href="#JFL">J. F. L.</a>, 5.</i>)</p>

  <p>The Sioux first heard of the messiah in 1889. According to the statement of Captain George Sword, of that tribe,
    the information came to the Ogalala (Sioux of Pine Ridge) in that year, through the Shoshoni and Arapaho. Later in
    the same year a delegation consisting of Good Thunder and several others started out to the west to find the messiah
    and to investigate the truth of the rumor. On their return they announced that the messiah had indeed come to help
    the Indians, but not the whites. Their report aroused a fervor of joyful excitement among the Indians and a second
    delegation was sent out in 1890, consisting of Good Thunder, Cloud Horse, Yellow Knife, and Short Bull. They
    confirmed the report of the first delegation, and on this assurance the Ghost dance was inaugurated among the Sioux
    at Pine Ridge in the spring of 1890.</p>

  <p>The matter is stated differently and more correctly by William Selwyn, an educated Sioux, at that time employed as
    postmaster at Pine Ridge. He says there was some talk on the subject by Indians from western tribes who visited the
    agency in the fall of 1888 (?), but that it did not excite much attention until 1889, when numerous letters
    concerning the new messiah were received by the Indians at Pine Ridge from tribes in Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Dakota,
    and Oklahoma. As Selwyn was postmaster, the Indians who could not read usually brought their letters to him to read
    for them, so that he was thus in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_820">820</span> position to get accurate
    knowledge of the extent and nature of the excitement. It may be remarked here that, under present conditions, when
    the various tribes are isolated upon widely separated reservations, the Ghost dance could never have become so
    widespread, and would probably have died out within a year of its inception, had it not been for the efficient aid
    it received from the returned pupils of various eastern government schools, who conducted the sacred correspondence
    for their friends at the different agencies, acted as interpreters for the delegates to the messiah, and in various
    ways assumed the leadership and conduct of the dance.</p>

  <p>In the fall of 1889, at a council held at Pine Ridge by Red Cloud, Young Man Afraid, Little Wound, American Horse,
    and other Sioux chiefs, a delegation was appointed to visit the western agencies to learn more about the new
    messiah. The delegates chosen were Good Thunder, Flat Iron, Yellow Breast, and Broken Arm, from Pine Ridge; Short
    Bull and another from Rosebud, and Kicking Bear from Cheyenne River agency. They started on their journey to the
    west, and soon began to write from Wyoming, Utah, and beyond the mountains, confirming all that had been said of the
    advent of a redeemer. They were gone all winter, and their return in the spring of 1890 aroused an intense
    excitement among the Sioux, who had been anxiously awaiting their report. All the delegates agreed that there was a
    man near the base of the Sierras who said that he was the son of God, who had once been killed by the whites, and
    who bore on his body the scars of the crucifixion. He had now returned to punish the whites for their wickedness,
    especially for their injustice toward the Indians. With the coming of the next spring (1891) he would wipe the
    whites from the face of the earth, and would then resurrect all the dead Indians, bring back the buffalo and other
    game, and restore the supremacy of the aboriginal race. He had before come to the whites, but they had rejected him.
    He was now the God of the Indians, and they must pray to him and call him “father,” and prepare for his awful
    coming. Selwyn’s account of this delegation, which was accompanied by representatives of several other tribes,
    including Porcupine the Cheyenne, and Sitting Bull the Arapaho, agrees with the statements of the Arapaho as given
    in <a href="#Chapter_XIV">chapter <span class="smcap">xiv</span></a>. Three of the Sioux delegates found their way to Umatilla reservation
    in Oregon and remained there several days discussing the new doctrine. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 30</i>—<i>Dorchester, 529</i>.)</p>

  <p>The delegates made their report at Pine Ridge in April, 1890. A council was at once called to discuss the matter,
    but Selwyn informed the agent, Colonel Gallagher, who had Good Thunder and two others arrested and imprisoned. They
    were held in confinement two days, but refused to talk when questioned. The intended council was not held, but soon
    afterward Kicking Bear returned from a visit to the northern Arapaho in Wyoming with the news that those Indians
    were already dancing, and could see and talk with their dead relatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_821">
    821</span> in the trance. The excitement which the agent had thought to smother by the arrest of the leaders
    broke out again with added strength. Red Cloud himself, the great chief of the Ogalala, declared his adhesion to the
    new doctrine and said his people must do as the messiah had commanded. Another council was called on White Clay
    creek, a few miles from Pine Ridge agency, and the Ghost dance was formally inaugurated among the Sioux, the recent
    delegates acting as priests and leaders of the ceremony.</p>

  <p>As the result of all he could learn, Selwyn, in November, 1890, warned the agent in charge of Yankton agency that
    the Indians intended a general outbreak in the spring. Six months earlier, and before Porcupine’s statement had been
    made to the officer at Camp Crook, a letter dated May 29, 1890, had been addressed to the Interior Department from a
    citizen of Pierre, South Dakota, stating that the Sioux, or a portion of them, were secretly planning for an
    outbreak in the near future. This was the first intimation of trouble ahead. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 20.</i>)</p>

  <p>Wonderful things were said of the messiah by the returned delegates. It was claimed that he could make animals talk
    and distant objects appear close at hand, and that he came down from heaven in a cloud. He conjured up before their
    eyes a vision of the spirit world, so that when they looked they beheld an ocean, and beyond it a land upon which
    they saw “all the nations of Indians coming home,” but as they looked the vision faded away, the messiah saying that
    the time had not yet come. Curiously enough, although he came to restore the old life, he advised his hearers to go
    to work and to send their children to school. Should the soldiers attempt to harm him, he said he need only stretch
    out his arms and his enemies would become powerless, or the ground would open and swallow them. On their way home if
    they should kill a buffalo—the messiah had evidently not read Allen’s monograph—they must cut off its head and tail
    and feet and leave them on the ground and the buffalo would come to life again. They must tell their people to
    follow his instructions. Unbelievers and renegade Indians would be buried under the new earth which was to come upon
    the old. They must use the sacred red and white paint and the sacred grass (possibly sagebrush) which he gave them,
    and in the spring, when the green grass came, their people who were gone before would return, and they would see
    their friends again.</p>

  <p>Now comes the most remarkable part, quoting from the statement given to Captain Sword:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The people from every tipi send for us to visit them; they are people who died many years ago. Chasing Hawk, who
      died not long ago, was there and we went to his tipi. He was living with his wife, who was killed in war long ago.
      They live in a buffalo skin tipi—a very large one—and he wanted all his friends to go there to live. A son of Good
      Thunder, who died in war long ago, was one who also took us to his tipi, so his father saw him. When coming we
      come to a herd of buffaloes. We killed one and took everything except the four feet, head, and tail, and when we
      came a little ways from it there was the buffaloes come to life again and went off. This <span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_822">822</span>was one of the messiah’s word came to truth. The messiah said, “I will short your
      journey when you feel tired of the long ways, if you call upon me.” This we did when we were tired. The night came
      upon us, we stopped at a place and we called upon the messiah to help us because we were tired of long journey. We
      went to sleep and in the morning we found ourselves at a great distance from where we stopped.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is useless to assert that these men, who had been selected by the chiefs of their tribe to investigate and
    report upon the truth or falsity of the messiah rumors, were all liars, and that all the Cheyenne, Arapaho, and
    other delegates who reported equally wonderful things were liars likewise. They were simply laboring under some
    strange psychologic influence as yet unexplained. The story of the revivified buffalo became so widely current as to
    form the subject of a Kiowa ghost song.</p>

  <p>Having mentioned some characteristics of the Ghost dance west of the Rockies, we shall notice here some of the
    peculiar features of the dance as it existed among the Sioux. The ceremony will be described in detail later on.</p>

  <p>Before going into the dance the men, or at least the leaders, fasted for twenty-four hours, and then at sunrise
    entered the sweat-house for the religious rite of purification preliminary to painting themselves for the dance. The
    sweat-house is a small circular framework of willow branches driven into the ground and bent over and brought
    together at the top in such a way that when covered with blankets or buffalo robes the structure forms a diminutive
    round-top tipi just high enough to enable several persons to sit or to stand in a stooping posture inside. The
    doorway faces the east, as is the rule in Indian structures, and at the distance of a few feet in front of the
    doorway is a small mound of earth, on which is placed a buffalo skull, with the head turned as if looking into the
    lodge. The earth of which the mound is formed is taken from a hole dug in the center of the lodge. Near the
    sweat-house, on the outside, there is frequently a tall sacrifice pole, from the top of which are hung strips of
    bright-colored cloth, packages of tobacco, or other offerings to the deity invoked by the devotee on any particular
    occasion.</p>

  <p>The sweat bath is in frequent use, both as a religious rite of purification and as a hygienic treatment. Like
    everything else in Indian life, even the sanitary application is attended with much detail of religious ceremony.
    Fresh bundles of the fragrant wild sage are strewn upon the ground inside of the sweat-house, and a fire is kindled
    outside a short distance away. In this fire stones are heated by the medicine-men, and when all is ready the patient
    or devotee, stripped to the breechcloth, enters the sweat-house. The stones are then handed in to him by the priests
    by means of two forked sticks, cut especially for the purpose, and with two other forked sticks he puts the stones
    into the hole already mentioned as having been dug in the center of the lodge. Water is then passed in to him, which
    he pours over the hot stones until the whole interior is filled with steam; the blankets are pulled <span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_823">823</span>tight to close every opening, and he sits in this aboriginal Turkish
    bath until his naked body is dripping with perspiration. During this time the doctors outside are doing their part
    in the way of praying to the gods and keeping up the supply of hot stones and water until in their estimation he has
    been sufficiently purified, physically or morally, when he emerges and resumes his clothing, sometimes first
    checking the perspiration and inducing a reaction by a plunge into the neighboring stream. The sweat bath in one
    form or another was common to almost every tribe in the United States, but as an accompaniment to the Ghost dance it
    seems to have been used only by the Sioux. It may have been used in this connection among the Shoshoni or northern
    Cheyenne, but was not among any of the tribes of the southern plains. The Ghost-dance sweat-house of the Sioux was
    frequently made sufficiently large to accommodate a considerable number of persons standing inside at the same time.</p>

  <figure class="illowp100" id="plate_xciv">

    <img class="figbox" src="images/plate_xciv.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="xsmall">SIOUX SWEAT-HOUSE AND SACRIFICE POLE</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>After the sweating ceremony the dancer was painted by the medicine-men who acted as leaders, of whom Sitting Bull
    was accounted the greatest among the Sioux. The design and color varied with the individual, being frequently
    determined by a previous trance vision of the subject, but circles, crescents, and crosses, representing
    respectively the sun, the moon, and the morning star, were always favorite figures upon forehead, face, and cheeks.
    As this was not a naked dance, the rest of the body was not usually painted. After the painting the dancer was robed
    in the sacred ghost shirt already described. This also was painted with, symbolic figures, among which were usually
    represented sun, moon, or stars, the eagle, magpie, crow, or sage-hen, all sacred to the Ghost dance among the
    Sioux. In connection with the painting the face and body were rubbed with the sweet-smelling vernal grass
    (<i>Hierochloe</i>), used for this purpose by many of the prairie tribes, and sometimes also burned as incense in
    their sacred ceremonies or carried as a perfume in small pouches attached to the clothing.</p>

  <p>The painting occupied most of the morning, so that it was about noon before the participants formed the circle for
    the dance. Among the Sioux, unlike the southern and western tribes generally, a small tree was planted in the center
    of the circle, with an American flag or colored streamers floating from the top. Around the base of this tree sat
    the priests. At a great dance at No Water’s camp on White river near Pine Ridge, shortly before the arrival of the
    troops, a young woman standing within the circle gave the signal for the performance by shooting into the air toward
    the cardinal points four sacred arrows, made after the old primitive fashion with bone heads, and dipped in the
    blood of a steer before being brought to the dance. These were then gathered up and tied to the branches of the
    tree, together with the bow, a gaming wheel and sticks, and a peculiar staff or wand with horns. (See plates <a href="#plate_xc"><span
    class="smcap">xc</span></a>, <a href="#plate_xci"><span class="smcap">xci</span></a>.) Another young woman, or the same one, remained
    standing near the tree throughout the dance, holding a sacred redstone pipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_824">
    824</span> stretched out toward the west, the direction from which the messiah was to appear.</p>

  <p>At the beginning the performers, men and women, sat on the ground in a large circle around the tree. A plaintive
    chant was then sung, after which a vessel of some sacred food was passed around the circle until everyone had
    partaken, when, at a signal by the priests, the dancers rose to their feet, joined hands, and began to chant the
    opening song and move slowly around the circle from right to left. The rest of the performance, with its frenzies,
    trances, and recitals of visions, was the same as with the southern tribes, as will be described in detail
    hereafter. Like these tribes also, the Sioux usually selected Sunday, the great medicine day of the white man, for
    the ceremony.</p>

  <p class="p2">We come now to the Sioux outbreak of 1890, but before going into the history of this short but costly war it is
    appropriate to state briefly the causes of the outbreak. In the documentary appendix to this chapter these causes
    are fully set forth by competent authorities—civilian, military, missionary, and Indian. They may be summarized as
    (1) unrest of the conservative element under the decay of the old life, (2) repeated neglect of promises made by the
    government, and (3) hunger.</p>

  <p>The Sioux are the largest and strongest tribe within the United States. In spite of wars, removals, and diminished
    food supply since the advent of the white man, they still number nearly 26,000. In addition to these there are about
    600 more residing in Canada. They formerly held the headwaters of the Mississippi, extending eastward almost to Lake
    Superior, but were driven into the prairie about two centuries ago by their enemies, the Ojibwa, after the latter
    had obtained firearms from the French. On coming out on the buffalo plains they became possessed of the horse, by
    means of which reinforcement to their own overpowering numbers the Sioux were soon enabled to assume the offensive,
    and in a short time had made themselves the undisputed masters of an immense territory extending, in a general way,
    from Minnesota to the Rocky mountains and from the Yellowstone to the Platte. A few small tribes were able to
    maintain their position within these limits, but only by keeping close to their strongly built permanent villages on
    the Missouri. Millions of buffalo to furnish unlimited food supply, thousands of horses, and hundreds of miles of
    free range made the Sioux, up to the year 1868, the richest and most prosperous, the proudest, and withal, perhaps,
    the wildest of all the tribes of the plains.</p>

  <p>In that year, in pursuance of a policy inaugurated for bringing all the plains tribes under the direct control of
    the government, a treaty was negotiated with the Sioux living west of the Missouri by which they renounced their
    claims to a great part of their territory and had “set apart for their absolute and undisturbed use and
    occupation”—so the treaty states—a reservation which embraced all of the present state of South Dakota west of
    Missouri river. At the same time agents were appointed and agencies established for them; annuities and
    rations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_825">825</span> cows, physicians, farmers, teachers, and other good
    things were promised them, and they agreed to allow railroad routes to be surveyed and built and military posts to
    be established in their territory and neighborhood. At one stroke they were reduced from a free nation to dependent
    wards of the government. It was stipulated also that they should be allowed to hunt within their old range, outside
    the limits of the reservation, so long as the buffalo abounded—a proviso which, to the Indians, must have meant
    forever.</p>

  <p>The reservation thus established was an immense one, and would have been ample for all the Sioux while being
    gradually educated toward civilization, could the buffalo have remained and the white man kept away. But the times
    were changing. The building of the railroads brought into the plains swarms of hunters and emigrants, who began to
    exterminate the buffalo at such a rate that in a few years the Sioux, with all the other hunting tribes of the
    plains, realized that their food supply was rapidly going. Then gold was discovered in the Black hills, within the
    reservation, and at once thousands of miners and other thousands of lawless desperadoes rushed into the country in
    defiance of the protests of the Indians and the pledges of the government, and the Sioux saw their last remaining
    hunting ground taken from them. The result was the Custer war and massacre, and a new agreement in 1876 by which the
    Sioux were shorn of one-third of their guaranteed reservation, including the Black hills, and this led to deep and
    widespread dissatisfaction throughout the tribe. The conservatives brooded over the past and planned opposition to
    further changes which they felt themselves unable to meet. The progressives felt that the white man’s promises meant
    nothing.</p>

  <p>On this point Commissioner Morgan says, in his statement of the causes of the outbreak:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Prior to the agreement of 1876 buffalo and deer were the main support of the Sioux. Food, tents, bedding were the
      direct outcome of hunting, and with furs and pelts as articles of barter or exchange it was easy for the Sioux to
      procure whatever constituted for them the necessaries, the comforts, or even the luxuries of life. Within eight
      years from the agreement of 1876 the buffalo had gone and the Sioux had left to them alkali land and government
      rations. It is hard to overestimate the magnitude of the calamity, as they viewed it, which happened to these
      people by the sudden disappearance of the buffalo and the large diminution in the numbers of deer and other wild
      animals. Suddenly, almost without warning, they were expected at once and without previous training to settle down
      to the pursuits of agriculture in a land largely unfitted for such use. The freedom of the chase was to be
      exchanged for the idleness of the camp. The boundless range was to be abandoned for the circumscribed reservation,
      and abundance of plenty to be supplanted by limited and decreasing government subsistence and supplies. Under
      these circumstances it is not in human nature not to be discontented and restless, even turbulent and violent.
      (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 28.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It took our own Aryan ancestors untold centuries to develop from savagery into civilization. Was it reasonable to
    expect that the Sioux could do the same in fourteen years?</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_826">826</span></p>

  <p>The white population in the Black hills had rapidly increased, and it had become desirable to open communication
    between eastern and western Dakota. To accomplish this, it was proposed to cut out the heart of the Sioux
    reservation, and in 1882, only six years after the Black hills had been seized, the Sioux were called on to
    surrender more territory. A commission was sent out to treat with them, but the price offered—only about 8 cents per
    acre—was so absurdly small, and the methods used so palpably unjust, that friends of the Indians interposed and
    succeeded in defeating the measure in Congress. Another agreement was prepared, but experience had made the Indians
    suspicious, and it was not until a third commission went out, under the chairmanship of General Crook, known to the
    Indians as a brave soldier and an honorable man, that the Sioux consented to treat. (<i><a href="#Welsh">Welsh</a>, 1.</i>) The result,
    after much effort on the part of the commission and determined opposition by the conservatives, was another
    agreement, in 1889, by which the Sioux surrendered one-half (about 11,000,000 acres) of their remaining territory,
    and the great reservation was cut up into five smaller ones, the northern and southern reservations being separated
    by a strip 60 miles wide.</p>

  <p>Then came a swift accumulation of miseries. Dakota is an arid country with thin soil and short seasons. Although
    well adapted to grazing it is not suited to agriculture, as is sufficiently proven by the fact that the white
    settlers in that and the adjoining state of Nebraska have several times been obliged to call for state or federal
    assistance on account of failure of crops. To wild Indians hardly in from the warpath the problem was much more
    serious. As General Miles points out in his official report, thousands of white settlers after years of successive
    failures had given up the struggle and left the country, but the Indians, confined to reservations, were unable to
    emigrate, and were also as a rule unable to find employment, as the whites might, by which they could earn a
    subsistence. The buffalo was gone. They must depend on their cattle, their crops, and the government rations issued
    in return for the lands they had surrendered. If these failed, they must starve. The highest official authorities
    concur in the statement that all of these did fail, and that the Indians were driven to outbreak by starvation. (See
    appendix to this chapter.)</p>

  <p>In 1888 their cattle had been diminished by disease. In 1889 their crops were a failure, owing largely to the fact
    that the Indians had been called into the agency in the middle of the farming season and kept there to treat with
    the commission, going back afterward to find their fields trampled and torn up by stock during their absence. Then
    followed epidemics of measles, grippe, and whooping cough, in rapid succession and with terribly fatal results.
    Anyone who understands the Indian character needs not the testimony of witnesses to know the mental effect thus
    produced. Sullenness and gloom, amounting almost to despair, settled down on the Sioux, especially among the
    wilder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_827">827</span> portion. “The people said their children were all dying
    from the face of the earth, and they might as well be killed at once.” Then came another entire failure of crops in
    1890, and an unexpected reduction of rations, and the Indians were brought face to face with starvation. They had
    been expressly and repeatedly told by the commission that their rations would not be affected by their signing the
    treaty, but immediately on the consummation of the agreement Congress cut down their beef rations by 2,000,000
    pounds at Rosebud, 1,000,000 at Pine Ridge, and in less proportion at other agencies. Earnest protest against this
    reduction was made by the commission which had negotiated the treaty, by Commissioner Morgan, and by General Miles,
    but still Congress failed to remedy the matter until the Sioux had actually been driven to rebellion. As
    Commissioner Morgan states, “It was not until January, 1891, <i>after the troubles</i>, that an appropriation of
    $100,000 was made by Congress for additional beef for the Sioux.” The protest of the commission, a full year before
    the outbreak, as quoted by Commissioner Morgan (see <a href="#Page_829">page 829</a>), is strong and positive on this point.</p>

  <p>Commissioner Morgan, while claiming that the Sioux had before been receiving more rations than they were justly
    entitled to according to their census number, and denying that the reduction was such as to cause even extreme
    suffering, yet states that the reduction was especially unwise at this juncture, as it was in direct violation of
    the promises made to the Indians, and would be used as an argument by those opposed to the treaty to show that the
    government cared nothing for the Indians after it had obtained their lands. It is quite possible that the former
    number of rations was greater than the actual number of persons, as it is always a difficult matter to count roving
    Indians, and the difficulties were greater when the old census was made. The census is taken at long intervals and
    the tendency is nearly always toward a decrease. Furthermore, it has usually been the policy with agents to hold
    their Indians quiet by keeping them as well fed as possible. On the other hand, it must be remembered that the issue
    is based on the weight of the cattle as delivered at the agency in the fall, and that months of exposure to a Dakota
    winter will reduce this weight by several hundred pounds to the animal. The official investigation by Captain Hurst
    at Cheyenne River agency shows conclusively that the essential food items of meat, flour, and coffee were far below
    the amount stipulated by the treaty. (See <a href="#Page_837">page 837</a>.)</p>

  <p>In regard to the effect of this food deficiency Bishop Hare says: “The people were often hungry and, the physicians
    in many cases said, died, when taken sick, not so much from disease as for want of food.” General Miles says: “The
    fact that they had not received sufficient food is admitted by the agents and the officers of the government who
    have had opportunities of knowing,” and in another place he states that in spite of crop failures and other
    difficulties, after the sale of the reservation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_828">828</span> “instead of an
    increase, or even a reasonable supply for their support, they have been compelled to live on half and two-thirds
    rations and received nothing for the surrender of their lands.” The testimony from every agency is all to the same
    effect.</p>

  <p>There were other causes of dissatisfaction, some local and others general and chronic, which need not be detailed
    here. Some of these are treated in the documents appended to this chapter. Prominent among them were the failure of
    Congress to make payment of the money due the Sioux for the lands recently ceded, or to have the new lines surveyed
    promptly so that the Indians might know what was still theirs and select their allotments accordingly; failure to
    reimburse the friendly Indians for horses confiscated fourteen years before; the tardy arrival of annuities,
    consisting largely of winter clothing, which according to the treaty were due by the 1st of August, but which seldom
    arrived until the middle of winter; the sweeping and frequent changes of agency employees from the agent down,
    preventing anything like a systematic working out of any consistent policy, and almost always operating against the
    good of the service, especially at Pine Ridge, where so brave and efficient a man as McGillycuddy was followed by
    such a one as Royer—and, finally, the Ghost dance.</p>

  <p>The Ghost dance itself, in the form which it assumed among the Sioux, was only a symptom and expression of the real
    causes of dissatisfaction, and with such a man as McGillycuddy or McLaughlin in charge at Pine Ridge there would
    have been no outbreak, in spite of broken promises and starvation, and the Indians could have been controlled until
    Congress had afforded relief. That it was not the cause of the outbreak is sufficiently proved by the fact that
    there was no serious trouble, excepting on the occasion of the attempt to arrest Sitting Bull, on any other of the
    Sioux reservations, and none at all among any of the other Ghost-dancing tribes from the Missouri to the Sierras,
    although the doctrine and the dance were held by nearly every tribe within that area and are still held by the more
    important. Among the Paiute, where the doctrine originated and the messiah has his home, there was never the
    slightest trouble. It is significant that Commissioner Morgan in his official statement of the causes of the
    outbreak places the “messiah craze” eleventh in a list of twelve, the twelfth being the alarm created by the
    appearance of troops. The Sioux outbreak of 1890 was due entirely to local grievances, recent or long standing. The
    remedy and preventive for similar trouble in the future is sufficiently indicated in the appended statements of
    competent authorities.</p>

  <h3 id="Appendix_XII">APPENDIX—CAUSES OF THE OUTBREAK</h3>

  <h4 id="Commissioner_Morgans_statement">COMMISSIONER MORGAN’S STATEMENT</h4>

  <div class="center">[<i>From the Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for 1891, Vol. I, 132–135.</i>]</div>

  <p>In stating the events which led to this outbreak among the Sioux, the endeavor too often has been merely to find
    some opportunity for locating blame. The causes are complex, and many are obscure and remote. Among them may be
    named the following:</p>

  <p>First. A feeling of unrest and apprehension in the mind of the Indians has naturally grown out of the rapid advance
    in civilization and the great changes which this advance has necessitated in their habits and mode of life.</p>

  <p>Second. Prior to the agreement of 1876 buffalo and deer were the main support of the Sioux. Food, tents, bedding
    were the direct outcome of hunting, and, with furs and pelts as articles of barter or exchange, it was easy for the
    Sioux to procure whatever constituted for them the necessaries, the comforts, or even the luxuries of life. Within
    eight years from the agreement of 1876 the buffalo had gone, and the Sioux had left to them alkali land and
    government rations. It is hard to overestimate the magnitude of the calamity, as they viewed it, which happened to
    these people by the sudden disappearance of the buffalo and the large diminution in the numbers of deer and other
    wild animals. Suddenly, almost without warning, they were expected at once and without previous training to settle
    down to the pursuits of agriculture in a land largely unfitted for such use. The freedom of the chase was to be
    exchanged for the idleness of the camp. The boundless range was to be abandoned for the circumscribed reservation,
    and abundance of plenty to be supplanted by limited and decreasing government subsistence and supplies. Under these
    circumstances it is not in human nature not to be discontented and restless, even turbulent and violent.</p>

  <p>Third. During a long series of years, treaties, agreements, cessions of land and privileges, and removals of bands
    and agencies have kept many of the Sioux, particularly those at Pine Ridge and Rosebud, in an unsettled condition,
    especially as some of the promises made them were fulfilled tardily or not at all. (A brief history of negotiations
    with the Sioux was given in my letter of December 24, 1890, to the Department, which will be found in the appendix,
    page 182.)</p>

  <p>Fourth. The very large reduction of the great Sioux reservation, brought about by the Sioux commission through the
    consent of the large majority of the adult males, was bitterly opposed by a large, influential minority. For various
    reasons, they regarded the cession as unwise, and did all in their power to prevent its consummation, and afterwards
    were constant in their expressions of dissatisfaction and in their endeavors to awaken a like feeling in the minds
    of those who signed the agreement.</p>

  <p>Fifth. There was diminution and partial failure of the crops for 1889, by reason of their neglect by the Indians,
    who were congregated in large numbers at the council with the Sioux commission, and a further diminution of ordinary
    crops by the drought of 1890. Also, in 1888, the disease of black leg appeared among the cattle of the Indians.</p>

  <p>Sixth. At this time, by delayed and reduced appropriations, the Sioux rations were temporarily cut down. Rations
    were not diminished to such an extent as to bring the Indians to starvation or even extreme suffering, as has been
    often reported; but short rations came just after the Sioux commission had negotiated the agreement for the cession
    of lands, and, as a condition of securing the signatures of the majority, had assured the Indians that their rations
    would be continued unchanged. To this matter the Sioux commission called special attention in their report dated
    December 24, 1889, as follows:</p>

  <p>“During our conference at the different agencies we were repeatedly asked whether the acceptance or rejection of
    the act of Congress would influence the action of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_830">830</span> government
    with reference to their rations, and in every instance the Indians were assured that subsistence was furnished in
    accordance with former treaties, and that signing would not affect their rations, and that they would continue to
    receive them as provided in former treaties. Without our assurances to this effect it would have been impossible to
    have secured their consent to the cession of their lands. Since our visit to the agencies it appears that large
    reductions have been made in the amounts of beef furnished for issues, amounting at Rosebud to 2,000,000 pounds and
    at Pine Ridge to 1,000,000 pounds, and lesser amounts at the other agencies. This action of the Department,
    following immediately after the successful issue of our negotiations, can not fail to have an injurious effect. It
    will be impossible to convince the Indians that the reduction is not due to the fact that the government, having
    obtained their land, has less concern in looking after their material interests than before. It will be looked upon
    as a breach of faith and especially as a violation of the express statements of the commissioners. Already this
    action is being used by the Indians opposed to the bill, notably at Pine Ridge, as an argument in support of the
    wisdom of their opposition.”</p>

  <p>In forwarding this report to Congress the Department called special attention to the above-quoted statements of the
    commission and said: “The commission further remarks that as to the quality of the rations furnished there seems to
    be no just cause for complaint, but that it was particularly to be avoided that there should be any diminution of
    the rations promised under the former treaties at this time, as the Indians would attribute it to their assent to
    the bill. Such diminution certainly should not be allowed, as the government is bound in good faith to carry into
    effect the former treaties where not directly and positively affected by the act, and if under the provisions of the
    treaty itself the ration is at any time reduced, the commissioners recommend that the Indians should be notified
    before spring opens, so that crops may be cultivated. It is desirable that the recent reduction made should be
    restored, as it is now impossible to convince the Indians that it was not due to the fact that the government,
    having obtained their lands, had less concern in looking after their material interests.”</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding this plea of the commission and of the Department, the appropriation made for the subsistence and
    civilization of the Sioux for 1890 was only $950,000, or $50,000 less than the amount estimated and appropriated for
    1888 and 1889, and the appropriation not having been made until August 19, rations had to be temporarily purchased
    and issued in limited quantities pending arrival of new supplies to be secured from that appropriation. It was not
    until January, 1891, after the troubles, that an appropriation of $100,000 was made by Congress for additional beef
    for the Sioux.</p>

  <p>Seventh. Other promises made by the Sioux commission and the agreement were not promptly fulfilled; among them were
    increase of appropriations for education, for which this office had asked an appropriation of $150,000; the payment
    of $200,000 in compensation for ponies taken from the Sioux in 1876 and 1877; and the reimbursement of the Crow
    Creek Indians for a reduction made in their per capita allowance of land, as compared with the amount allowed other
    Sioux, which called for an appropriation of $187,039. The fulfillment of all these promises except the last named
    was contained in the act of January 19, 1891.</p>

  <p>Eighth. In 1889 and 1890 epidemics of la grippe, measles, and whooping cough, followed by many deaths, added to the
    gloom and misfortune which seemed to surround the Indians.</p>

  <p>Ninth. The wording of the agreement changed the boundary line between the Rosebud and Pine Ridge diminished
    reservations and necessitated a removal of a portion of the Rosebud Indians from the lands which, by the agreement,
    were included in the Pine Ridge reservation to lands offered them in lieu thereof upon the diminished Rosebud
    reserve. This, although involving no great hardship to any considerable number, added to the discontent.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_831">831</span></p>

  <p>Tenth. Some of the Indians were greatly opposed to the census which Congress ordered should be taken. The census at
    Rosebud, as reported by Special Agent Lea and confirmed by a special census taken by Agent Wright, revealed the
    somewhat startling fact that rations had been issued to Indians very largely in excess of the number actually
    present, and this diminution of numbers as shown by the census necessitated a diminution of the rations, which was
    based, of course, upon the census.</p>

  <p>Eleventh. The Messiah craze, which fostered the belief that “ghost shirts” would be invulnerable to bullets, and
    that the supremacy of the Indian race was assured, added to discontent the fervor of fanaticism and brought those
    who accepted the new faith into the attitude of sullen defiance, but defensive rather than aggressive.</p>

  <p>Twelfth. The sudden appearance of military upon their reservation gave rise to the wildest rumors among the Indians
    of danger and disaster, which were eagerly circulated by disaffected Indians and corroborated by exaggerated
    accounts in the newspapers, and these and other influences connected with and inseparable from military movements
    frightened many Indians away from their agencies into the bad lands and largely intensified whatever spirit of
    opposition to the government existed.</p>

  <h4 id="McGillycuddys_statement">EX-AGENT McGILLYCUDDY’S STATEMENT</h4>

  <p class="hang">[<i>Letter of Dr V. T. McGillycuddy, formerly agent at Pine Ridge, written in reply to inquiry from General L. W.
    Colby, commanding Nebraska state troops during the outbreak, and dated January 15, 1891. From article on “The
    Sioux Indian War of 1890–91,” by General L. W. Colby, in Transactions and Reports of the Nebraska State
    Historical Society, III, 1892, pages 176–180.</i>]</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In answer to your inquiry of a recent date, I would state that in my opinion to no
    one cause can be attributed the recent so-called outbreak on the part of the Sioux, but rather to a combination of
    causes gradually cumulative in their effect and dating back through many years—in fact to the inauguration of our
    practically demonstrated faulty Indian policy.</p>

  <p>There can be no question but that many of the treaties, agreements, or solemn promises made by our government with
    these Indians have been broken. Many of them have been kept by us technically, but as far as the Indian is concerned
    have been misunderstood by him through a lack of proper explanation at time of signing, and hence considered by him
    as broken.</p>

  <p>It must also be remembered that in all of the treaties made by the government with the Indians, a large portion of
    them have not agreed to or signed the same. Noticeably was this so in the agreement secured by us with them the
    summer before last, by which we secured one-half of the remainder of the Sioux reserve, amounting to about 16,000
    square miles. This agreement barely carried with the Sioux nation as a whole, but did not carry at Pine Ridge or
    Rosebud, where the strong majority were against it; and it must be noted that wherever there was the strongest
    opposition manifested to the recent treaty, there, during the present trouble, have been found the elements opposed
    to the government.</p>

  <p>The Sioux nation, which at one time, with the confederated bands of Cheyennes and Arapahos, controlled a region of
    country bounded on the north by the Yellowstone, on the south by the Arkansas, and reaching from the Missouri river
    to the Rocky mountains, has seen this large domain, under the various treaties, dwindle down to their now limited
    reserve of less than 16,000 square miles, and with the land has disappeared the buffalo and other game. The memory
    of this, chargeable by them to the white man, necessarily irritates them.</p>

  <p>There is back of all this the natural race antagonism which our dealings with the aborigine in connection with the
    inevitable onward march of civilization has in no degree lessened. It has been our experience, and the experience of
    other nations, that defeat in war is soon, not sooner or later, forgotten by the coming generation, and as a result
    we have a tendency to a constant recurrence of outbreak on the part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_832">
    832</span> of the weaker race. It is now sixteen years since our last war with the Sioux in 1876—a time when our
    present Sioux warriors were mostly children, and therefore have no memory of having felt the power of the
    government. It is but natural that these young warriors, lacking in experience, should require but little incentive
    to induce them to test the bravery of the white man on the war path, where the traditions of his people teach him is
    the only path to glory and a chosen seat in the “happy hunting grounds.” For these reasons every precaution should
    be adopted by the government to guard against trouble with its disastrous results. Have such precautions been
    adopted? Investigation of the present trouble does not so indicate.</p>

  <p>Sitting Bull and other irreconcilable relics of the campaign of 1876 were allowed to remain among their people and
    foment discord. The staple article of food at Pine Ridge and some of the other agencies had been cut down below the
    subsisting point, noticeably the beef at Pine Ridge, which from an annual treaty allowance of 6,250,000 pounds gross
    was cut down to 4,000,000 pounds. The contract on that beef was violated, insomuch as that contract called for
    northern ranch beef, for which was substituted through beef from Texas, with an unparalleled resulting shrinkage in
    winter, so that the Indians did not actually receive half ration of this food in winter—the very time the largest
    allowance of food is required. By the fortunes of political war, weak agents were placed in charge of some of the
    agencies at the very time that trouble was known to be brewing. Noticeably was this so at Pine Ridge, where a
    notoriously weak and unfit man was placed in charge. His flight, abandonment of his agency, and his call for troops
    have, with the horrible results of the same, become facts in history.</p>

  <p>Now, as for facts in connection with Pine Ridge, which agency has unfortunately become the theater of the present
    “war,” was there necessity for troops? My past experience with those Indians does not so indicate. For seven long
    years, from 1879 to 1886, I, as agent, managed this agency without the presence of a soldier on the reservation, and
    none nearer than 60 miles, and in those times the Indians were naturally much wilder than they are to-day. To be
    sure, during the seven years we occasionally had exciting times, when the only thing lacking to cause an outbreak
    was the calling for troops by the agent and the presence of the same. As a matter of fact, however, no matter how
    much disturbed affairs were, no matter how imminent an outbreak, the progressive chiefs, with their following, came
    to the front enough in the majority, with the fifty Indian policemen, to at once crush out all attempts at rebellion
    against the authority of the agent and the government.</p>

  <p>Why was this? Because in those times we believed in placing confidence in the Indians; in establishing, as far as
    possible, a home-rule government on the reservation. We established local courts, presided over by the Indians, with
    Indian juries; in fact, we believed in having the Indians assist in working out their own salvation. We courted and
    secured the friendship and support of the progressive and orderly element, as against the mob element. Whether the
    system thus inaugurated was practicable, was successful, comparison with recent events will decide.</p>

  <p>When my Democratic successor took charge in 1886, he deemed it necessary to make general changes in the system at
    Pine Ridge, i.&nbsp;e., a Republican system. All white men, half-breeds, or Indians who had sustained the agent under the
    former administration were classed as Republicans and had to go. The progressive chiefs, such as Young Man Afraid,
    Little Wound, and White Bird, were ignored, and the backing of the element of order and progress was alienated from
    the agent and the government, and in the place of this strong backing that had maintained order for seven years was
    substituted Red Cloud and other nonprogressive chiefs, sustainers of the ancient tribal system.</p>

  <p>If my successor had been other than an amateur, or had had any knowledge or experience in the inside Indian
    politics of an Indian tribe, he would have known that if the element he was endeavoring to relegate to the rear had
    not been the balance of power, I could not for seven years have held out against the mob element which he now sought
    to put in power. In other words, he unwittingly threw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_833">833</span> balance
    of power at Pine Ridge against the government, as he later on discovered to his cost. When still later he endeavored
    to maintain order and suppress the ghost dance, the attempt resulted in a most dismal failure.</p>

  <p>The Democratic agent was succeeded in October last by the recently removed Republican agent, a gentleman totally
    ignorant of Indians and their peculiarities; a gentleman with not a qualification in his make-up calculated to fit
    him for the position of agent at one of the largest and most difficult agencies in the service to manage; a man
    selected solely as a reward for political services. He might possibly have been an average success as an Indian
    agent at a small, well-regulated agency. He endeavored to strengthen up matters, but the chiefs and leaders who
    could have assisted him in so doing had been alienated by the former agent. They virtually said among themselves,
    “We, after incurring the enmity of the bad element among our people by sustaining the government, have been ignored
    and ill-treated by that government, hence this is not our affair.” Being ignorant of the situation, he had no one to
    depend on. In his first clash with the mob element he discovered that the Pine Ridge police, formerly the finest in
    the service, were lacking in discipline and courage, and, not being well supplied with those necessary qualities
    himself, he took the bluff of a mob for a declaration of war, abandoned his agency, returned with troops—and you see
    the result.</p>

  <p>As for the ghost dance, too much attention has been paid to it. It was only the symptom or surface indication of
    deep-rooted, long-existing difficulty; as well treat the eruption of smallpox as the disease and ignore the
    constitutional disease.</p>

  <p>As regards disarming the Sioux, however desirable it may appear, I consider it neither advisable nor practicable. I
    fear that it will result as the theoretical enforcement of prohibition in Kansas, Iowa, and Dakota; you will succeed
    in disarming the friendly Indians, because you can, and you will not so succeed with the mob element, because you
    can not. If I were again to be an Indian agent and had my choice, I would take charge of 10,000 armed Sioux in
    preference to a like number of disarmed ones; and, furthermore, agree to handle that number, or the whole Sioux
    nation, without a white soldier.</p>

    <span class="smcap">V. T. McGillycuddy</span>.</span></p>

  <p>P.S.—I neglected to state that up to date there has been neither a Sioux outbreak nor war. No citizen in Nebraska
    or Dakota has been killed, molested, or can show the scratch of a pin, and no property has been destroyed off the
    reservation.</p>

  <h4 id="Statement_of_General_Miles">STATEMENT OF GENERAL MILES</h4>

  <p class="hang">[<i>From the Report of the Secretary of War for 1891, Vol. I, pp. 133, 134, and 149. He enumerates specific
    causes of complaint at each of the principal Sioux agencies, all of which causes may be summarized as hunger and
    unfulfilled promises.</i>]</p>

  <p><i>Cause of Indian dissatisfaction.</i>—The causes that led to the serious disturbance of the peace in the
    northwest last autumn and winter were so remarkable that an explanation of them is necessary in order to comprehend
    the seriousness of the situation. The Indians assuming the most threatening attitude of hostility were the Cheyennes
    and Sioux. Their condition may be stated as follows: For several years following their subjugation in 1877, 1878,
    and 1879 the most dangerous element of the Cheyennes and the Sioux were under military control. Many of them were
    disarmed and dismounted; their war ponies were sold and the proceeds returned to them in domestic stock, farming
    utensils, wagons, etc. Many of the Cheyennes, under the charge of military officers, were located on land in
    accordance with the laws of Congress, but after they were turned over to civil agents and the vast herds of buffalo
    and large game had been destroyed their supplies were insufficient, and they were forced to kill cattle belonging to
    white people to sustain life.</p>

  <p>The fact that they had not received sufficient food is admitted by the agents and the officers of the government
    who have had opportunities of knowing. The majority of the Sioux were under the charge of civil agents, frequently
    changed and often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_834">834</span> inexperienced. Many of the tribes became
    rearmed and remounted. They claimed that the government had not fulfilled its treaties and had failed to make large
    enough appropriations for their support; that they had suffered for want of food, and the evidence of this is beyond
    question and sufficient to satisfy any unprejudiced intelligent mind. The statements of officers, inspectors, both
    of the military and the Interior departments, of agents, of missionaries, and civilians familiar with their
    condition, leave no room for reasonable doubt that this was one of the principal causes. While statements may be
    made as to the amount of money that has been expended by the government to feed the different tribes, the manner of
    distributing those appropriations will furnish one reason for the deficit.</p>

  <p>The unfortunate failure of the crops in the plains country during the years of 1889 and 1890 added to the distress
    and suffering of the Indians, and it was possible for them to raise but very little from the ground for
    self-support; in fact, white settlers have been most unfortunate, and their losses have been serious and universal
    throughout a large section of that country. They have struggled on from year to year; occasionally they would raise
    good crops, which they were compelled to sell at low prices, while in the season of drought their labor was almost
    entirely lost. So serious have been their misfortunes that thousands have left that country within the last few
    years, passing over the mountains to the Pacific slope or returning to the east of the Missouri or the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>The Indians, however, could not migrate from one part of the United States to another; neither could they obtain
    employment as readily as white people, either upon or beyond the Indian reservations. They must remain in
    comparative idleness and accept the results of the drought—an insufficient supply of food. This created a feeling of
    discontent even among the loyal and well disposed and added to the feeling of hostility of the element opposed to
    every process of civilization.</p>

  <p>Reports forwarded by Brigadier-General Ruger, commanding Department of Dakota, contained the following:</p>

  <p>The commanding officer at Fort Yates, North Dakota, under date of December 7, 1890, at the time the Messiah
    delusion was approaching a climax, says, in reference to the disaffection of the Sioux Indians at Standing Rock
    agency, that it is due to the following causes:</p>

  <p>(1) Failure of the government to establish an equitable southern boundary of the Standing Rock agency reservation.</p>

  <p>(2) Failure of the government to expend a just proportion of the money received from the Chicago, Milwaukee and St.
    Paul railroad company, for right of way privileges, for the benefit of the Indians of said agency. Official notice
    was received October 18, 1881, by the Indian agent at the Standing Rock agency, that the said railroad company had
    paid the government under its agreement with the Sioux Indians, for right of way privileges, the sum of $13,911.
    What additional payments, if any, have been made by the said railroad company, and what payments have been made by
    the Dakota Central railroad company, the records of the agency do not show. In 1883, and again in 1885, the agent,
    upon complaints made by the Indians, wrote to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, making certain recommendations as
    regards the expenditure of the money received from the said railroad company, but was in each instance informed that
    until Congress took action with respect to the funds referred to nothing could be done. No portion of the money had
    been expended up to that time (December, 1890) for the benefit of the Indians of the agency, and frequent complaints
    had been made to the agent by the Indians because they had received no benefits from their concessions to the said
    railroad companies.</p>

  <p>(3) Failure of the government to issue the certificates of title to allotments, as required by article 6 of the
    treaty of 1868.</p>

  <p>(4) Failure of the government to provide the full allowance of seeds and agricultural implements to Indians engaged
    in farming, as required in article 8, treaty of 1868.</p>

  <p>(5) Failure of the government to issue to such Indians the full number of cows and oxen provided in article 10,
    treaty of 1876.</p>

  <p>(7) Failure of the government to issue to the Indians the full ration stipulated in article 5, treaty of 1876. (For
    the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1890, the following shortages in the rations were found to exist: 485,275 pounds
    of beef [gross], 761,212 pounds of corn, 11,937 pounds of coffee, 281,712 pounds of flour, 26,234 pounds of sugar,
    and 39,852 pounds of beans. Although the obligations of the government extend no further than furnishing so much of
    the ration prescribed in article 5 as may be necessary for the support of the Indians, it would seem that, owing to
    the almost total failure of crops upon the Standing Rock reservation for the past four years, and the absence of
    game, the necessity for the issue of the full ration to the Indians here was never greater than at the present
    time—December, 1890.)</p>

  <p>(8) Failure of the government to issue to the Indians the full amount of annuity supplies to which they were
    entitled under the provisions of article 10, treaty of 1868.</p>

  <p>(9) Failure of the government to have the clothing and other annuity supplies ready for issue on the first day of
    August of each year. Such supplies have not been ready for issue to the Indians, as a rule, until the winter season
    is well advanced. (After careful examination at this agency, the commanding officer is convinced that not more than
    two-thirds of the supplies provided in article 10 have been issued there, and the government has never complied with
    that provision of article 10 which requires the supplies enumerated in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of said article to be
    delivered on or before the first day of August of each year. Such supplies for the present fiscal year, beginning
    July 1, 1890, had not yet reached (December, 1890) the nearest railway station, about 60 miles distant, from which
    point they must, at this season of the year, be freighted to this agency in wagons. It is now certain that the
    winter will be well advanced before the Indians at this agency receive their annual allowance of clothing and other
    annuity supplies.)</p>

  <p>(10) Failure of the government to appropriate money for the payment of the Indians for the ponies taken from them,
    by the authority of the government, in 1876.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the commanding officer says: “It, however, appears from the foregoing, that the government has
    failed to fulfill its obligations, and in order to render the Indians law-abiding, peaceful, contented, and
    prosperous it is strongly recommended that the treaties be promptly and fully carried out, and that the promises
    made by the commission in 1889 be faithfully kept.”</p>

  <p>You may be assured of the following facts that can not be gainsaid:</p>

  <p>First. The forcing process of attempting to make large bodies of Indians self-sustaining when the government was
    cutting down their rations and their crops almost a failure, is one cause of the difficulty.</p>

  <p>Second. While the Indians were urged and almost forced to sign a treaty presented to them by the commission
    authorized by Congress, in which they gave up a valuable portion of their reservation which is now occupied by white
    people, the government has failed to fulfill its part of the compact, and instead of an increase or even a
    reasonable supply for their support, they have been compelled to live on half and two-thirds rations, and received
    nothing for the surrender of their lands, neither has the government given any positive assurance that they intend
    to do any differently with them in the future.</p>

  <p>Congress has been in session several weeks and could, if it were disposed, in a few hours confirm the treaties that
    its commissioners have made with these Indians and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_836">836</span> appropriate
    the necessary funds for its fulfillment, and thereby give an earnest of their good faith or intention to fulfill
    their part of the compact. Such action, in my judgment, is essential to restore confidence with the Indians and give
    peace and protection to the settlements. If this be done, and the President authorized to place the turbulent and
    dangerous tribes of Indians under the control of the military, Congress need not enter into details, but can safely
    trust the military authorities to subjugate and govern, and in the near future make self-sustaining, any or all of
    the Indian tribes of this country.</p>

    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><i>Commanding the Army, Washington, District of Columbia</i>:</span></div>

  <p>Replying to your long telegram, one point is of vital importance—the difficult Indian problem can not be solved
    permanently at this end of the line. It requires the fulfillment by Congress of the treaty obligations which the
    Indians were entreated and coerced into signing. They signed away a valuable portion of their reservation, and it is
    now occupied by white people, for which they have received nothing. They understood that ample provision would be
    made for their support; instead, their supplies have been reduced, and much of the time they have been living on
    half and two-thirds rations. Their crops, as well as the crops of the white people, for two years have been almost a
    total failure. The disaffection is widespread, especially among the Sioux, while the Cheyennes have been on the
    verge of starvation and were forced to commit depredations to sustain life. These facts are beyond question, and the
    evidence is positive and sustained by thousands of witnesses. Serious difficulty has been gathering for years.
    Congress has been in session several weeks and could in a single hour confirm the treaties and appropriate the
    necessary funds for their fulfillment, which their commissioners and the highest officials of the government have
    guaranteed to these people, and unless the officers of the army can give some positive assurance that the government
    intends to act in good faith with these people, the loyal element will be diminished and the hostile element
    increased. If the government will give some positive assurance that it will fulfill its part of the understanding
    with these 20,000 Sioux Indians, they can safely trust the military authorities to subjugate, control, and govern
    these turbulent people, and I hope that you will ask the Secretary of War and the Chief Executive to bring this
    matter directly to the attention of Congress.</p>

  <div class="center small">(<i>A. G. O. Doc. 6266—1891.</i>)</div>

  <p class="right"><span class="smcap">Fort Bennett, South Dakota</span>, <i>January 9, 1891</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="smcap">Assistant Adjutant-General</span>,<br>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Department of Dakota, Saint Paul, Minnesota</i>.</span></div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In compliance with instructions of the department commander—copy attached marked
    A—I have the honor to submit the following report as the result of my investigations into the matters referred to
    therein.</p>

  <p>I have been at this post continuously since August 6, 1887, and inspector of Indian supplies at the Cheyenne River
    Indian agency, located here, during that period, and am at the present time.</p>

  <p>The Indians of this agency have a standing list of grievances which they present at every opportunity, and talk
    about in council when they assemble at every monthly ration issue. The Indians most persistent in recounting and
    proclaiming their grievances are those least willing to help in bettering their condition, and who are opposed to
    any change or improvement of their old habits and customs, and oppose all progress. Of this class I cite Big Foot’s
    band of irreconcilables—who have now ceased to complain—and those in accord with them. Except in the matter of short
    rations, the story of their wrongs needs no attention. It commences with a recital of the wrong done them by the
    white race sharing the earth with them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_837">837</span></p>

  <p>The other class, comprising a large majority of Indians of the reservation, have accepted the situation forced upon
    them, and have been for years bravely struggling in the effort to reconcile themselves to the ways of civilization
    and moral progress, with a gratifying degree of success. It is this class whose complaints and grievances demand
    considerate attention. They complain in true Indian style that they only have kept faith in all treaties made with
    them, and that somehow the treaties when they appeared in print were not in many respects the treaties which they
    signed.</p>

  <p>They complain principally—</p>

  <p>(1) That the boundaries of the reservation in the treaty of 1877 are not what they agreed to and thought they were
    signing on the paper, and they especially emphasize the point that the line of the western boundary should be a
    <i>straight line</i> at the Black Hills, instead of as it appears on the maps.</p>

  <p>(2) That they have never received full recompense for the ponies taken from them in 1876.</p>

  <p>(3) That the game has been destroyed and driven out of the country by the white people.</p>

  <p>(4) That their children are taken from them to eastern schools and kept for years, instead of being educated among
    them.</p>

  <p>(5) That when these eastern graduates return to them with civilized habits, education, and trades, there is no
    provision made on the reservation for their employment and improvement to the benefit of themselves and their
    people.</p>

  <p>(6) That the agents and employees sent out to them have not all been “good men” and considerate of their (the
    Indians’) interests and welfare.</p>

  <p>(7) That the issue of their annuity goods is delayed so late in the winter as to cause them much suffering.</p>

  <p>(8) That they are expected to plow the land and raise grain when the climate will not permit them to reap a crop.
    They think cattle should be issued to them for breeding purposes instead of farming implements for useless labor.</p>

  <p>(9) That the rations issued to them are insufficient in quantity and frequently (beef and flour) very poor in
    quality.</p>

  <p>Complaints 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are all well founded and justified by the facts in each case, No. 9 especially
    so, and this through no fault or negligence of the agent. The agent makes his annual estimate for sustenance in kind
    for the number of people borne on his rolls, based on the stipulated ration in treaty of 1877. This estimate is
    modified or cut down in the Indian Commissioner’s office to meet the requirements of a limited or reduced
    Congressional appropriation, and when it returns to the agent’s hands approved, he finds that he has just so many
    pounds of beef and flour, etc, placed to his credit for the year, without regard to whether they constitute the full
    number of treaty rations or not. There is no allowance given him for loss by shrinkage, wastage, or other
    unavoidable loss, and with the very best efforts and care in the distribution throughout the year of this usually
    reduced allowance there can not be issued to each Indian his treaty ration nor enough to properly sustain life. As a
    general thing the Indians of this reservation have been compelled to purchase food according to their means, between
    ration issues. Those having no means of purchase have suffered.</p>

  <p>The half pound of flour called for by the treaty ration could not be issued in full, and the half pound of corn
    required has never been issued nor anything in lieu of it. In the item of beef but 1 pound was issued instead of the
    pound and a half called for in the treaty, and during the early spring months, when the cattle on the range are thin
    and poor, the pound of beef issued to the Indian is but a fraction of the pound issued to him on the agent’s
    returns, and, under the system of purchase in practice until the present fiscal year, must necessarily be so. The
    agent’s purchase of the beef supply on the hoof for the year, under contract, is closed in the month of November,
    from which time he has to herd them the balance of the year as best he can. He is responsible for the weight they
    show on the scales when <i>fat and in prime condition</i>, so that a steer weighing 1,200 pounds in the fall must
    represent 1,200 pounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_838">838</span> in April, while in fact it may be but
    skin, horns, and bones, and weigh scarcely 600 pounds, while he has done his best to care for them during the
    severity of a Dakota winter. The Indians do not understand why they should be made to suffer all this shrinkage and
    loss, and it is a useless and humiliating attempt to explain. The agent is not to blame. The department of Indian
    affairs can do only the best it can with a limited and tardy appropriation. The remedy in the matter of food supply
    seems to be: A sufficient and earlier appropriation of funds. All contracts for the beef supply should call for
    delivery when required by the agent. The agent should be allowed a percentage of wastage to cover unavoidable loss
    in issue by shrinkage and wastage. The government should bear this loss and not the Indians.</p>

  <p>Complaint 1: No remarks.</p>

  <p>Complaint 2: Is before Congress.</p>

  <p>Complaint 4: Should be remedied by adequate home schools.</p>

  <p>Complaint 5: Suggests its proper remedy.</p>

  <p>Complaint 6: No remarks.</p>

  <p>Complaint 7: Can be remedied only by earlier appropriations.</p>

  <p>Complaint 8: This reservation is not agricultural land. The climate makes it a grazing country. The Indians now can
    raise cattle successfully and care for them in winter. All attempts at general farming must result in failure on
    account of climatic conditions.</p>

  <p>In connection with complaint 9, I respectfully invite attention to tabular statement accompanying this report,
    marked B, showing rations as issued up to December 6 in present fiscal year and amount required to make the issues
    according to article 5, treaty of February 27, 1877, and special attention to columns 6 and 7 therein.</p>

  <p>Appended to this report, marked C, is an extract copy of treaties of 1877 and 1868.</p>

  <p>In submitting this report, I desire to commend the administration of the affairs of this agency, as it has appeared
    under my daily observation since August, 1887. So far as this reservation is concerned, the present unrest among the
    Indians is not attributable to any just cause of complaint against the former or present agent or employees; nor is
    it due entirely or largely to failure on the part of the government to fulfill treaty obligations.</p>

  <p>“I think the late Sioux commissioners (General Crook, Major Warner, and Governor Foster) had something to do with
    starting this trouble. I was speaker for the whole tribe. In a general council I signed the bill (the late Sioux
    bill) and 580 signed with me. The other members of my band drew out and it divided us, and ever since<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_840">840</span> these two parties have been divided. The nonprogressive started the
    ghost dance to draw from us. We were made many promises, but have never heard from them since. The Great Father says
    if we do what he directs it will be to our benefit; but instead of this they are every year cutting down our
    rations, and we do not get enough to keep us from suffering. General Crook talked nice to us; and after we signed
    the bill they took our land and cut down our allowance of food. The commission made us believe that we would get
    full sacks if we signed the bill, but instead of that our sacks are empty. We lost considerable property by being
    here with the commissioners last year, and have never got anything for it. Our chickens were all stolen, our cattle
    some of them were killed, our crops were entirely lost by us being absent here with the Sioux commission, and we
    have never been benefited one bit by the bill; and, in fact, we are worse off than we were before we signed the
    bill. We are told if we do as white men we will be better off, but we are getting worse off every year.”</p>

  <p>“The commissioners promised the Indians living on Black Pipe and Pass creeks that if they signed the bill they
    could remain where they were and draw their rations at this agency, showing them on the map the line, and our people
    want them here, but they have been ordered to move back to Rosebud agency. This is one of the broken promises. The
    commission promised to survey the boundary line, and appropriate $1,000 for the purpose, but it has not been done.
    When we were at Washington, the President, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Commissioner all promised us that
    we would get the million pounds of beef that were taken from us, and I heard the bill appropriating the money passed
    Congress, but we never got the beef. The Commissioner refused to give it to us. American Horse, Fast Thunder, and
    Spotted Horse were all promised a spring wagon each, but they have never heard anything of it. This is another
    broken promise.”</p>

  <p>In forwarding the report of the council, the agent says: “After American Horse was through talking, I asked the
    other men present if his statement voiced their sentiments and they all answered, Yes.”</p>

  <h4 id="Statement_of_Bishop_Hare">STATEMENT OF BISHOP HARE</h4>

  <p class="hang">[<i>Bishop W. H. Hare is the veteran Episcopal missionary bishop among the Sioux. The following extracts are from
    a communication by him to Secretary Noble, dated January 7, 1891. <a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a> Doc. 2440—1891.</i>]</p>

  <p>The evidence compels the conclusion that, among the Pine Ridge Indians at least, <i>hunger has been an important
    element</i> in the causes of <i>discontent</i> and <i>insubordination</i>. In the farming season of 1889 [July]
    the Indians were all called into the agency and kept there for a month by the Sioux commission. During their absence
    their cattle broke into their fields and trod down, or ate up, their crops. The Indians reaped practically nothing.
    In the year 1890, drought, the worst known for many years, afflicted the western part of South Dakota, and the
    Indian crops were a total failure. There is ample evidence that, during this period, the rations issued lasted, even
    when carefully used, for only two-thirds the time for which they were intended. To add to their distress, this
    period, 1889 and 1890, was marked by extraordinary misfortune. The measles prevailed with great virulence in 1889,
    the grippe in 1890. Whooping cough also attacked the children. The sick died from want. In this statement Inspector
    Gardiner, Dr McGillycuddy, late agent, Miss Elaine Goodale, who has been in the camps a good deal, the missionary
    force, and many others whose testimony is of the highest value because of their character and their knowledge of the
    situation, all agree....</p>

  <p>The time seemed now to have come to take a further step and divide the Great Sioux reservation up into separate
    reserves for each important tribe, and to open the surplus land to settlement. The needs of the white population,
    with their business and railroads, and the welfare of the Indians, seemed alike to demand this. Commissioners were
    therefore sent out to treat with the people for the accomplishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_841">
    841</span> of this end, and an agreement which, after much debate, had won general approval was committed to them
    for presentation to the Indians. The objections of the Indians to the bill, however, were many and they were
    ardently pressed. Some preferred their old life, the more earnestly because schools and churches were sapping and
    undermining it. Some wished delay. All complained that many of the engagements solemnly made with them in former
    years when they had surrendered valued rights had been broken, and here they were right. They suspected that present
    promises of pay for their lands would prove only old ones in a new shape (when milch cows were promised, cows having
    been promised in previous agreements, the Indians exclaimed, “There’s that same old cow”), and demanded that no
    further surrender should be expected until former promises had been fulfilled. They were assured that a new era had
    dawned, and that all past promises would be kept. So we all thought. The benefits of the proposed agreement were set
    before them, and verbal promises, over and above the stipulations of the bill, were made, that special requests of
    the Indians would be met. The Indians have no competent representative body. The commissioners had to treat at each
    agency with a crowd, a crowd composed of full-bloods, half-breeds, and squaw men, a crowd among whom all sorts of
    sinister influences and brute force were at work. Commissioners with such a business in hand have the devil to
    fight, and can fight him, so it often seems, only with fire, and many friends of the Indians think that in this case
    the commission, convinced that the acceptance of the bill was essential, carried persuasion to the verge of
    intimidation. I do not blame them if they sometimes did. The wit and patience of an angel would fail often in such a
    task.</p>

  <p>But the requisite number, three-fourths of the Indians, signed the bill, and expectation of rich and prompt rewards
    ran high. The Indians understand little of the complex forms and delays of our government. Six months passed, and
    nothing came. Three months more, and nothing came. A bill was drawn up in the Senate under General Crook’s eye and
    passed, providing for the fulfillment of the promises of the commission, but it was pigeon-holed in the House. But
    in the midst of the winter’s pinching cold the Indians learned that the transaction had been declared complete and
    half of their land proclaimed as thrown open to the whites. Surveys were not promptly made; perhaps they could not
    be, and no one knew what land was theirs and what was not. The very earth seemed sliding from beneath their feet.
    Other misfortunes seemed to be crowding on them. On some reserves their rations were being reduced, and lasted, even
    when carefully husbanded, but one-half the period for which they were issued. (The amount of beef <i>bought</i> for
    the Indians is not a fair criterion of the amount he <i>receives</i>. A steer will lose 200 pounds or more of its
    flesh during the course of the winter.) In the summer of 1889 all the people on the Pine Ridge reserve, men, women,
    and children, were called in from their farms to the agency to treat with the commissioners and were kept there a
    whole month, and, on returning to their homes, found that their cattle had broken into their fields and trampled
    down or eaten up all their crops. This was true in a degree elsewhere. In 1890 the crops, which promised splendidly
    early in July, failed entirely later, because of a severe drought. The people were often hungry, and, the physicians
    in many cases said, died when taken sick, not so much from disease as for want of food. (This is doubtless true of
    all the poor—the poor in our cities and the poor settlers in the west.)</p>

  <p>No doubt the people could have saved themselves from suffering if industry, economy, and thrift had abounded; but
    these are just the virtues which a people merging from barbarism lack. The measles prevailed in 1889 and were
    exceedingly fatal. Next year the grippe swept over the people with appalling results. Whooping cough followed among
    the children. Sullenness and gloom began to gather, especially among the heathen and wilder Indians. A witness of
    high character told me that a marked discontent amounting almost to despair prevailed in many quarters. The people
    said their children were all dying from diseases brought by the whites, their race was perishing from the face of
    the earth, and they might as well be killed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_842">842</span> at once. Old chiefs
    and medicine men were losing their power. Withal new ways were prevailing more and more which did not suit the older
    people. The old ways which they loved were passing away. In a word, all things were against them, and to add to the
    calamity, many Indians, especially the wilder element, had nothing to do but to brood over their misfortunes. While
    in this unhappy state, the story of a messiah coming, with its ghost dance and strange hallucinations, spread among
    the heathen part of the people....</p>

  <p>But these things we do want. A profound conviction in the mind not only of a few, but of the <i>people</i>, that
    the Indian problem is worth attending to. Next, that the officials placed in charge of the difficult Indian problem
    should be protected from the importunity of hungry politicians, and that the employees in the Indian country,
    agents, teachers, farmers, carpenters, should not be changed with every shuffling of the political cards. The abuse
    here has been shameful. Next, that Congress, especially the House of Representatives, shall consider itself bound in
    honor to make provision for the fulfillment of promises made to the Indians by commissioners duly appointed and sent
    to the Indians by another branch of the government. The evils which have arisen from a violation of this comity have
    been most serious. Next, that testimony regarding Indian affairs should not be swallowed until careful inquiry has
    been made as to the disinterestedness of the witness. An honest man out here burns with indignation when he reads in
    the papers that so and so, represented as being fully informed on the whole question, affirms that Indians have no
    grievances and ought to receive no quarter, when he knows that the lots which the witness owns in a town near the
    Indian country would no longer be a drug in the market if Indians could be gotten out of the way. Next, let it be
    remembered that the crisis has lifted evils in the Indian country up to the light, and left the good things in the
    shade. But the good things are real and have shown their vigor under trial. There is no reason for losing faith or
    courage. Let all kind and honest men unite with the higher officials of the government, all of whom, I believe, mean
    well, in a spirit of forbearance toward each other, of willingness to learn, and of mutual helpfulness, to
    accomplish the results which they all desire.</p>

      THE SIOUX OUTBREAK—SITTING BULL AND WOUNDED KNEE</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subhead">
    <p>We were made many promises, but have never heard from them since.—<i>American Horse.</i></p>

    <p>Congress has been in session several weeks and could, if it were disposed, in a few hours confirm the treaty that
      its commissioners have made with these Indians, and appropriate the necessary funds for their fulfillment, and
      thereby give an earnest of good faith or intention to fulfill their part of the compact. Such action in my
      judgment is essential to restore confidence with the Indians and give peace and protection to the
      settlements.—<i>General Miles.</i></p>

    <p>Approximate cost of outbreak in one month: Forty-nine whites and others on the government side, and three hundred
      Indians, killed; $1,200,000 expense to government and individuals.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Short Bull and the other Sioux delegates who had gone to see the messiah in the fall of 1889 returned in March,
    1890. Short Bull, on Rosebud reservation, at once began to preach to his people the doctrine and advent of the
    messiah, but desisted on being warned to stop by Agent Wright. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 29.</i>) The strange hope had taken hold
    of the Indians however, and the infection rapidly, although quietly, spread among all the wilder portion of the
    tribe. The first warning of trouble ahead came in the shape of a letter addressed to Secretary Noble by Charles L.
    Hyde, a citizen of Pierre, South Dakota, under date of May 29, 1890, in which he stated that he had trustworthy
    information that the Sioux, or a part of them, were secretly planning an outbreak in the near future. His informant
    appears to have been a young half-blood from Pine Ridge, who was at that time attending school in Pierre, and was in
    correspondence with his Indian relatives at home. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 20.</i>) The letter was referred to the Commissioner of
    Indian Affairs, who forwarded a copy of it to the agents of the several western Sioux reservations, with a request
    for further information. They promptly and unanimously replied that there was no ground for apprehension, that the
    Indians were peaceably disposed, and that there was no undue excitement beyond that occasioned by the rumors of a
    messiah in the west. This excitement they thought would continue to increase as the predicted time drew near, and
    would die a natural death when the prophecy failed of its fulfillment.</p>

  <p>All the agents are positive in the opinion that at this time, about the middle of June, 1890, the Indians had no
    hostile intentions. McLaughlin, the veteran agent of Standing Rock, who probably knew the Sioux better than any
    other white man having official relations with them, states that among his people there was nothing in word or
    action to justify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_844">844</span> such a suspicion, and that he did not believe
    such an imprudent step was seriously contemplated by any of the tribe, and concludes by saying that he has every
    confidence in the good intentions of the Sioux as a people, that they would not be the aggressors in any hostile
    act, and that if justice were only done them no uneasiness need be entertained. He complains, however, of the evil
    influence exercised by Sitting Bull and a few other malcontents attached to his agency and advises their removal
    from among the Indians. Wright, at Rosebud, also advised the removal of Crow Dog and some other mischief-makers.
    These men had led the opposition to the late treaty and to every advance of civilization, by which they felt their
    former influence undermined, and between them and the progressive party there was uncompromising hostility. (<i>G.
    D., 21.</i>) Although the trouble did come six months later, it is sufficiently evident that at this time there
    was no outbreak intended. Certain it is that the Sioux as a tribe—25,000 strong—did not engage in the outbreak, and
    in view of all the circumstances it will hardly be claimed that they were deliberate aggressors.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 72</span>—A Sioux warrior—Weasel Bear.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The first mutterings of dissatisfaction came from Pine Ridge. This is the largest of the Sioux agencies, having
    6,000 of the wildest and most warlike of the tribe, largely under the influence of the celebrated<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_845">845</span> chief Red Cloud, the twin spirit of Sitting Bull in wily disposition
    and hatred of the white man. It is the most remote from the white settlements along Missouri river, and joins
    Rosebud reservation, with 4,000 more Sioux of about the same condition and temper, thus making a compact body of
    10,000 of the most warlike Indians of the plains. Above all other reservations in the United States this was the
    very one where there was most urgent and obvious necessity for efficient and vigorous administration and for prompt
    and honest fulfillment of pledges.</p>

  <p>From 1879 to 1886 this agency was in charge of Dr V. T. McGillycuddy, a man of unflinching courage, determined
    will, and splendid executive ability. Taking charge of these Indians when they had come in fresh from the warpath,
    he managed them, as he himself says, for seven years without the presence of a soldier on the reservation, and with
    none nearer than 60 miles. Relying on the Indians themselves, he introduced the principle of home rule by organizing
    a force of 50 Indian police, drilled in regular cavalry and infantry tactics. With these he was able to thwart all
    the mischievous schemes of Red Cloud, maintain authority, and start the Indians well on the road to civilization.</p>

  <p>Then came a political change of administration, with a resulting train of changes all through the service. Out of
    58 Indian agents more than 50 were removed and new men appointed. Some of these appointments were for the better,
    but the general result was bad, owing mainly to the inexperience of the new officials. In the meantime commissioners
    were negotiating with the Sioux for a further cession of lands, which was finally effected in spite of the
    opposition of a large part of the tribe, especially of those under the influence of Red Cloud and Sitting Bull at
    Pine Ridge and Standing Rock. Then rations were reduced and the Indians began to suffer and, consequently, to be
    restless, their unrest being intensified but not caused by the rumors of a messiah soon to appear to restore the
    former conditions. According to the official statement of General Brooke, the beef issue at Pine Ridge was reduced
    from 8,125,000 pounds in 1886 to 4,000,000 pounds in 1889, a reduction of more than one-half in three years.
    (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 5.</i>) In April, 1890, Gallagher, the agent then in charge, informed the Department that the monthly beef
    issue was only 205,000 pounds, whereas the treaty called for 470,400. He was informed that it was better to issue
    half rations all the time than to issue three-fourths or full rations for two months and none for the rest of the
    year. From other sources also the warning now came to the Department that the Sioux of Pine Ridge were becoming
    restless from hunger. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 22.</i>) Repeated representations failed to bring more beef, and at last in the
    summer of 1890 the Indians at Pine Ridge made the first actual demonstration by refusing to accept the deficient
    issue and making threats against the agent. They were finally persuaded to take the beef, but Agent Gallagher,
    finding that the dissatisfaction was growing and apparently without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_846">
    846</span> remedy, resigned, and his successor took charge in the beginning of October, 1890.</p>

  <figure class="illowp70" id="fig_73">
    <img class="figbox" src="images/fig73.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 73</span>—Red Cloud.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>By this time the Ghost dance was in full progress among the western Sioux and was rapidly spreading throughout the
    tribe. The principal dance ground on Pine Ridge reservation was at No Water’s camp on White Clay creek, about 20
    miles from the agency. At a great Ghost dance held here about the middle of June the ghost shirts were worn probably
    for the first time. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 30.</i>) In August about 2,000 Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_847">
    847</span> had assembled for a dance at the same rendezvous, when Agent Gallagher sent out several police with
    orders to the dancers to quit and go home. They refused to do so, and the agent himself went out with more police to
    enforce the order. On repeating his demand a number of the warriors leveled their guns toward him and the police,
    and told him that they were ready to defend their religion with their lives. Under the circumstances the agent,
    although known to be a brave man, deemed it best to withdraw and the dance went on. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 31; <a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 23.</i>)</p>

  <p>On Rosebud reservation, which adjoins Pine Ridge on the east and is occupied by the turbulent and warlike Brulés,
    the warning given to Short Bull had such an effect that there was no open manifestation until September, when the
    Ghost dance was inaugurated at the various camps under the leadership of Short Bull the medicine-man, Crow Dog, and
    Two Strike. Agent Wright, then in charge, went out to the Indians and told them the dance must be stopped, which was
    accordingly done. He expressly states that no violence was contemplated by the Indians, and that no arms were
    carried in the dance, but that he forbade it on account of its physical and mental effect on the participants and
    its tendency to draw them from their homes. In some way a rumor got among the Indians at this time that troops had
    arrived on the reservation to attack them, and in an incredibly short time every Indian had left the neighborhood of
    the agency and was making preparations to meet the enemy. It was with some difficulty that Agent Wright was able to
    convince them that the report was false and persuade them to return to their homes. Soon afterward circumstances
    obliged him to be temporarily absent, leaving affairs in the meantime in charge of a special agent. The Indians took
    advantage of his absence to renew the Ghost dance and soon defied control. The agent states, however, that no
    Indians left the agency until the arrival of the troops, when the leaders immediately departed for Pine Ridge,
    together with 1,800 of their followers. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 24; <a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 32.</i>)</p>

  <p>On October 9 Kicking Bear of Cheyenne River agency, the chief high priest of the Ghost dance among the Sioux, went
    to Standing Rock by invitation of Sitting Bull and inaugurated the dance on that reservation at Sitting Bull’s camp
    on Grand river. The dance had begun on Cheyenne river about the middle of September, chiefly at the camps of Hump
    and Big Foot. On learning of Kicking Bear’s arrival, Agent McLaughlin sent a force of police, including two
    officers, to arrest him and put him off the reservation, but they returned without executing the order, both
    officers being in a dazed condition and fearing the power of Kicking Bear’s “medicine.” Sitting Bull, however, had
    promised that his visitors would go back to their own reservation, which they did a day or two later, but he
    declared his intention to continue the dance, as they had received a direct message from the spirit world through
    Kicking Bear that they must do so to live. He promised that he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_848">
    848</span> suspend the dance until he could come and talk the matter over with the agent, but this promise he
    failed to keep. Considering Sitting Bull the leader and instigator of the excitement on the reservation, McLaughlin
    again advised his removal, and that of several other mischief makers, and their confinement in some military prison
    at a distance. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 25.</i>)</p>

  <p>The two centers of excitement were now at Standing Rock reservation, where Sitting Bull was the open and declared
    leader, and at Pine Ridge, where Red Cloud was a firm believer in the new doctrine, although perhaps not an
    instigator of direct opposition to authority. At Rosebud the movement had been smothered for the time by the prompt
    action of Agent Wright, as already described. At the first-named reservation McLaughlin met the emergency with
    bravery and ability reinforced by twenty years of experience in dealing with Indians, and, while recommending the
    removal of Sitting Bull, expressed confidence in his own ability to allay the excitement and suppress the dance. At
    Pine Ridge, however, where the crisis demanded a man of most positive character—somebody of the McGillycuddy
    stamp—Gallagher had resigned and had been succeeded in October by D. F. Royer, a person described as “destitute of
    any of those qualities by which he could justly lay claim to the position—experience, force of character, courage,
    and sound judgment.” (<i><a href="#Welsh">Welsh</a>, 2.</i>) This appears in every letter and telegram sent out by him during his short
    incumbency, and is sufficiently evidenced in the name by which the Sioux soon came to know him,
    Lakota-Kokipa-Koshkala, “Young-man-afraid-of-Indians.” Before he had been in charge a week, he had so far lost
    control of his Indians as to allow a half dozen of them to release and carry off a prisoner named Little, whom the
    police had arrested and brought to the agency. On October 12 he reported that more than half of his 6,000 Indians
    were dancing, and that they were entirely beyond the control of the police, and suggested that it would be necessary
    to call out the military. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 26.</i>)</p>

  <p>About the same time Agent Palmer at Cheyenne River reported to the Department that Big Foot’s band (afterward
    engaged at Wounded Knee) was very much excited over the coming of the messiah, and could not be kept by the police
    from dancing. In reply, both agents were instructed to use every prudent measure to stop the dance and were told
    that military assistance would be furnished if immediate need should arise. (<i><a href="#LB">L. B.</a>, 1.</i>) Instructions were
    also sent to agents in Nevada to warn the leaders of the dance in that quarter to desist. A few days later the agent
    at Cheyenne River had a talk with the dancers, and so far convinced them of the falsity of their hopes that he was
    able to report that the excitement was dying out, but recommended the removal of Hump, as a leader of the
    disaffection. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 27.</i>)</p>

  <p>By the advice of the Department, Royer had consulted General Miles, at that time passing on his way to the west, as
    to the necessity for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_849">849</span> troops, and, after hearing a full statement,
    the general expressed the opinion that the excitement would die out of itself. The next day the general had a talk
    with the Indians, who informed him that they intended to continue the dance. He gave them some good advice and told
    them that they must stop. Had the matter rested here until the words of the commanding officer could have been
    deliberated in their minds—for the mental process of an Indian can not well be hurried—all might have been well.
    Unfortunately, however, the agent, now thoroughly frightened, wrote a long letter to the Department on October 30,
    stating that the only remedy for the matter was the use of military, and that about 600 or 700 troops would be
    necessary. On November 11 he telegraphed for permission to come to Washington to “explain,” and was refused. Then
    came other telegraphic requests, at the rate of one every day, for the same permission, all of which were refused,
    with pointed intimation that the interests of the service required that the agent should remain at his post of duty.
    Finally the matter was reported by the Indian Office to the War Department, and on November 15 Royer was instructed
    to report the condition of affairs to the commander of the nearest military post, Port Robinson, Nebraska. On the
    same day he had telegraphed that the Indians were wild and crazy and that at least a thousand soldiers were needed.
    The agent at Rosebud also now reported that his Indians were beyond control by the police. Special agents were sent
    to both agencies and confirmed the reports as to the alarming condition of affairs. The agent at Crow Creek and
    Lower Brulé agency reported at the same time that his Indians were under good control and that the police were
    sufficient for all purposes. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 28; <a href="#LB">L. B.</a>, 2.</i>)</p>

  <p>On the last day of October, Short Bull, one of those who had been to see the messiah, made an address to a large
    gathering of Indians near Pine Ridge, in which he said that as the whites were interfering so much in the religious
    affairs of the Indians he would advance the time for the great change and make it nearer, even within the next
    month. He urged them all to gather in one place and prepare for the coming messiah, and told them they must dance
    even though troops should surround them, as the guns of the soldiers would be rendered harmless and the white race
    itself would soon be annihilated. (See his speech, <a href="#Page_788">page 788</a>.)</p>

  <p>Soon afterward, McLaughlin personally visited Sitting Bull at his camp on Grand river and attempted to reason with
    the Indians on the absurdity of their belief. In reply, Sitting Bull proposed that they should both go with
    competent attendants to the country of the messiah and see and question him for themselves, and rest the truth or
    falsity of the new doctrine on the result. The proposition was not accepted. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 29.</i>) There can be no
    question that the leaders of the Ghost dance among the Sioux were fully as much deceived as their followers.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_850">850</span></p>

  <p>As the local agents had declared the situation beyond their control, the War Department was at last called on and
    responded. On November 13 the President had directed the Secretary of War to assume a military responsibility to
    prevent an outbreak (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 30</i>), and on November 17 troops, under command of General John R. Brooke, were
    ordered to the front. The general plan of the campaign was under the direction of General Nelson A. Miles, in
    command of the military department of the Missouri. On November 19 the first troops arrived at Pine Ridge from Fort
    Robinson, Nebraska, and were speedily reinforced by others. Within a few days there were at Pine Ridge agency, under
    immediate command of General Brooke, eight troops of the Seventh cavalry, under Colonel Forsyth; a battalion of the
    Ninth cavalry (colored), under Major Henry; a battalion of the Fifth artillery, under Captain Capron, and a company
    of the Eighth infantry and eight companies of the Second infantry, under Colonel Wheaton. At Rosebud were two troops
    of the Ninth cavalry, with portions of the Eighth and Twenty-first infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Poland.
    Between Rosebud and Pine Ridge were stationed seven companies of the First infantry, under Colonel Shafter. West and
    north of Pine Ridge were stationed portions of the First, Second, and Ninth cavalry, under command of Colonel
    Tilford and Lieutenant-Colonel Sanford. Farther west, at Buffalo Gap, on the railroad, were stationed three troops
    from the Fifth and Eighth cavalry, under Captain Wells. Farther north on the railroad, at Rapid City, was Colonel
    Carr with six troops of the Sixth cavalry. Along the south fork of Cheyenne river Lieutenant-Colonel Offley took
    position with seven companies of the Seventeenth infantry, and east of him was stationed Lieutenant-Colonel Sumner
    with three troops of the Eighth cavalry, two companies of the Third infantry, and Lieutenant Robinson’s company of
    Crow Indian scouts. Small garrisons were also stationed at Forts Meade, Bennett, and Sully. Most of the force was
    placed in position between the Indians now gathering in the Bad Lands, under Short Bull and Kicking Bear, and the
    scattered settlements nearest them. Seven companies of the Seventh infantry, under Colonel Merriam, were also placed
    along Cheyenne river to restrain the Indians of Cheyenne River and Standing Rock reservations. In a short time there
    were nearly 3,000 troops in the field in the Sioux country. General Miles established his headquarters at Rapid
    City, South Dakota, close to the center of disturbance. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 6.</i>) On December 1 the Secretary of the Interior
    directed that the agents be instructed to obey and cooperate with the military officers in all matters looking to
    the suppression of an outbreak. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 31.</i>)</p>

  <p>Upon the first appearance of the troops a large number of Indians of Rosebud and Pine Ridge, led by Short Bull,
    Kicking Bear, and others, left their homes and fled to the rough broken country known as the Bad Lands, northwest of
    White river in South Dakota, on the edge <span class="pagenum" id="Page_851">851</span>of Pine Ridge
    reservation and about 50 miles northwest of the agency. In their flight they destroyed the houses and other property
    of the friendly Indians in their path and compelled many to go with them. They succeeded also in capturing a large
    portion of the agency beef herd. Others rapidly joined them until soon a formidable body of 3,000 Indians had
    gathered in the Bad Lands, where, protected by the natural fastnesses and difficulties of the country, their future
    intentions became a matter of anxious concern to the settlers and the authorities.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 74</span>—Short Bull.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>From the concurrent testimony of all the witnesses, including Indian Commissioner Morgan and the Indians
    themselves, this flight to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_852">852</span> Bad Lands was not properly a
    hostile movement, but was a stampede caused by panic at the appearance of the troops. In his official report
    Commissioner Morgan says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When the troops reached Rosebud, about 1,800 Indians—men, women, and children—stampeded toward Pine Ridge and the
      Bad Lands, destroying their own property before leaving and that of others en route.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After the death of Sitting Bull he says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Groups of Indians from the different reservations had commenced concentrating in the Bad Lands, upon or in the
      vicinity of the Pine Ridge reservation. Killing of cattle and destruction of other property by these Indians,
      almost entirely within the limits of Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations, occurred, but no signal fires were
      built, no warlike demonstrations were made, no violence was done to any white settlers, nor was there any cohesion
      or organization among the Indians themselves. Many of them were friendly Indians who had never participated in the
      ghost dance, but had fled thither from fear of soldiers, in consequence of the Sitting Bull affair or through the
      overpersuasion of friends. The military gradually began to close in around them and they offered no resistance,
      and a speedy and quiet capitulation of all was confidently expected. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 33.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Sioux nation numbers over 25,000, with between 6,000 and 7,000 warriors. Hardly more than 700 warriors were
    concerned altogether, including those of Big Foot’s band and those who fled to the Bad Lands. None of the Christian
    Indians took any part in the disturbance.</p>

  <p>While it is certain that the movement toward the Bad Lands with the subsequent events were the result of panic at
    the appearance of the troops, it is equally true that the troops were sent only on the request of the civilian
    authorities. On this point General Miles says: “Not until the civil agents had lost control of the Indians and
    declared themselves powerless to preserve peace, and the Indians were in armed hostility and defiance of the civil
    authorities, was a single soldier moved from his garrison to suppress the general revolt.” (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 7.</i>)
    Throughout the whole trouble McGillycuddy at Standing Rock consistently declared his ability to control his Indians
    without the presence of troops.</p>

  <p>In accord with instructions from the Indian Office, the several agents in charge among the Sioux had forwarded
    lists of disturbers whom it would be advisable to arrest and remove from among the Indians, using the military for
    the purpose if necessary. The agents at the other reservations sent in all together the names of about fifteen
    subjects for removal, while Royer, at Pine Ridge, forwarded as a “conservative estimate” the names of sixty-four.
    Short Bull and Kicking Bear being in the Bad Lands, and Red Cloud being now an old man and too politic to make much
    open demonstration, the head and front of the offenders was Sitting Bull, the irreconcilable; but McLaughlin, within
    whose jurisdiction he was, in a letter of November 22, advised that the arrest be not attempted until later in the
    season, as at the date of writing the weather was warm and pleasant—in other words, favorable to the Indians in case
    they should make opposition. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 32.</i>) The worst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_853">853</span>
    element had withdrawn to the Bad Lands, where they were making no hostile demonstrations, but were apparently badly
    frightened and awaiting developments to know whether to come in and surrender or to continue to retreat. The dance
    had generally been discontinued on the reservations, excepting at Sitting Bull’s camp on Grand river and Big Foot’s
    camp on Cheyenne river. The presence of troops had stopped the dances near the agencies, and the Secretary of the
    Interior, in order to allay the dissatisfaction, had ordered that the full rations due under the treaty should be
    issued at all the Sioux agencies, which at the same time were placed under the control of the military.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_854">854</span>(<i>G. D., 33; <a href="#LB">L. B.</a>, 3.</i>) Such were the conditions on the opening of
    December, 1890. Everything seemed to be quieting down, and it was now deemed a favorable time to forestall future
    disturbance by removing the ringleaders.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Agent McLaughlin at Standing Rock had notified the Department some weeks before that it would be necessary to
    remove Sitting Bull and several others at no distant day to put an end to their harmful influence among the Sioux,
    but stated also that the matter should not be precipitated, and that when the proper time came he could accomplish
    the undertaking with his Indian police without the aid of troops. As soon as the War Department assumed control of
    the Sioux agencies, it was determined to make an attempt to secure Sitting Bull by military power. Accordingly,
    orders were given to the noted scout, William F. Cody, better known as Buffalo Bill, who was well acquainted with
    Sitting Bull and was believed to have influence with him, to proceed to Standing Rock agency to induce him to come
    in, with authority to make such terms as might seem necessary, and, if unsuccessful, to arrest him and remove him
    from his camp to the nearest post, Fort Yates. Cody arrived at Fort Yates on November 28, and was about to undertake
    the arrest, when his orders were countermanded at the urgent remonstrance of Agent McLaughlin, who represented that
    such a step at that particular time was unwise, as military interference was liable to provoke a conflict, in which
    the Indians would have the advantage, as the warm weather was in their favor. He insisted that there was no
    immediate danger from the dancing, and that at the proper time—when the weather grew colder—he could take care of
    Sitting Bull and the other disturbers whose removal he advised with the aid of the Indian police, whom, in all his
    years of service, he had always found equal to the emergency. The attempt was accordingly postponed. In the meantime
    Sitting Bull had promised to come into the agency to talk over the situation with the agent, but failed to keep his
    engagement. A close watch was kept over his movements and the agent was instructed to make no arrests except by
    authority from the military or the Secretary of the Interior. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 34.</i>)</p>

  <p>There is no question that Sitting Bull was plotting mischief. His previous record was one of irreconcilable
    hostility to the government, and in every disturbance on the reservation his camp had been the center of ferment. It
    was at his camp and on his invitation that Kicking Bear had organized the first Ghost dance on the reservation, and
    the dance had been kept up by Sitting Bull ever since in spite of the repeated remonstrance of the agent. At the
    same time the turbulent followers of the medicine-man took every opportunity to insult and annoy the peaceable and
    progressive Indians who refused to join them until these latter were forced to make complaint to the agent. In
    October, while the dance was being organized at his camp, Sitting Bull had deliberately broken the “pipe of peace”
    which he had kept <span class="pagenum" id="Page_855">855</span>in his house since his surrender in 1881, and
    when asked why he had broken it, replied that he wanted to die and wanted to fight. From that time he discontinued
    his regular visits to the agency. It became known that he contemplated leaving the reservation to visit the other
    leaders of dissatisfaction at the southern Sioux agencies, and to frustrate such an attempt the agent had gradually
    increased the number of police in the neighborhood of his camp, and had arranged for speedy information and prompt
    action in case of any sudden move on his part. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 35.</i>)</p>

  <p>Foreseeing from the active movements of the military that the arrest of Sitting Bull was liable to be ordered at
    any moment, and fearing that such action might come at an inopportune time, and thus result in trouble, McLaughlin
    made arrangements to have him and several other disturbers arrested by the Indian police on the night of December 6,
    the weather and other things being then, in his opinion, most favorable for the attempt. On telegraphing to the
    Indian department, however, for authority, he was directed to make no arrests excepting upon order from the military
    authorities or the Secretary of the Interior. In reply to a telegram from General Ruger, McLaughlin stated that
    there was no immediate need of haste, and that postponement was preferable, as the winter weather was cooling the
    ardor of the dancers.</p>

  <p>On December 12 the military order came for the arrest of Sitting Bull. Colonel Drum, in command at Fort Yates, was
    directed to make it his personal duty to secure him and to call on the agent for assistance and cooperation in the
    matter. On consultation between the commandant and the agent, who were in full accord, it was decided to make the
    arrest on the 20th, when most of the Indians would be down at the agency for rations, and there would consequently
    be less danger of a conflict at the camp. On the 14th, however, late Sunday afternoon, a courier came from Grand
    river with a message from Mr Carignan, the teacher of the Indian school, stating, on information given by the
    police, that an invitation had just come from Pine Ridge to Sitting Bull asking him to go there, as God was about to
    appear. Sitting Bull was determined to go, and sent a request to the agent for permission, but in the meantime had
    completed his preparations to go anyhow in case permission was refused. With this intention it was further stated
    that he had his horses already selected for a long and hard ride, and the police urgently asked to be allowed to
    arrest him at once, as it would be a difficult matter to overtake him after he had once started.</p>

  <p>It was necessary to act immediately, and arrangements were made between Colonel Drum and Agent McLaughlin to
    attempt the arrest at daylight the next morning, December 15. The arrest was to be made by the Indian police,
    assisted, if necessary, by a detachment of troops, who were to follow within supporting distance. There were already
    twenty-eight police under command of Lieutenant Bull Head in the immediate vicinity of Sitting Bull’s camp on Grand
    river, about 40<span class="pagenum" id="Page_856">856</span> miles southwest of the agency and Fort Yates, and
    couriers were at once dispatched to these and to others in that direction to concentrate at Sitting Bull’s house,
    ready to make the arrest in the morning. It was then sundown, but with loyal promptness the police mounted their
    ponies and by riding all night from one station to another assembled a force of 43 trained and determined Indian
    police, including four volunteers, at the rendezvous on Grand river before daylight. In performing this courier
    service Sergeant Red Tomahawk covered the distance of 40 miles between the agency and the camp, over an unfamiliar
    road, in four hours and a quarter; and another, Hawk Man, made 100 miles, by a roundabout way, in twenty-two hours.
    In the meantime two troops of the Eighth cavalry, numbering 100 men, under command of Captain E. G. Fechét, and
    having with them a Hotchkiss gun, left Fort Yates at midnight, guided by Louis Primeau, and by a rapid night march
    arrived within supporting distance near Sitting Bull’s camp just before daybreak. It was afterward learned that
    Sitting Bull, in anticipation of such action, had had a strong guard about his house for his protection for several
    nights previous, but on this particular night the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_857">857</span> Indians had
    been dancing until nearly morning, and the house was consequently left unguarded.</p>

    <img class="figbox" src="images/fig76.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 76</span>—Red Tomahawk.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>At daybreak on Monday morning, December 15, 1890, the police and volunteers, 43 in number, under command of
    Lieutenant Bull Head, a cool and reliable man, surrounded Sitting Bull’s house. He had two log cabins, a few rods
    apart, and to make sure of their man, eight of the police entered one house and ten went into the other, while the
    rest remained on guard outside. They found him asleep on the floor in the larger house. He was aroused and told that
    he was a prisoner and must go to the agency. He made no objection, but said “All right; I will dress and go with
    you.” He then sent one of his wives to the other house for some clothes he desired to wear, and asked to have his
    favorite horse saddled for him to ride, which was done by one of the police. On looking about the room two rifles
    and several knives were found and taken by the police. While dressing, he apparently changed his mind and began
    abusing the police for disturbing him, to which they made no reply. While this was going on inside, his followers,
    to the number of perhaps 150, were congregating about the house outside and by the time he was dressed an excited
    crowd of Indians had the police entirely surrounded and were pressing them to the wall. On being brought out,
    Sitting Bull became greatly excited and refused to go, and called on his followers to rescue him. Lieutenant Bull
    Head and Sergeant Shave Head were standing on each side of him, with Second Sergeant Red Tomahawk guarding behind,
    while the rest of the police were trying to clear the way in front, when one of Sitting Bull’s followers,
    Catch-the-Bear, fired and shot Lieutenant Bull Head in the side. Bull Head at once turned and sent a bullet into the
    body of Sitting Bull, who was also shot through the head at the same moment by Red Tomahawk. Sergeant Shave Head was
    shot by another of the crowd, and fell to the ground with Bull Head and Sitting Bull. Catch-the-Bear, who fired the
    first shot, was immediately shot and killed by Alone Man, one of the police, and it became a desperate hand-to-hand
    fight of less than 43 men against more than a hundred. The trained police soon drove their assailants into the
    timber near by, and then returned and carried their dead and wounded into the house and held it for about two hours,
    until the arrival of the troops under Captain Fechét, about half past seven. The troops had been notified of the
    perilous situation of the police by Hawk Man, who had volunteered to carry the information from Sitting Bull’s camp.
    He succeeded in getting away, assisted by Red Tomahawk, although so closely pursued that several bullets passed
    through his clothing. In spite of the efforts of the hostiles, the police also held possession of the corral, which
    Sitting Bull had filled with horses in anticipation of his flight. When the cavalry came in sight over a hill, about
    1,500 yards distant from the camp, the police at the corral raised a white flag to show where they were, but the
    troops, mistaking them for hostiles, fired two shells at them from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_858">
    858</span> the Hotchkiss, when Sergeant Red Tomahawk, who had taken command after the wounding of his superior
    officers, paraded his men in line and then rode out alone with a white flag to meet the troops. On the approach of
    the soldiers Sitting Bull’s warriors fled up Grand river a short distance and then turned south across the prairie
    toward Cherry creek and Cheyenne river. Not wishing to create such a panic among them as to drive them into the
    hostile camp in the Bad Lands, Captain Fechét pursued them only a short distance and then left them to be handled by
    the other detachments in that direction. Their wives and families, their property and their dead, were left behind
    in the flight. As soon as possible Captain Fechét also sent word to them by some Indian women to return to their
    homes and they would not be molested. To further reassure them, the troops at once began their march back to the
    post. As a result of this sensible policy, very few of the Sitting Bull band joined the hostiles. They had made no
    resistance to the troops, but fled immediately on their appearance.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 77</span>—Sitting Bull the Sioux medicine-man.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The fight lasted only a few minutes, but with terribly fatal result. Six policemen were killed or mortally wounded,
    including the officers Bull Head and Shave Head, and one other less seriously wounded. The hostiles lost eight
    killed, including Sitting Bull and his son Crow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_859">859</span> Foot, 17 years of
    age, with several wounded. During the fight the women attacked the police with knives and clubs, but notwithstanding
    the excitement the police simply disarmed them and put them in one of the houses under guard.</p>

      Bull’s Indians and the government police, December 15, 1890.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The warmest praise is given the Indian police for their conduct on this occasion by those who are most competent to
    judge. Some who thus faced death in obedience to orders had near relatives among those opposed to them. Agent
    McLaughlin in one official letter says that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_860">860</span> can not too
    strongly commend their splendid courage and ability in the action, and in another letter says: “The details of the
    battle show that the Indian police behaved nobly and exhibited the best of judgment and bravery, and a recognition
    by the government for their services on this occasion is richly deserved.... I respectfully urge that the Interior
    Department cooperate with the War Department in obtaining Congressional action which will secure to these brave
    survivors and to the families of the dead a full and generous reward.” Colonel Drum, under whose orders the arrest
    was made, after stating that Sitting Bull was not hurt until he began struggling to escape and until one of the
    police had been shot, adds: “It is also remarkable that no squaws or children were hurt. The police appear to have
    constantly warned the other Indians to keep away, until they were forced to fight in self-defense. It is hardly
    possible to praise their conduct too highly.” Notwithstanding the recommendation of the Commissioner of Indian
    Affairs, Congress has taken no action in recognition of their services on this occasion.</p>

  <p>Before the action orders had been sent to the police to have with them a wagon, in order to convey Sitting Bull
    quickly away from the camp, so as to avoid trouble, but in the excitement of preparation this was overlooked. The
    police returned to the agency late in the afternoon, bringing with them their dead and wounded, together with two
    prisoners and the body of Sitting Bull, which was turned over to the military authorities at Fort Yates. The four
    dead policemen were buried at the agency next day with military honors. Bull Head and Shave Head died in the
    hospital soon afterward, with the consolation of having their friends around them in their last moments. The agent
    states that the large majority of the Indians were loyal to the government, and expressed satisfaction at what they
    considered the termination of the disturbance. Couriers were again sent after the fleeing Indians by McLaughlin,
    warning them to return to the agency, where they would be safe, or suffer the consequences if found outside the
    reservation. Within a few days nearly 250 had come in and surrendered, leaving only about one-third still out. Most
    of these soon afterward surrendered with Hump on Cherry creek, while the remainder, about 50, joined Big Foot or
    went on to Pine Ridge. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 36; <a href="#War">War</a>, 8.</i>)</p>

  <p>Thus died Tata′nka I′yota′nke, Sitting Bull, the great medicine-man of the Sioux, on the morning of December 15,
    1890, aged about 56 years. He belonged to the Uncpapa division of the Teton Sioux. Although a priest rather than a
    chief, he had gained a reputation in his early years by organizing and leading war parties, and became prominent by
    his participation in the battle of Little Bighorn, in Montana, on June 25, 1876, by which Custer’s command was wiped
    out of existence. Being pursued by General Terry, Sitting Bull and his band made their escape northward into Canada,
    where they remained until 1881, when he surrendered, through the mediation of the Canadian authorities, on a<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_861">861</span> promise of pardon. To obtain subsistence while in Canada, his people
    had been obliged to sell almost all they possessed, including their firearms, so that they returned to their old
    homes in an impoverished condition. After confinement as a prisoner of war until 1883, Sitting Bull took up his
    residence on Grand river, where he remained until he met his death. Here he continued to be the leader of the
    opposition to civilization and the white man, and his camp became the rallying point for the dissatisfied
    conservative element that clung to the old order of things, and felt that innovation meant destruction to their
    race. For seven years he had steadily opposed the treaty by which the great Sioux reservation was at last broken up
    in 1889. After the treaty had been signed by the requisite number to make it a law, he was asked by a white man what
    the Indians thought about it. With a burst of passionate indignation he replied, “Indians! There are no Indians left
    now but me.” However misguided he may have been in thus continuing a losing fight against the inevitable, it is
    possible that from the Indian point of view he may have been their patriot as he was their high priest. He has been
    mercilessly denounced as a bad man and a liar; but there can be no doubt that he was honest in his hatred of the
    whites, and his breaking of the peace pipe, saying that he “wanted to fight and wanted to die,” showed that he was
    no coward. But he represented the past. His influence was incompatible with progress, and his death marks an era in
    the civilization of the Sioux. In the language of General Miles, “His tragic fate was but the ending of a tragic
    life. Since the days of Pontiac, Tecumseh, and Red Jacket no Indian has had the power of drawing to him so large a
    following of his race and molding and wielding it against the authority of the United States, or of inspiring it
    with greater animosity against the white race and civilization.” (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 9.</i>)</p>

  <p>On December 18 the Indians who had already fled to the Bad Lands attacked a small party of men on Spring creek of
    Cheyenne river. Major Tupper with 100 men of Carr’s division was sent to their rescue, and a skirmish ensued with
    the Indians, who were concealed in the bushes along the creek. The government wagons, while crossing the creek, were
    also attacked by the hostiles, who were finally driven off by reinforcements of cavalry under Captain Wells. On the
    same date over a thousand Indians returned to Pine Ridge. News was received that there were still about 1,500
    fugitives camped on Cheyenne river in the neighborhood of Spring creek. (<i><a href="#Colby">Colby</a>, 1.</i>)</p>

  <p>The most dangerous leader of dissatisfaction in the north after the death of Sitting Bull was considered to be
    Hump, on Cheyenne River reservation. The agent in charge had long before recommended his removal, but it was thought
    that it would now be next to impossible to arrest him. Hump with his band of about 400 persons, and Big Foot with
    nearly as many, had their camps about the junction of Cherry creek and Cheyenne river. For several weeks they had
    been dancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_862">862</span> almost constantly, and were very sullen and
    apparently very hostile. After serious consideration of the matter, the task of securing Hump was assigned to
    Captain E. P. Ewers of the Fifth infantry, who had had charge of this chief and his band for seven years and had
    their full confidence and respect. He was then on duty in Texas, but was ordered forward and reported soon after at
    Fort Bennett on the border of the reservation. So dangerous was Hump considered to be that the civil agents did not
    think it possible even for the officer to communicate with him. However, Captain Ewers, without troops and attended
    only by Lieutenant Hale, at once left the fort and rode out 60 miles to Hump’s camp. “Hump at the time was 20 miles
    away and a runner was sent for him. Immediately upon hearing that Captain Ewers was in the vicinity he came to him
    and was told that the division commander desired him to take his people away from the hostiles and bring them to the
    nearest military post. He replied that if General Miles sent for him, he would do whatever he desired. He
    immediately brought his people into Fort Bennett and complied with all the orders and instructions given him, and
    subsequently rendered valuable service for peace. Thus an element regarded as among the most dangerous was removed.”
    After coming into the fort, Hump enlisted as a scout under Captain Ewers, and soon afterward, in connection with the
    same Lieutenant Hale, proved his loyalty by bringing about the surrender of the Sitting Bull fugitives. Subsequently
    Captain Ewers further distinguished himself by conducting the northern Cheyenne—who were considered as particularly
    dangerous, but who regarded Captain Ewers with absolute affection—from Pine Ridge to Tongue river, Montana, a
    distance of 300 miles, and in the most rigorous of the winter season, without an escort of troops and without the
    loss of a single life or the commission by an Indian of a single unlawful act. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 10.</i>)</p>

  <p>The Sitting Bull fugitives who had not come in at once had fled southward toward their friends and near relatives
    of Cheyenne River reservation, and were camped on Cherry creek a few miles above its junction with Cheyenne river at
    Cheyenne City. As their presence there could serve only to increase the unrest among the other Indians in that
    vicinity, and as there was great danger that they might attempt to join those already in the Bad Lands, Captain
    Hurst, of the Twelfth infantry, commanding at Fort Bennett, directed Lieutenant H. E. Hale on December 18 to go out
    and bring them in. On arriving at Cheyenne City the officer found it deserted, all the citizens excepting one man
    having fled in alarm a short time before on the report of a half-blood that the Sitting Bull Indians were coming and
    had sworn to kill the first white man they met. Having succeeded in frightening the whole population, the half-blood
    himself, Narcisse Narcelle, left at once for the fort.</p>

  <p>After some difficulty in finding anyone to assist him, Hale sent a policeman to bring back Narcelle and sent out
    another Indian to learn the situation and condition of the Indian camp. His only interpreter<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_863">863</span> for the purpose was Mr Angell, the single white man who had remained, and who had
    learned some of the Sioux language during his residence among them. While thus waiting, a report came that the
    Indians had raided a ranch about 10 miles up the creek. Not hearing from his scouts, the lieutenant determined to go
    alone and find the camp, and was just about to start, when Hump, the late dangerous hostile, but now an enlisted
    scout, rode in with the news that the Sitting Bull Indians were approaching only a short distance away, and armed.
    Although from the reports there was every reason to believe that they had just destroyed a ranch and were now coming
    to attack the town, the officer, with rare bravery, kept his determination to go out and meet them, even without an
    interpreter, in the hope of preventing their hostile purpose. Hump volunteered to go with him. The two rode out
    together and soon came up with the Indians, who received them in a friendly manner. There were 46 warriors in the
    party, besides women and children, wagons and ponies. Says the officer: “I appreciated the importance of the
    situation, but was absolutely powerless to communicate with the Indians. I immediately formed the opinion that they
    could be easily persuaded to come into the agency if I could but talk with them. While I was trying by signs to make
    them understand what I wanted, Henry Angell rode into the circle and took his place at my side. This generous man
    had not liked the idea of my going among these Indians, and from a true spirit of chivalry had ridden over to ‘see
    it out.’” Verily, while such men as Ewers, Hale, and Angell live, the day of chivalry is not gone by.</p>

  <p>With Angell’s assistance as interpreter, the officer told the Indians that if they would stay where they were for
    one day, he would go back to the agency and return within that time with the chief (Captain J. H. Hurst) and an
    interpreter and no soldiers. They replied that they would not move, and, having directed Angell to kill a beef for
    them, as they were worn-out and well-nigh starving, and leaving Hump with them to reassure them, the lieutenant rode
    back to Fort Bennett, 40 miles away, notified Captain Hurst, and returned with him, Sergeant Gallagher, and two
    Indian scouts as interpreters, the next day. Knowing the importance of haste, they started out on this winter ride
    of 40 miles without blankets or rations.</p>

  <p>On arriving Captain Hurst told them briefly what he had come for, and then, being exhausted from the rapid ride,
    and knowing that an Indian must not be hurried, he ordered some beef and a plentiful supply of tobacco for them, and
    said that after he and they had eaten and rested they could talk the matter over. In the evening the principal men
    met him and told him over a pipe that they had left Standing Rock agency forever; that their great chief and friend
    Sitting Bull had been killed there without cause; that they had come down to talk with their friends on Cherry creek
    about it, but had found them gone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_864">864</span> and were consequently
    undecided as to what they should do. The captain replied that he had come as a friend; that if they would surrender
    their arms and go back with him to Fort Bennett, they would be provided for and would not be harmed; that he could
    make no promises as to their future disposition; that if they chose to join Big Foot’s camp, only a few miles up the
    river, the result would be their certain destruction. After deliberating among themselves until midnight, they came
    in a body, delivered a number of guns, and said they would go back to the fort. Accordingly they broke camp next
    morning and arrived at Fort Bennett on December 24. The entire body numbered 221, including 55 belonging on Cherry
    creek. These last were allowed to join their own people camped near the post. The Sitting Bull Indians, with some
    others from Standing Rock, numbering 227 in all, were held at Fort Sully, a few miles below Fort Bennett, until the
    close of the trouble. Thirty-eight others of the Sitting Bull band had joined Big Foot and afterward fled with him.
    (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 11.</i>)</p>

  <p>After the death of Sitting Bull and the enlistment of Hump in the government service, the only prominent leader
    outside of the Bad Lands who was considered as possibly dangerous was Sitanka or Big Foot, whose village was at the
    mouth of Deep creek, a few miles below the forks of Cheyenne river. The duty of watching him was assigned to
    Lieutenant-Colonel E. V. Sumner of the Eighth cavalry, who had his camp just above the forks. Here he was visited by
    Big Foot and his head men, who assured the officer that they were peaceable and intended to remain quietly at home.
    Friendly relations continued until the middle of December, when Big Foot came to bid good bye, telling Sumner that
    his people were all going to the agency to get their annuities. A day or two later the order came to arrest Big Foot
    and send him as a prisoner to Fort Meade. Believing that the chief was acting in good faith to control his warriors,
    who might easily go beyond control were he taken from them, Colonel Sumner informed General Miles that the Indians
    were already on their way to the agency; that if Big Foot should return he (Sumner) would try to get him, and that
    otherwise he could be arrested at the agency, if necessary. Soon after, however, the report came that Big Foot had
    stopped at Hump’s camp on the way to the agency, to meet the fugitives coming south from Sitting Bull’s camp.</p>

  <p>On receipt of this information, Sumner at once marched down the river with the intention of stopping Big Foot. When
    about half way to Hump’s camp, Big Foot himself came up to meet him, saying that he was friendly, and that he and
    his men would obey any orders that the officer might give. He stated that he had with him 100 of his own Indians and
    38 from Standing Rock (Sitting Bull’s band). When asked why he had received these last, knowing that they were
    refugees from their reservation, he replied that they were his brothers and relations; that they had come to his
    people hungry, footsore, and almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_865">865</span> naked; and that he had taken
    them in and fed them, and that no one with a heart could do any less.</p>

  <p>Sumner then directed one of his officers, Captain Hennisee, to go to the Indian camp with Big Foot and bring in all
    the Indians. That officer started and returned the next day, December 21, with 333 Indians. This large number was a
    matter of surprise in view of Big Foot’s statement shortly before, but it is possible that in speaking of his party
    he intended to refer only to the warriors. They went into camp as directed, turned out their ponies to graze, and
    were fed, and on the next morning all started quietly back with the troops. As they had all along appeared perfectly
    friendly and compliant with every order, no attempt was made to disarm them. On arriving near their own village,
    however, it became apparent that Big Foot could not control their desire to go to their homes. The chief came
    frankly to Sumner and said that he himself would go wherever wanted, but that there would be trouble to force the
    women and children, who were cold and hungry, away from their village. He protested also that they were now at home,
    where they had been ordered by the government to stay, and that none of them had done anything to justify their
    removal. As it was evident that they would not go peaceably, Colonel Sumner determined to bring his whole force on
    the next day to compel them. In the meantime he sent a white man named Dunn, who had a friendly acquaintance with
    Big Foot, to tell him that the Indians must obey the order to remove. Dunn delivered the message and returned, being
    followed later by the interpreter, with the statement that the Indians had consented to go to the agency, and would
    start the next morning, December 23. That evening, however, scouts came in with the word that the Indians had left
    their village and were going southward. It was at first thought that they intended turning off on another trail to
    the agency, but instead of doing so they kept on in the direction of Pine Ridge and the refugees in the Bad Lands,
    taking with them only their ponies and tipi poles.</p>

  <p>The cause of this precipitate flight after the promise given by Big Foot is somewhat uncertain. The statement of
    the interpreter, Felix Benoit, would make it appear that the Indians were frightened by Dunn, who told them that the
    soldiers were coming in the morning to carry them off and to shoot them if they refused to go. While this doubtless
    had the effect of alarming them, the real cause of their flight was probably the fact that just at this critical
    juncture Colonel Merriam was ordered to move with his command up Cheyenne river to join forces with Sumner in
    compelling their surrender. Such is the opinion of General Ruger, who states officially that “Big Foot and adherents
    who had joined him, probably becoming alarmed on the movement of Colonel Merriam’s command from Fort Bennett and a
    rumor that Colonel Sumner would capture them, eluded Colonel Sumner’s command and started for the Pine Ridge
    reservation.” This agrees with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_866">866</span> the statement of several of the
    survivors that they had been frightened from their homes by the news of Merriam’s approach. Sumner, in his report,
    calls attention to the fact that they committed no depredations in their flight, although they passed several
    ranches and at one time even went through a pasture filled with horses and cattle without attempting to appropriate
    them. He also expresses the opinion that Big Foot was compelled unwillingly to go with his people. The whole number
    of fugitives was at least 340, including a few from the bands of Sitting Bull and Hump. Immediately on learning of
    their flight Colonel Sumner notified General Carr, commanding in the direction of the Bad Lands. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 12.</i>)</p>

  <p>The situation at this crisis is thus summed up by Indian Commissioner Morgan:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Groups of Indians from the different reservations had commenced concentrating in the Bad Lands upon or in the
      vicinity of the Pine Ridge reservation. Killing of cattle and destruction of other property by these Indians,
      almost entirely within the limits of Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations, occurred, but no signal fires were
      built, no warlike demonstrations were made, no violence was done to any white settler, nor was there cohesion or
      organization among the Indians themselves. Many of them were friendly Indians, who had never participated in the
      ghost dance, but had fled thither from fear of soldiers, in consequence of the Sitting Bull affair or through the
      overpersuasion of friends. The military gradually began to close in around them and they offered no resistance,
      and a speedy and quiet capitulation of all was confidently expected. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 34.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Nearly 3,000 troops were now in the field in the Sioux country. This force was fully sufficient to have engaged the
    Indians with success, but as such action must inevitably have resulted in wholesale killing on both sides, with the
    prospect of precipitating a raiding warfare unless the hostiles were completely annihilated, it was thought best to
    bring about a surrender by peaceful means.</p>

  <p>The refugees in the Bad Lands who had fled from Pine Ridge and Rosebud had been surrounded on the west and north by
    a strong cordon of troops, operating under General Brooke, which had the effect of gradually forcing them back
    toward the agency. At the same time that officer made every effort to expedite the process by creating dissensions
    in the Indian camp, and trying in various ways to induce them to come in by small parties at a time. To this end the
    Indians were promised that if they complied with the orders of the military their rights and interests would be
    protected, so far as it was within the power of the military department to accomplish that result. Although they had
    about lost confidence in the government, these assurances had a good effect, which was emphasized by the news of the
    death of Sitting Bull, the arrest of Big Foot, and return of Hump to his agency, and the steady pressure of the
    troops from behind; and on December 27, 1890, the entire force broke camp and left their stronghold in the Bad Lands
    and began moving in toward the agency at Pine Ridge. The several detachments of troops followed behind,<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_867">867</span> within supporting distance of one another, and so closely that the
    fires were still burning in the Indian camps when the soldiers moved in to occupy the same ground. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 13.</i>)</p>

  <p>As early as December 6 a conference had been brought about at Pine Ridge, through the efforts of Father Jutz, the
    priest of the Catholic mission, between General Brooke and the leading chiefs of both friendlies and “hostiles.”
    Although no definite conclusion was reached, the meeting was a friendly one, ending with a feast and an Indian
    dance. The immediate effect was a division in the hostile camp, culminating in a quarrel between the two factions,
    with the result that Two Strike and his party left the rest and moved in toward the agency, while Short Bull and
    Kicking Bear retreated farther into the Bad Lands. On learning of this condition of affairs, General Brooke sent out
    American Horse and Big Road with a large party of warriors to meet Two Strike and go back with him to persuade the
    others, if possible, to come in. At the same time the troops were moved up to intercept the flight of the hostiles.
    (<i><a href="#Colby">Colby</a>, 2; <a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 37.</i>)</p>

  <p>On Christmas day the Cheyenne scouts, camped on Battle creek north of the Bad Lands, were attacked by a party of
    hostiles led by Kicking Bear in person. The fight was kept up until after dark, several being killed or wounded on
    both sides, but the hostiles were finally driven off. (<i><a href="#Colby">Colby</a>, 3.</i>)</p>

  <p>But the tragedy was near at hand. Orders had been given to intercept Big Foot’s party in its flight from Cheyenne
    river toward the Bad Lands. This was accomplished on December 28, 1890, by Major Whitside of the Seventh cavalry,
    who came up with him a short distance west of the Bad Lands. Not having succeeded in communicating with the refugees
    who had fled there and who were already on their way to the agency, Big Foot had made no stop, but continued on also
    toward Pine Ridge. On sighting the troops he raised a white flag, advanced into the open country, and asked for a
    parley. This was refused by Major Whitside, who demanded an unconditional surrender, which was at once given, and
    the Indians moved on with the troops to Wounded Knee creek, about 20 miles northeast of Pine Ridge agency, where
    they camped as directed by Major Whitside. In order to make assurance complete, General Brooke sent Colonel Forsyth
    to join Major Whitside with four additional troops of the Seventh cavalry, which, with the scouts under Lieutenant
    Taylor, made up a force of eight troops of cavalry, one company of scouts, and four pieces of light artillery
    (Hotchkiss guns), with a total force of 470 men, as against a total of 106 warriors then present in Big Foot’s band.
    A scouting party of Big Foot’s band was out looking for the camp under Kicking Bear and Short Bull, but as these
    chiefs, with their followers, were already on their way to the agency, the scouting party was returning to rejoin
    Big Foot when the fight occurred the next morning. It was the intention of General Miles to send Big Foot and his
    followers back to their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_868">868</span> reservation, or to remove them
    altogether from the country until the excitement had subsided. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 14.</i>)</p>

  <p>At this time there were no Indians in the Bad Lands. Two Strike and Crow Dog had come in about a week before and
    were now camped close to the agency. Kicking Bear and Short Bull, with their followers, had yielded to the friendly
    persuasions of American Horse, Little Wound, Standing Bear, and others who had gone out to them in the interests of
    peace, and both parties were now coming in together and had arrived at the Catholic mission, 5 miles from the
    agency, when the battle occurred.</p>

  <p>On the morning of December 29, 1890, preparations were made to disarm the Indians preparatory to taking them to the
    agency and thence to the railroad. In obedience to instructions the Indians had pitched their tipis on the open
    plain a short distance west of the creek and surrounded on all sides by the soldiers. In the center of the camp the
    Indians had hoisted a white flag as a sign of peace and a guarantee of safety. Behind them was a dry ravine running
    into the creek, and on a slight rise in the front was posted the battery of four Hotchkiss machine guns, trained
    directly on the Indian camp. In front, behind, and on both flanks of the camp were posted the various troops of
    cavalry, a portion of two troops, together with the Indian scouts, being dismounted and drawn up in front of the
    Indians at the distance of only a few yards from them. Big Foot himself was ill of pneumonia in his tipi, and
    Colonel Forsyth, who had taken command as senior officer, had provided a tent warmed with a camp stove for his
    reception.</p>

  <p>Shortly after 8 oclock in the morning the warriors were ordered to come out from the tipis and deliver their arms.
    They came forward and seated themselves on the ground in front of the troops. They were then ordered to go by
    themselves into their tipis and bring out and surrender their guns. The first twenty went and returned in a short
    time with only two guns. It seemed evident that they were unwilling to give them up, and after consultation of the
    officers part of the soldiers were ordered up to within ten yards of the group of warriors, while another detachment
    of troops was ordered to search the tipis. After a thorough hunt these last returned with about forty rifles, most
    of which, however, were old and of little value. The search had consumed considerable time and created a good deal
    of excitement among the women and children, as the soldiers found it necessary in the process to overturn the beds
    and other furniture of the tipis and in some instances drove out the inmates. All this had its effect on their
    husbands and brothers, already wrought up to a high nervous tension and not knowing what might come next. While the
    soldiers had been looking for the guns Yellow Bird, a medicine-man, had been walking about among the warriors,
    blowing on an eagle-bone whistle, and urging them to resistance, telling them that the soldiers would become weak
    and powerless, and that the bullets would be unavailing against the sacred “ghost shirts,” which nearly every one of
    the Indians wore. As he spoke in the Sioux language, the officers did not at once realize the dangerous drift of his
    talk, and the climax came too quickly for them to interfere. It is said one of the searchers now attempted to raise
    the blanket of a warrior. Suddenly Yellow Bird stooped down and threw a handful of dust into the air, when, as if
    this were the signal, a young Indian, said to have been Black Fox from Cheyenne river, drew a rifle from under his
    blanket and fired at the soldiers, who instantly replied with a volley directly into the crowd of warriors and so
    near that their guns were almost touching. From the number of sticks set up by the Indians to mark where the dead
    fell, as seen by the author a year later, this one volley must have killed nearly half the warriors
    (<a href="#plate_xcix">plate <span class="smcap">xcix</span></a>). The survivors sprang to their feet, throwing their blankets from their shoulders as
    they rose, and for a few minutes there was a terrible hand to hand struggle, where every man’s thought was to kill.
    Although many of the warriors had no guns, nearly all had revolvers and knives in their belts under their blankets,
    together with some of the murderous warclubs still carried by the Sioux. The very lack of guns made the fight more
    bloody, as it brought the combatants to closer quarters.</p>

    <p>Just beyond the limit of the map, toward the west, the ravine forms a bend, in which a number of hostiles took
      refuge, and from which Lieutenant Hawthorne was shot. Captain Wallace was found near the center of the council ring.
      Big Foot was killed two or three yards in front of his tent. Father Craft was near the center of the ring when
      stabbed. The Indians broke to the west through B and K troops. While in the council ring all the warriors had on
      blankets, with their arms, principally Winchester rifles, concealed under them. Most of the warriors, including the
      medicine-man, were painted and wore ghost shirts.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_869">869</span></p>

  <p>At the first volley the Hotchkiss guns trained on the camp opened fire and sent a storm of shells and bullets among
    the women and children, who had gathered in front of the tipis to watch the unusual spectacle of military display.
    The guns poured in 2-pound explosive shells at the rate of nearly fifty per minute, mowing down everything alive.
    The terrible effect may be judged from the fact that one woman survivor, Blue Whirlwind, with whom the author
    conversed, received fourteen wounds, while each of her two little boys was also wounded by her side. In a few
    minutes 200 Indian men, women, and children, with 60 soldiers, were lying dead and wounded on the ground, the tipis
    had been torn down by the shells and some of them were burning above the helpless wounded, and the surviving handful
    of Indians were flying in wild panic to the shelter of the ravine, pursued by hundreds of maddened soldiers and
    followed up by a raking fire from the Hotchkiss guns, which had been moved into position to sweep the ravine.</p>

  <p>There can be no question that the pursuit was simply a massacre, where fleeing women, with infants in their arms,
    were shot down after resistance had ceased and when almost every warrior was stretched dead or dying on the ground.
    On this point such a careful writer as Herbert Welsh says: “From the fact that so many women and children were
    killed, and that their bodies were found far from the scene of action, and as though they were shot down while
    flying, it would look as though blind rage had been at work, in striking contrast to the moderation of the Indian
    police at the Sitting Bull fight when they were assailed by women.” (<i><a href="#Welsh">Welsh</a>, 3.</i>) The testimony of American
    Horse and other friendlies is strong in the same direction. (See <a href="#Page_839">page 839</a>.)
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_870">870</span>Commissioner Morgan in his official report says that “Most of the men, including Big Foot, were
    killed around his tent, where he lay sick. The bodies of the women and children were scattered along a distance of
    two miles from the scene of the encounter.” (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 35.</i>)</p>

  <p>This is no reflection on the humanity of the officer in charge. On the contrary, Colonel Forsyth had taken measures
    to guard against such an occurrence by separating the women and children, as already stated, and had also endeavored
    to make the sick chief, Big Foot, as comfortable as possible, even to the extent of sending his own surgeon, Dr
    Glennan, to wait on him on the night of the surrender. Strict orders had also been issued to the troops that women
    and children were not to be hurt. The butchery was the work of infuriated soldiers whose comrades had just been shot
    down without cause or warning. In justice to a brave regiment it must be said that a number of the men were new
    recruits fresh from eastern recruiting stations, who had never before been under fire, were not yet imbued with
    military discipline, and were probably unable in the confusion to distinguish between men and women by their dress.</p>

  <p>After examining all the official papers bearing on the subject in the files of the War Department and the Indian
    Office, together with the official reports of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and of the Secretary of War and the
    several officers engaged; after gathering all that might be obtained from unofficial printed sources and from
    conversation with survivors and participants in the engagement on both sides, and after going over the battle-ground
    in company with the interpreter of the scouts engaged, the author arrives at the conclusion that when the sun rose
    on Wounded Knee on the fatal morning of December 29, 1890, no trouble was anticipated or premeditated by either
    Indians or troops; that the Indians in good faith desired to surrender and be at peace, and that the officers in the
    same good faith had made preparations to receive their surrender and escort them quietly to the reservation; that in
    spite of the pacific intent of Big Foot and his band, the medicine-man, Yellow Bird, at the critical moment urged
    the warriors to resistance and gave the signal for the attack; that the first shot was fired by an Indian, and that
    the Indians were responsible for the engagement; that the answering volley and attack by the troops was right and
    justifiable, but that the wholesale slaughter of women and children was unnecessary and inexcusable.</p>

  <p>Authorities differ as to the number of Indians present and killed at Wounded Knee. General Ruger states that the
    band numbered about 340, including about 100 warriors, but Major Whitside, to whom they surrendered, reported them
    officially as numbering 120 men and 250 women and children, a total of 370. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 15</i>; <i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 38</i>.) This
    agrees almost exactly with the statement made to the author by Mr Asay, a trader who was present at the surrender.
    General Miles says that there were present 106 warriors, a few others being absent at the time in<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_871">871</span> search of the party under Kicking Bear and Short Bull. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 16.</i>)
    Among those who surrendered were about 70 refugees from the bands of Sitting Bull and Hump. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 39.</i>)
    No exact account of the dead could be made immediately after the fight, on account of a second attack by
    another party of Indians coming up from the agency. Some of the dead and wounded left on the field were undoubtedly
    carried off by their friends before the burial party came out three days later, and of those brought in alive a
    number afterward died of wounds and exposure, but received no notice in the official reports. The Adjutant-General,
    in response to a letter of inquiry, states that 128 Indians were killed and 33 wounded. Commissioner Morgan, in his
    official report, makes the number killed 146. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 36.</i>) Both these estimates are evidently too low.
    General Miles, in his final report, states that about 200 men, women, and children were killed. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 17.</i>)
    General Colby, who commanded the Nebraska state troops, says that about 100 men and over 120 women and children were
    found dead on the field, a total of about 220. (<i><a href="#Colby">Colby</a>, 4.</i>) Agent Royer telegraphed immediately after the
    fight that about 300 Indians had been killed, and General Miles, telegraphing on the same day, says, “I think very
    few Indians have escaped.” (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 40.</i>) Fifty-one Indians were brought in the same day by the troops, and a
    few others were found still alive by the burial party three days later. A number of these afterward died. No
    considerable number got away, being unable to reach their ponies after the fight began. General Miles states that 98
    warriors were killed on the field. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 18.</i>) The whole number killed on the field, or who later died from
    wounds and exposure, was probably very nearly 300.</p>

  <p>According to an official statement from the Adjutant-General, 31 soldiers were killed in the battle. About as many
    more were wounded, one or two of whom afterward died. All of the killed, excepting Hospital Steward Pollock and an
    Indian scout named High Backbone, belonged to the Seventh cavalry, as did probably also nearly all of the wounded.
    The only commissioned officer killed was Captain Wallace. He received four bullet wounds in his body and finally
    sank under a hatchet stroke upon the head. Lieutenant E. A. Garlington, of the Seventh cavalry, and Lieutenant H. L.
    Hawthorne, of the Second artillery, were wounded. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 19.</i>) The last-named officer owed his life to his
    watch, which deflected the bullet that otherwise would have passed through his body.</p>

  <p>Below is given a complete list of officers and enlisted men who were killed, or died of wounds or exposure, in
    connection with the Sioux campaign. The statement is contained in an official letter of reply from the
    Adjutant-General’s office dated May 26, 1894. Unless otherwise noted all were of the Seventh cavalry and were killed
    on December 29, the date of the battle of Wounded Knee. In addition to these, two others, Henry Miller, a herder,
    and George Wilhauer, of the Nebraska militia, were killed in the same connection. With the 6<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_872">872</span> Indian police killed in arresting Sitting Bull, this makes a total of 49 deaths on
    the government side, including 7 Indians and a negro:</p>

  <p>The heroic missionary priest, Father Craft, who had given a large part of his life to work among the Sioux, by whom
    he was loved and respected, had endeavored at the beginning of the trouble to persuade the stampeded Indians to come
    into the agency, but without success, the Indians claiming that no single treaty ever made with them had been
    fulfilled in all its stipulations. Many of the soldiers being of his own faith, he accompanied the detachment which
    received the surrender of Big Foot, to render such good offices as might be possible to either party. In the
    desperate encounter he was stabbed through the lungs, but yet, with bullets flying about him and hatchets and
    warclubs circling through the air, he went about his work, administering the last religious consolation to the dying
    until he fell unconscious from loss of blood. He was brought back to the agency along with the other wounded, and
    although his life was despaired of for some time, he finally recovered. In talking about Wounded Knee with one of
    the friendly warriors who had gone into the Bad Lands to urge the hostiles to come in, he spoke with warm admiration
    of Father Craft, and I asked why it was, then, that the Indians had tried to kill him. He replied, “They did not
    know him. Father Jutz [the priest at the Drexel Catholic mission, previously mentioned] always wears his black robe,
    but Father Craft on that day wore a soldier’s cap and overcoat. If he had worn his black robe, no Indian would have
    hurt him.” On <span class="pagenum" id="Page_873">873</span>inquiring afterward I learned that this was not
    correct, as Father Craft did have on his priestly robes. From the Indian statement, however, and the well-known
    affection in which he was held by the Sioux, it is probable that the Indian who stabbed him was too much excited at
    the moment to recognize him.</p>

    <figcaption class="clear xsmall">AFTER THE BATTLE</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The news of the battle was brought to the agency by Lieutenant Guy Preston, of the Ninth cavalry, who, in company
    with a soldier and an Indian scout, made the ride of 16 or 18 miles in a little over an hour, one horse falling dead
    of exhaustion on the way. There were then at the agency, under command of General Brooke, about 300 men of the
    Second infantry and 50 Indian police.</p>

  <p>The firing at Wounded Knee was plainly heard by the thousands of Indians camped about the agency at Pine Ridge, who
    had come in from the Bad Lands to surrender. They were at once thrown into great excitement, undoubtedly believing
    that there was a deliberate purpose on foot to disarm and massacre them all, and when the fugitives—women and
    children, most of them—began to come in, telling the story of the terrible slaughter of their friends and showing
    their bleeding wounds in evidence, the camp was divided between panic and desperation. A number of warriors mounted
    in haste and made all speed to the battle-ground, only about two hours distant, where they met the troops, who were
    now scattered about, hunting down the fugitives who might have escaped the first killing, and picking up the dead
    and wounded. The soldiers were driven in toward the center, where they threw up entrenchments, by means of which
    they were finally able to repel the attacking party. With the assistance of a body of Indian scouts and police, they
    then gathered up the dead and wounded soldiers, with some of the wounded Indians and a few other prisoners to the
    number of 51, and came into the agency. In the meantime the hostiles under Two Strike had opened fire on the agency
    from the neighboring hills and endeavored to approach, by way of a deep ravine, near enough to set fire to the
    buildings. General Brooke, desiring to avoid a general engagement, ordered out the Indian police—a splendidly
    drilled body of 50 brave men—who gallantly took their stand in the center of the agency inclosure, in full view of
    the hostiles, some of whom were their own relatives, and kept them off, returning the fire of besiegers with such
    good effect as to kill two and wound several others. The attacking party, as well as those who rode out to help
    their kinsmen at Wounded Knee, were not the Pine Ridge Indians (Ogalala) but the Brulé from Rosebud under the lead
    of Two Strike, Kicking Bear, and Short Bull. On the approach of the detachment returning from Wounded Knee almost
    the entire body that had come in to surrender broke away and fell back to a position on White Clay creek, where the
    next day found a camp of 4,000 Indians, and including more than a thousand warriors now thoroughly hostile. On the
    evening of the battle General Miles telegraphed to military headquarters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_874">
    874</span> “Last night everything looked favorable for getting all the Indians under control; since report from
    Forsyth it looks more serious than at any other time.” (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 41.</i>) It seemed that all the careful work of
    the last month had been undone.</p>

  <p>At the first indication of coming trouble in November all the outlying schools and mission stations on Pine Ridge
    reservation had been abandoned, and teachers, farmers, and missionaries had fled to the agency to seek the
    protection of the troops, all but the members of the Drexel Catholic mission, 5 miles northwest from the agency.
    Here the two or three priests and five Franciscan sisters remained quietly at their post, with a hundred little
    children around them, safe in the assurance of the “hostiles” that they would not be molested. While the fighting
    was going on at Wounded Knee and hundreds of furious warriors were firing into the agency, where the handful of
    whites were shivering in spite of the presence of troops and police, these gentle women and the kindly old German
    priest were looking after the children, feeding the frightened fugitive women, and tenderly caring for the wounded
    Indians who were being brought in from Wounded Knee and the agency. Throughout all these weeks of terror they went
    calmly about the duties to which they had consecrated their lives, and kept their little flock together and their
    school in operation, without the presence of a single soldier, completely cut off from the troops and the agency and
    surrounded by thousands of wild Indians.</p>

  <p>Some time afterward, in talking with the Indians about the events of the campaign, the warrior who had spoken with
    such admiration of Father Craft referred with the same affectionate enthusiasm to Father Jutz, and said that when
    the infuriated Indians attacked the agency on hearing of the slaughter at Wounded Knee they had sent word to the
    mission that no one there need be afraid. “We told him to stay where he was and no Indian would disturb him,” said
    the warrior. He told how the priest and the sisters had fed the starving refugees and bound up the wounds of the
    survivors who escaped the slaughter, and then after a pause he said: “He is a brave man; braver than any Indian.”
    Curious to know why this man had not joined the hostiles, among whom were several of his near relatives, I asked him
    the question. His reply was simple: “I had a little boy at the Drexel mission. He died and Father Jutz put a white
    stone over him. That is why I did not join the hostiles.”</p>

  <p>While visiting Pine Ridge in 1891 I went out to see the Drexel school and found Father John Jutz, a simple, kindly
    old German from the Tyrol, with one or two other German lay brothers and five Franciscan sisters, Americans.
    Although but a recent establishment, the school was in flourishing condition, bearing in everything the evidences of
    orderly industry. Like a true German of the Alps, Father Jutz had already devised a way to make jelly from the wild
    plums and excellent wine from the chokecherry. While talking, the recess hour arrived and <span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_875">875</span>a bevy of small children came trooping in, pushing over one another in the effort to
    get hold of a finger of the good father, or at least to hold on to his robe while he led them into another room
    where one of the sisters gave to each a ginger cake, hot from the oven. The room was filled with the shouts and
    laughter of the children and the father explained, “Children get hungry, and we always have some cakes for the
    little ones at recess. I let the boys be noisy in the playroom as long as they don’t fight. It is good for them.”
    Looking at the happy, noisy crowd around the black-gowned missionary and sister, it was easy to see how they had
    felt safe in the affection of the Indians through all the days and nights when others were trembling behind
    breastworks and files of soldiers. Referring to what the Indians had told me, I asked Father Jutz if it was true
    that the hostiles had sent word to them not to be afraid. He replied, “Yes; they had sent word that no one in the
    mission need be alarmed,” and then, with a gentle smile, he added, “But it was never our intention to leave.” It was
    plain enough that beneath the quiet exterior there burned the old missionary fire of Jogues and Marquette.</p>

    <figcaption class="xsmall">BATTLEFIELD OF WOUNDED KNEE</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The conflict at Wounded Knee bore speedy fruit. On the same day, as has been said, a part of the Indians under Two
    Strike attacked the agency and the whole body of nearly 4,000 who had come in to surrender started back again to
    intrench themselves in preparation for renewed hostilities. On the morning of December 30, the next day after the
    fight, the wagon train of the Ninth cavalry (colored) was attacked within 2 miles of the agency while coming in with
    supplies. One soldier was killed, but the Indians were repulsed with the loss of several of their number.</p>

  <p>On the same day news came to the agency that the hostiles had attacked the Catholic mission 5 miles out, and
    Colonel Forsyth with eight troops of the Seventh cavalry and one piece of artillery was ordered by General Brooke to
    go out and drive them off. It proved that the hostiles had set fire to several houses between the mission and the
    agency, but the mission had not been disturbed. As the troops approached the hostiles fell back, but Forsyth failed
    to occupy the commanding hills and was consequently surrounded by the Indians, who endeavored to draw him into a
    canyon and pressed him so closely that he was obliged to send back three times for reinforcements. Major Henry had
    just arrived at the agency with a detachment of the Ninth cavalry, and on hearing the noise of the firing started at
    once to the relief of Forsyth with four troops of cavalry and a Hotchkiss gun. On arriving on the ground he occupied
    the hills and thus succeeded in driving off the hostiles without further casualty, and rescued the Seventh from its
    dangerous position. In this skirmish, known as the “mission fight,” the Seventh lost one officer, Lieutenant Mann,
    and a private, Dominic Francischetti, killed, and seven wounded. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 20; <a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 42.</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_876">876</span></p>

  <p>The conduct of the colored troops of the Ninth cavalry on this occasion deserves the highest commendation. At the
    time of the battle at Wounded Knee, the day before, they were in the Bad Lands, about 80 or 90 miles out from Pine
    Ridge, when the order was sent for them to come in to aid in repelling the attack on the agency. By riding all night
    they arrived at the agency at daylight, together with two Hotchkiss guns, in charge of Lieutenant John Hayden of the
    First artillery. Hardly had they dismounted when word arrived that their wagon train, coming on behind, was
    attacked, and they were obliged to go out again to its relief, as already described. On coming in again they lay
    down to rest after their long night ride, when they were once more called out to go to the aid of the Seventh at the
    mission. Jumping into the saddle they rode at full speed to the mission, 5 miles out, repelled the hostiles and
    saved the command, and returned to the agency, after having ridden over 100 miles and fought two engagements within
    thirty hours. Lieutenant Hayden, with his Hotchkiss, who had come in with them from the Bad Lands, took part also
    with them in the mission fight.</p>

  <p>On the same evening Standing Soldier, an Indian scout, arrived at the agency with a party of 65 Indians, including
    18 men. These were a part of Big Foot’s or Short Bull’s following, who had lost their way during the flight from
    Cheyenne river and were hunting for the rest of the band when captured by the scouts. They were not aware of the
    death of Big Foot and the extermination of his band, but after having been disarmed and put under guard they were
    informed of it, but only in a mild way, in order not to provoke undue excitement. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 43.</i>)</p>

  <p>Immediately after the battle of Wounded Knee, in consequence of the panic among the frontier settlers of Nebraska,
    the Nebraska state troops were called out under command of General L. W. Colby. They were stationed at the most
    exposed points between the settlements and the reservation and remained in the field until the surrender of the
    hostiles two weeks later. The only casualty among them was the death of private George Wilhauer, who was
    accidentally shot by a picket. (<i><a href="#Colby">Colby</a>, 5.</i>)</p>

  <p>On New Year’s day of 1891, three days after the battle, a detachment of troops was sent out to Wounded Knee to
    gather up and bury the Indian dead and to bring in the wounded who might be still alive on the field. In the
    meantime there had been a heavy snowstorm, culminating in a blizzard. The bodies of the slaughtered men, women, and
    children were found lying about under the snow, frozen stiff and covered with blood (<a href="#plate_xcviii">plate <span
    class="smcap">xcviii</span></a>). Almost all the dead warriors were found lying near where the fight began, about
    Big Foot’s tipi, but the bodies of the women and children were found scattered along for 2 miles from the scene of
    the encounter, showing that they had been killed while trying to escape. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 37; <a href="#Colby">Colby</a>, 6.</i>) A number of
    women and children were found still alive, but all badly wounded or frozen, or both, and most of them died after
    being brought in. Four babies were found <span class="pagenum" id="Page_877">877</span>alive under the snow,
    wrapped in shawls and lying beside their dead mothers, whose last thought had been of them. They were all badly
    frozen and only one lived. The tenacity of life so characteristic of wild people as well as of wild beasts was
    strikingly illustrated in the case of these wounded and helpless Indian women and children who thus lived three days
    through a Dakota blizzard, without food, shelter, or attention to their wounds. It is a commentary on our boasted
    Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_878">878</span> civilization that although there were two or three
    salaried missionaries at the agency not one went out to say a prayer over the poor mangled bodies of these victims
    of war. The Catholic priests had reasons for not being present, as one of them, Father Craft, was lying in the
    hospital with a dangerous wound received on the battlefield while bravely administering to the dying wants of the
    soldiers in the heat of the encounter, and the other, Father Jutz, an old man of 70 years, was at the mission school
    5 miles away, still attending to his little flock of 100 children as before the trouble began, and unaware of what
    was transpiring at the agency.</p>

  <p>A long trench was dug and into it were thrown all the bodies, piled one upon another like so much cordwood, until
    the pit was full, when the earth was heaped over them and the funeral was complete (<a href="#plate_c">plate <span
    class="smcap">c</span></a>). Many of the bodies were stripped by the whites, who went out in order to get the
    “ghost shirts,” and the frozen bodies were thrown into the trench stiff and naked. They were only dead Indians. As
    one of the burial party said, “It was a thing to melt the heart of a man, if it was <span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_879">879</span>of stone, to see those little children, with their bodies shot to pieces, thrown
    naked into the pit.” The dead soldiers had already been brought in and buried decently at the agency. When the
    writer visited the spot the following winter, the Indians had put up a wire fence around the trench and smeared the
    posts with sacred red medicine paint (<a href="#plate_ci">plate <span class="smcap">ci</span></a>).</p>

  <p>A baby girl of only three or four months was found under the snow, carefully wrapped up in a shawl, beside her dead
    mother, whose body was pierced by two bullets. On her head was a little cap of buckskin, upon which the American
    flag was embroidered in bright beadwork. She had lived through all the exposure, being only slightly frozen, and
    soon recovered after being brought into the agency. Her mother being killed, and, in all probability, her father
    also, she was adopted by General Colby, commanding the Nebraska state troops. The Indian women in camp gave her the
    poetic name of Zitkala-noni, “Lost Bird,” and by the family of her adoption she was baptized under the name of
    Marguerite (<a href="#fig_80">figure 80</a>). She is now (1896) living in the general’s family at Washington, a chubby little girl 6 years
    of age, as happy with her dolls and playthings as a little girl of that age ought to be.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_880">880</span></p>

  <p>Another little girl about 5 years of age was picked up on the battlefield and brought in by the Indian police on
    the afternoon of the fight. She was adopted by George Sword, captain of the Indian police, and is now living with
    him under the name of Jennie Sword, a remarkably pretty little girl, gentle and engaging in her manners (<a href="#fig_81">figure 81</a>).</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 82</span>—Survivors of Wounded Knee—Herbert Zitkalazi (1892).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>A little boy of four years, the son of Yellow Bird, the medicine-man, was playing on his pony in front of a tipi
    when the firing began. As he described it some time ago in lisping English: “My father ran and fell down and the
    blood came out of his mouth [he was shot through the head], and then a soldier put his gun up to my white pony’s
    nose and shot him, and then I ran and a policeman got me.” As his father was thus killed and his mother was already
    dead, he was adopted by Mrs Lucy Arnold, who had been a teacher among the Sioux and knew his <span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_881">881</span>family before the trouble began. She had already given him his name, Herbert
    Zitkalazi, the last word being the Sioux form of his father’s name, “Yellow Bird.” She brought him back with her to
    Washington, where he soon learned English and became a general favorite of all who knew him for his affectionate
    disposition and unusual intelligence, with genuine boyish enthusiasm in all he undertook. His picture here given
    (<a href="#fig_82">figure 82</a>) is from a photograph made in Lafayette park, Washington, in 1892. His adopted mother having resumed her
    school work among his tribe, he is now back with her, attending school under her supervision at Standing Rock,
    where, as in Washington, he seems to be a natural leader among those of his own age. When we think of these children
    and consider that only by the merest accident they escaped the death that overtook a hundred other children at
    Wounded Knee, who may all have had in themselves the same possibilities of affection, education, and happy
    usefulness, we can understand the sickening meaning of such affairs as the Chivington massacre in Colorado and the
    Custer fight on the Washita, where the newspaper reports merely that “the enemy was surprised and the Indian camp
    destroyed.”</p>

  <p>The Indian scouts at Wounded Knee, like the Indian police at Grand river and Pine Ridge, were brave and loyal, as
    has been the almost universal rule with Indians when enlisted in the government service, even when called on, as
    were these, to serve against their own tribe and relatives. The prairie Indian is a born soldier, with all the
    soldier’s pride of loyalty to duty, and may be trusted implicitly after he has once consented to enter the service.
    The scouts at Wounded Knee were Sioux, with Philip Wells as interpreter. Other Sioux scouts were ranging the country
    between the agency and the hostile camp in the Bad Lands, and acted as mediators in the peace negotiations which led
    to the final surrender. Fifty Cheyenne and about as many Crow scouts were also employed in the same section of
    country. Throughout the entire campaign the Indian scouts and police were faithful and received the warmest
    commendation of their officers.</p>

  <p>On New Year’s day, 1891, Henry Miller, a herder, was killed by Indians a few miles from the agency. This was the
    only noncombatant killed by the Indians during the entire campaign, and during the same period there was no
    depredation committed by them outside of the reservation. On the next day the agent reported that the school
    buildings and Episcopal church on White Clay creek had been burned by hostiles, who were then camped to the number
    of about 3,000 on Grass creek, 15 miles northeast of the agency. They had captured the government beef herd and were
    depending on it for food. Red Cloud, Little Wound, and their people were with them and were reported as anxious to
    return, but prevented by the hostile leaders, Two Strike, Short Bull, and Kicking Bear, who threatened to kill the
    first one who made a move to come in. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 44.</i>) A few days later a number of<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_882">882</span> Red Cloud’s men came in and surrendered and reported that the old chief was
    practically a prisoner and wanted the soldiers to come and rescue him from the hostiles, who were trying to force
    him into the war. They reported further that there was much suffering from cold and hunger in the Indian camp, and
    that all the Ogalala (Red Cloud’s people of Pine Ridge) were intending to come in at once in a body.</p>

  <p>On the 3d of January General Miles took up his headquarters at Pine Ridge and directed General Brooke to assume
    immediate command of the troops surrounding the hostile camp. Brooke’s men swung out to form the western and
    northern part of a circle about the hostiles, cutting them off from the Bad Lands, while the troops under General
    Carr closed in on the east and northeast in such a way that the Indians were hemmed in and unable to make a move in
    any direction excepting toward the agency.</p>

  <p>On January 3 a party of hostiles attacked a detachment of the Sixth cavalry under Captain Kerr on Grass creek, a
    few miles north of the agency, but were quickly repulsed with the loss of four of their number, the troops having
    been reinforced by other detachments in the vicinity. In this engagement the Indian scouts again distinguished
    themselves. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 21.</i>) The effect of this repulse was to check the westward movement of the hostiles and hold
    them in their position along White Clay creek until their passion had somewhat abated.</p>

  <p>On January 5 there was another encounter on Wounded Knee creek. A small detachment which had been sent out to meet
    a supply train coming into the agency found the wagons drawn up in a square to resist an attack made by a band of
    about 50 Indians. The soldiers joined forces with the teamsters, and by firing from behind the protection of the
    wagons succeeded in driving off the Indians and killing a number of their horses. The hostiles were reinforced,
    however, and a hard skirmish was kept up for several hours until more troops arrived from the agency about dark,
    having been sent in answer to a courier who managed to elude the attacking party. The troops charged on a gallop and
    the Indians retreated, having lost several killed and wounded, besides a number of their horses. (<i><a href="#Colby">Colby</a>, 7.</i>)</p>

  <p>Amid all these warlike alarms the gentle muse Calliope hovered over the field and inspired W. H. Prather, a colored
    private of troop I of the Ninth cavalry, to the production of the ballad given below, one of the few good specimens
    of American ballad poetry, and worthy of equal place with “Captain Lovewell’s Fight,” “Old Quebec,” or anything that
    originated in the late rebellion. It became a favorite among the troops in camp and with the scattered frontiersmen
    of Dakota and Nebraska, being sung to a simple air with vigor and expression and a particularly rousing chorus, and
    is probably by this time a classic of the barracks. It is here reproduced verbatim from the printed slip published
    for distribution among the soldiers during the campaign.</p>

  <h3 class="nobreak" id="Appendix_XIII">APPENDIX—THE INDIAN STORY OF WOUNDED KNEE</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="hang">[<i>From the Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for 1891, volume 1, pages 179–181. Extracts from
      verbatim stenographic report of council held by delegations of Sioux with Commissioner of Indian Affairs, at
      Washington, February 11, 1891.</i>]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="smcap">Turning Hawk</span>, Pine Ridge (Mr Cook, interpreter). Mr Commissioner, my purpose to-day is
    to tell you what I know of the condition of affairs at the agency where I live. A certain falsehood came to our
    agency from the west which had the effect of a fire upon the Indians, and when this certain fire came upon our
    people those who had farsightedness and could see into the matter made up their minds to stand up against it and
    fight it. The reason we took this hostile attitude to this fire was because we believed that you yourself would not
    be in favor of this particular mischief-making thing; but just as we expected, the people in authority did not like
    this thing and we were quietly told that we must give up or have nothing to do with this certain movement. Though
    this is the advice from our good friends in the east, there were, of course, many silly young men who were longing
    to become identified with the movement, although they knew that there was nothing absolutely bad, nor did they know
    there was anything absolutely good, in connection with the movement.</p>

  <p>In the course of time we heard that the soldiers were moving toward the scene of trouble. After awhile some of the
    soldiers finally reached our place and we heard that a number of them also reached our friends at Rosebud. Of
    course, when a large body of soldiers is moving toward a certain direction they inspire a more or less amount of
    awe, and it is natural that the women and children who see this large moving mass are made afraid of it and be put
    in a condition to make them run away. At first we thought that Pine Ridge and Rosebud were the only two agencies
    where soldiers were sent, but finally we heard that the other agencies fared likewise. We heard and saw that about
    half our friends at Rosebud agency, from fear at seeing the soldiers, began the move of running away from their
    agency toward ours (Pine Ridge), and when they had gotten inside of our reservation they there learned that right
    ahead of them at our agency was another large crowd of soldiers, and while the soldiers were there, there was
    constantly a great deal of false rumor flying back and forth. The special rumor I have in mind is the threat that
    the soldiers had come there to disarm the Indians entirely and to take away all their horses from them. That was the
    oft-repeated story.</p>

  <p>So constantly repeated was this story that our friends from Rosebud, instead of going to Pine Ridge, the place of
    their destination, veered off and went to some other direction toward the “Bad Lands.” We did not know definitely
    how many, but understood there were 300 lodges of them, about 1,700 people. Eagle Pipe, Turning Bear, High Hawk,
    Short Bull, Lance, No Flesh, Pine Bird, Crow Dog, Two Strike, and White Horse were the leaders.</p>

  <p>Well, the people after veering off in this way, many of them who believe in peace and order at our agency, were
    very anxious that some influence should be brought upon these people. In addition to our love of peace we remembered
    that many of these people were related to us by blood. So we sent out peace commissioners to the people who were
    thus running away from their agency.</p>

  <p>I understood at the time that they were simply going away from fear because of so many soldiers. So constant was
    the word of these good men from Pine Ridge agency that finally they succeeded in getting away half of the party from
    Rosebud, from the place where they took refuge, and finally were brought to the agency at Pine Ridge.
    Young-Man-Afraid-of-his-Horses, Little Wound, Fast Thunder, Louis Shangreau, John Grass, Jack Red Cloud, and myself
    were some of these peace-makers.</p>

  <p>The remnant of the party from Rosebud not taken to the agency finally reached the wilds of the Bad Lands. Seeing
    that we had succeeded so well, once more we sent to the same party in the Bad Lands and succeeded in bringing these
    very Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_885">885</span> out of the depths of the Bad Lands and were being
    brought toward the agency. When we were about a day’s journey from our agency we heard that a certain party of
    Indians (Big Foot’s band) from the Cheyenne River agency was coming toward Pine Ridge in flight.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Captain Sword.</span> Those who actually went off of the Cheyenne River agency probably number
    303, and there were a few from the Standing Rook reserve with them, but as to their number I do not know. There were
    a number of Ogalallas, old men and several school boys, coming back with that very same party, and one of the very
    seriously wounded boys was a member of the Ogalalla boarding school at Pine Ridge agency. He was not on the warpath,
    but was simply returning home to his agency and to his school after a summer visit to relatives on the Cheyenne
    river.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Turning Hawk.</span> When we heard that these people were coming toward our agency we also
    heard this. These people were coming toward Pine Ridge agency, and when they were almost on the agency they were met
    by the soldiers and surrounded and finally taken to the Wounded Knee creek, and there at a given time their guns
    were demanded. When they had delivered them up, the men were separated from their families, from their tipis, and
    taken to a certain spot. When the guns were thus taken and the men thus separated, there was a crazy man, a young
    man of very bad influence and in fact a nobody, among that bunch of Indians fired his gun, and of course the firing
    of a gun must have been the breaking of a military rule of some sort, because immediately the soldiers returned fire
    and indiscriminate killing followed.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Spotted Horse.</span> This man shot an officer in the army; the first shot killed this officer.
    I was a voluntary scout at that encounter and I saw exactly what was done, and that was what I noticed; that the
    first shot killed an officer. As soon as this shot was fired the Indians immediately began drawing their knives, and
    they were exhorted from all sides to desist, but this was not obeyed. Consequently the firing began immediately on
    the part of the soldiers.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Turning Hawk.</span> All the men who were in a bunch were killed right there, and those who
    escaped that first fire got into the ravine, and as they went along up the ravine for a long distance they were
    pursued on both sides by the soldiers and shot down, as the dead bodies showed afterwards. The women were standing
    off at a different place from where the men were stationed, and when the firing began, those of the men who escaped
    the first onslaught went in one direction up the ravine, and then the women, who were bunched together at another
    place, went entirely in a different direction through an open field, and the women fared the same fate as the men
    who went up the deep ravine.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">American Horse.</span> The men were separated, as has already been said, from the women, and
    they were surrounded by the soldiers. Then came next the village of the Indians and that was entirely surrounded by
    the soldiers also. When the firing began, of course the people who were standing immediately around the young man
    who fired the first shot were killed right together, and then they turned their guns, Hotchkiss guns, etc., upon the
    women who were in the lodges standing there under a flag of truce, and of course as soon as they were fired upon
    they fled, the men fleeing in one direction and the women running in two different directions. So that there were
    three general directions in which they took flight.</p>

  <p>There was a women with an infant in her arms who was killed as she almost touched the flag of truce, and the women
    and children of course were strewn all along the circular village until they were dispatched. Right near the flag of
    truce a mother was shot down with her infant; the child not knowing that its mother was dead was still nursing, and
    that especially was a very sad sight. The women as they were fleeing with their babes were killed together, shot
    right through, and the women who were very heavy with child were also killed. All the Indians fled in these three
    directions, and after most all of them had been killed a cry was made that all those who were not killed or wounded
    should come forth and they would be safe. Little boys who were not wounded came out of their places of refuge,
    and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_886">886</span> as soon as they came in sight a number of soldiers surrounded
    them and butchered them there.</p>

  <p>Of course we all feel very sad about this affair. I stood very loyal to the government all through those
    troublesome days, and believing so much in the government and being so loyal to it, my disappointment was very
    strong, and I have come to Washington with a very great blame on my heart. Of course it would have been all right if
    only the men were killed; we would feel almost grateful for it. But the fact of the killing of the women, and more
    especially the killing of the young boys and girls who are to go to make up the future strength of the Indian
    people, is the saddest part of the whole affair and we feel it very sorely.</p>

  <p>I was not there at the time before the burial of the bodies, but I did go there with some of the police and the
    Indian doctor and a great many of the people, men from the agency, and we went through the battlefield and saw where
    the bodies were from the track of the blood.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Turning Hawk.</span> I had just reached the point where I said that the women were killed. We
    heard, besides the killing of the men, of the onslaught also made upon the women and children, and they were treated
    as roughly and indiscriminately as the men and boys were.</p>

  <p>Of course this affair brought a great deal of distress upon all the people, but especially upon the minds of those
    who stood loyal to the government and who did all that they were able to do in the matter of bringing about peace.
    They especially have suffered much distress and are very much hurt at heart. These peace-makers continued on in
    their good work, but there were a great many fickle young men who were ready to be moved by the change in the events
    there, and consequently, in spite of the great fire that was brought upon all, they were ready to assume any hostile
    attitude. These young men got themselves in readiness and went in the direction of the scene of battle so they might
    be of service there. They got there and finally exchanged shots with the soldiers. This party of young men was made
    up from Rosebud, Ogalalla (Pine Ridge), and members of any other agencies that happened to be there at the time.
    While this was going on in the neighborhood of Wounded Knee—the Indians and soldiers exchanging shots—the agency,
    our home, was also fired into by the Indians. Matters went on in this strain until the evening came on, and then the
    Indians went off down by White Clay creek. When the agency was fired upon by the Indians from the hillside, of
    course the shots were returned by the Indian police who were guarding the agency buildings.</p>

  <p>Although fighting seemed to have been in the air, yet those who believed in peace were still constant at their
    work. Young-Man-Afraid-of-his-Horses, who had been on a visit to some other agency in the north or northwest,
    returned, and immediately went out to the people living about White Clay creek, on the border of the Bad Lands, and
    brought his people out. He succeeded in obtaining the consent of the people to come out of their place of refuge and
    return to the agency. Thus the remaining portion of the Indians who started from Rosebud were brought back into the
    agency. Mr Commissioner, during the days of the great whirlwind out there, those good men tried to hold up a
    counteracting power, and that was “Peace.” We have now come to realize that peace has prevailed and won the day.
    While we were engaged in bringing about peace our property was left behind, of course, and most of us have lost
    everything, even down to the matter of guns with which to kill ducks, rabbits, etc, shotguns, and guns of that
    order. When Young-Man-Afraid brought the people in and their guns were asked for, both men who were called hostile
    and men who stood loyal to the government delivered up their guns.</p>

      CLOSE OF THE OUTBREAK—THE GHOST DANCE IN THE SOUTH</h2>
  </div>

  <p>In the meantime overtures of peace had been made by General Miles to the hostiles, most of whose leaders he knew
    personally, having received their surrender on the Yellowstone ten years before, at the close of the Custer war. On
    the urgent representations of himself and others Congress had also appropriated the necessary funds for carrying out
    the terms of the late treaty, by the disregard of which most of the trouble had been caused, so that the commander
    was now able to assure the Indians that their rights and necessities would receive attention. They were urged to
    come in and surrender, with a guaranty that the general himself would represent their case with the government. At
    the same time they were informed that retreat was cut off and that further resistance would be unavailing. As an
    additional step toward regaining their confidence, the civilian agents were removed from the several disturbed
    agencies, which were then put in charge of military officers well known and respected by the Indians. Cheyenne River
    agency was assigned to Captain J. H. Hurst, and Rosebud agency to Captain J. M. Lee, while Royer, at Pine Ridge, was
    superseded on January 8 by Captain. F. E. Pierce. The last-named officer was afterward relieved by Captain Charles
    G. Penney, who is now in charge. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 22; <a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 38; <a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 45.</i>)</p>

  <p>The friendly overtures made by General Miles, with evidences that the government desired to remedy their
    grievances, and that longer resistance was hopeless, had their effect on the hostiles. Little Wound,
    Young-man-afraid-of-his-horses (more properly, “Young-man-of-whose-horses-they-are-afraid”), Big Road, and other
    friendly chiefs, also used their persuasions with such good effect that by January 12 the whole body of nearly 4,000
    Indians had moved in to within sight of the agency and expressed their desire for peace. The troops closed in around
    them, and on the 16th of January, 1891, the hostiles surrendered, and the outbreak was at an end. They complied with
    every order and direction given by the commander, and gave up nearly 200 rifles, which, with other arms already
    surrendered, made a total of between 600 and 700 guns, more than had ever before been surrendered by the Sioux at
    one time. As a further guaranty of good faith, the commander demanded the surrender of Kicking Bear and Short Bull,
    the principal leaders, with about twenty other prominent warriors, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_888">
    888</span> hostages. The demand was readily complied with, and the men designated came forward voluntarily and
    gave themselves up as sureties for the good conduct of their people. They were sent to Fort Sheridan, Illinois, near
    Chicago, where they were kept until there was no further apprehension, and were then returned to their homes.
    (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 23; <a href="#Colby">Colby</a>, 8.</i>) After the surrender the late hostiles pitched their camp, numbering in all 742 tipis, in
    the bottom along White Clay creek, just west of the agency, where General Miles had supplies of beef, coffee, and
    sugar issued to them from the commissary department, and that night they enjoyed the first full meal they had known
    in several weeks.</p>

  <p>Thus ended the so-called Sioux outbreak of 1890–91. It might be better designated, however, as a Sioux panic and
    stampede, for, to quote the expressive letter of McGillycuddy, writing under date of January 15, 1891, “Up to date
    there has been neither a Sioux outbreak or war. No citizen in Nebraska or Dakota has been killed, molested, or can
    show the scratch of a pin, and no property has been destroyed off the reservation.” (<i><a href="#Colby">Colby</a>, 9.</i>) Only a single
    noncombatant was killed by the Indians, and that was close to the agency. The entire time occupied by the campaign,
    from the killing of Sitting Bull to the surrender at Pine Ridge, was only thirty-two days. The late hostiles were
    returned to their homes as speedily as possible. The Brulé of Rosebud, regarded as the most turbulent of the
    hostiles, were taken back to the agency by Captain Lee, for whom they had respect, founded on an acquaintance of
    several years’ standing, without escort and during the most intense cold of winter, but without any trouble or
    dissatisfaction whatever. The military were returned to their usual stations, and within a few weeks after the
    surrender affairs at the various agencies were moving again in the usual channel.</p>

  <p>An unfortunate event occurred just before the surrender in the killing of Lieutenant E. W. Casey of the
    Twenty-second infantry by Plenty Horses, a young Brulé, on January 7. Lieutenant Casey was in command of a troop of
    Cheyenne scouts, and was stationed at the mouth of White Clay creek, charged with the special duty of watching the
    hostile camp, which was located 8 miles farther up the creek at No Water’s place. On the day before his death
    several of the hostiles had visited him and held a friendly conference. The next morning, in company with two
    scouts, he went out avowedly for the purpose of observing the hostile camp more closely. He rode up to within a
    short distance of the camp, meeting and talking with several of the Indians on the way, and had stopped to talk with
    a half-blood relative of Red Cloud, when Plenty Horses, a short distance away, deliberately shot him through the
    head, and he fell from his horse dead. His body was not disturbed by the Indians, but was brought in by some of the
    Cheyenne scouts soon after. Plenty Horses was arraigned before a United States court, but was acquitted on the
    ground that as the Sioux were then at war and the officer was practically a spy upon the Indian camp, the act<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_889">889</span> was not murder in the legal sense of the word. Lieutenant Casey had
    been for a year in charge of the Cheyenne scouts and had taken great interest in their welfare and proficiency, and
    his death was greatly deplored by the Indians as the insane act of a boy overcome by the excitement of the times.
    (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 24; <a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 39; <a href="#Colby">Colby</a>, 10; <a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 46.</i>)</p>

  <p>On January 11 an unprovoked murder was committed on a small party of peaceable Indians on Belle Fourche, or North
    fork of Cheyenne river, by which the Indians who had come in to surrender were once more thrown into such alarm that
    for a time it seemed as if serious trouble might result. A party of Ogalala from Pine Ridge, consisting of Few
    Tails, a kindly, peaceable old man, with his wife, an old woman, and One Feather, with his wife and two children—one
    a girl about 13 years of age and the other an infant—had been hunting in the Black Hills under a pass from the
    agency. They had had a successful hunt, and were returning with their two wagons well loaded with meat, when they
    camped for the night at the mouth of Alkali creek. During the evening they were visited by some soldiers stopping at
    a ranch a few miles distant, who examined their pass and pronounced it all right. In the morning, after breakfast,
    the Indians started on again toward the agency, but had gone only a few hundred yards when they were fired upon by a
    party of white men concealed near the road. The leaders of the whites were three brothers named Culbertson, one of
    whom had but recently returned from the penitentiary. One of the murderers had visited the Indians in their camp the
    night before, and even that very morning. At the first fire Few Tails was killed, together with both ponies attached
    to the wagon. His wife jumped out and received two bullets, which brought her to the ground. The murderers rode past
    her, however, to get at the other Indian, who was coming up behind in the other wagon with his wife and two
    children. As soon as he saw his companion killed, One Feather turned his wagon in the other direction, and, telling
    his wife, who had also been shot, to drive on as fast as she could to save the children, he jumped upon one of the
    spare ponies and held off the murderers until his family had had time to make some distance. He then turned and
    joined his family and drove on for some 8 or 10 miles until the pursuers came up again, when he again turned and
    fought them off, while his wife went ahead with the wagon and the children. The wounded woman bravely drove on,
    while the two little children lay down in the wagon with their heads covered up in the blankets. As they drove they
    passed near a house, from which several other shots were fired at the flying mother, when her husband again rode up
    and kept off the whole party until the wagon could get ahead. Finally, as the ponies were tired out, this heroic man
    abandoned the wagon and put the two children on one of the spare ponies and his wounded wife and himself upon
    another and continued to retreat until the whites gave up the pursuit. He finally reached the agency with the wife
    and children.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_890">890</span></p>

  <p>The wife of Few Tails, after falling wounded by two bullets beside the wagon in which was her dead husband, lay
    helpless and probably unconscious upon the ground through all the long winter night until morning, when she revived,
    and finding one of the horses still alive, mounted it and managed by night to reach a settler’s house about 15 miles
    away. Instead of meeting help and sympathy, however, she was driven off by the two men there with loaded rifles, and
    leaving her horse in her fright, she hurried away as well as she could with a bullet in her leg and another in her
    breast, passing by the trail of One Feather’s wagon with the tracks of his pursuers fresh behind it, until she came
    near a trader’s store about 20 miles farther south. Afraid to go near it on account of her last experience, the poor
    woman circled around it, and continued, wounded, cold, and starving as she was, to travel by night and hide by day
    until she reached the Bad Lands. The rest may be told in her own words:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>After that I traveled every night, resting daytime, until I got here at the beef corral. Then I was very tired,
      and was near the military camp, and early in the morning a soldier came out and he shouted something back, and in
      a few minutes fifty men were there, and they got a blanket and took me to a tent. I had no blanket and my feet
      were swelled, and I was about ready to die. After I got to the tent a doctor came in—a soldier doctor, because he
      had straps on his shoulders—and washed me and treated me well.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A few of the soldiers camped near the scene of the attack had joined in the pursuit at the beginning, on the
    representations of some of the murderers, but abandoned it as soon as they found their mistake. According to all the
    testimony, the killing was a wanton, unprovoked, and deliberate murder, yet the criminals were acquitted in the
    local courts. The apathy displayed by the authorities of Meade county, South Dakota, in which the murder was
    committed, called forth some vigorous protests. Colonel Shafter, in his statement of the case, concludes, referring
    to the recent killing of Lieutenant Casey: “So long as Indians are being arrested and held for killing armed men
    under conditions of war, it seems to me that the white murderers of a part of a band of peaceful Indians should not
    be permitted to escape punishment.” The Indians took the same view of the case, and when General Miles demanded of
    Young-man-afraid-of-his-horses the surrender of the slayers of Casey and the herder Miller, the old chief
    indignantly replied: “No; I will not surrender them, but if you will bring the white men who killed Few Tails, I
    will bring the Indians who killed the white soldier and the herder; and right out here in front of your tipi I will
    have my young men shoot the Indians and you have your soldiers shoot the white men, and then we will be done with
    the whole business.”</p>

  <p>In regard to the heroic conduct of One Feather, the officer then in charge of the agency says: “The determination
    and genuine courage, as well as the generalship he manifested in keeping at a distance the six men who were pursuing
    him, and the devotion he showed toward his family, risking his life against great odds, designate him as entitled to
    a place on the list of heroes.” (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 25; <a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 40; <a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 47.</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_891">891</span></p>

  <p>On the recommendation of General Miles, a large delegation of the principal leaders of both friendly and hostile
    parties among the Sioux was allowed to visit Washington in February, 1891, to present their grievances and suggest
    remedies for dissatisfaction in the future. Among the principal speakers were: From Pine Ridge, American Horse,
    Captain George Sword, Big Road, and He Dog; from Rosebud, White Bird and Turning Hawk; from Cheyenne River, Little
    No Heart and Straight Head; from Standing Rock, John Grass and Mad Bear. The interpreters were Reverend C. S. Cook,
    David Zephier, Louis Primeau, Louis Richard, Clarence Three Stars, and Louis Shangreau. Their visit was eminently
    satisfactory and resulted in the inauguration of a more efficient administration of Sioux affairs for the future.
    Steps were taken to reimburse those whose ponies had been confiscated at the time of the Custer war in 1876, and
    additional appropriations were made for rations, so that before the end of the year the Indians were receiving half
    as much more as before the outbreak. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 26.</i>) On returning to their homes the Indians of the various Sioux
    agencies went to work in good faith putting in their crops and caring for their stock, and in a short time all
    further apprehension was at an end.</p>

  <p>The discussion of Indian affairs in connection with the outbreak led to the passage by Congress of a bill which
    enacted that all future vacancies in the office of Indian agent should be filled by military officers selected by
    the Indian office and detailed for the purpose from the army. At the same time a plan was originated to enlist
    Indians as a component part of the regular army. Small parties from various tribes had long been attached to various
    posts and commands in an irregular capacity as scouts. These bodies of scouts were now reduced in number or
    disbanded altogether, and in their stead were organized Indian troops or companies to be regularly attached to the
    different cavalry or infantry regiments. In the spring of 1891 officers were sent out to various western
    reservations, and succeeded in thus recruiting a number of regular troops from among the most warlike of the tribes,
    a considerable part of these coming from the late hostile Sioux.</p>

  <p>Although the campaign lasted only about a month the destruction of life was great, for an Indian war, and the money
    loss to the government and to individuals was something enormous. Three officers and 28 privates were killed or
    mortally wounded during the campaign, and 4 officers and 38 privates were less seriously wounded, several of these
    dying later on. (<i><a href="#War">War</a>, 27.</i>) The Indian loss can not be stated exactly. In the arrest of Sitting Bull there
    were killed or mortally wounded 8 of Sitting Bull’s party and 6 police, a total of 14. Those killed in the Wounded
    Knee fight, or who afterward died of wounds or exposure, numbered, according to the best estimates, at least 250.
    Those afterward killed in the various small skirmishes, including the Few Tails affair, may have numbered 20 or 30.
    In all, the campaign cost the lives of 49 whites and others on the government side and about 300 or more Indians.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_892">892</span></p>

  <p>The direct or incidental expenses of the campaign were as follows: Expenses of the Department of Justice for
    defending Plenty Horses and prosecuting the murderers of Few Tails, unknown; appropriation by Congress to reimburse
    Nebraska national guard for expense of service during the campaign, $43,000; paid out under act of Congress to
    reimburse friendly Indians and other legal residents on the reservations for property destroyed by hostiles,
    $97,646.85 (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 41</i>); extra expense of Commissary department of the army, $37,764.69; extra expense of the
    Medical department of the army, $1,164, besides extra supplies purchased by individuals; extra expenses of Ordnance
    department of the army, for ammunition, not accounted for; total extra expense of Quartermaster’s department of the
    army, $915,078.81, including $120,634.17 for transportation of troops over bonded railroads. (<i><a href="#AGO">A. G. O.</a>, 8.</i>)
    The total expense, public or private, was probably but little short of $1,200,000, or nearly $40,000 per day, a
    significant commentary on the bad policy of breaking faith with Indians.</p>

  <p>According to the report of the agency farmer sent out after the trouble to learn the extent of property of the
    friendly Indians destroyed by the hostiles on Pine Ridge agency, there were burned 53 Indian dwellings, 1 church, 2
    schoolhouses, and a bridge, all on White Clay creek, while nearly every remaining house along the creek had the
    windows broken out. A great deal of farming machinery and nearly all of the hay were burned, while stoves were
    broken to pieces and stock killed. A few of the friendly Indians had been so overcome by the excitement that they
    had burned their own houses and run their machinery down high hills into the river, where it was found frozen in the
    ice several months later. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 48.</i>)</p>

  <p>In view of the fact that only one noncombatant was killed and no depredations were committed off the reservation,
    the panic among the frontier settlers of both Dakotas, Nebraska, and Iowa was something ludicrous. The inhabitants
    worked themselves into such a high panic that ranches and even whole villages were temporarily abandoned and the
    people flocked into the railroad cities with vivid stories of murder, scalping, and desolation that had no
    foundation whatever in fact. A reliable authority who was on the ground shortly after the scare had subsided gives
    this characteristic instance among others:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In another city, a place of 3,000 inhabitants, 75 miles from any Indians and 150 miles from any hostiles, word
      came about 2 o’clock Sunday morning for the militia to be in readiness. The company promptly assembled, were
      instructed and drilled. In an evening church service one of the pastors broke out in prayer: “O Lord, prepare us
      for what awaits us. We have just been listening to the sweet sounds of praise, but ere the morning sun we may hear
      the war whoop of the red man.” The effect on children and nervous persons may be imagined. The legislature was in
      session and the impression upon that body was such as to lead it to make an appropriation for the benefit of the
      state militia at the expense of one to the state agricultural fair. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 42.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The crisis produced the usual crop of patriots, all ready to serve their country—usually for a consideration. Among
    these was a lady of Utica,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_893">893</span> New York, claiming to be of the
    renowned Iroquois blood, and styling herself the “Doctor Princess Viroqua,” who, with her sister “Wynima,” wrote to
    the Indian Office for a commission to go out to try the effect of moral suasion on the belligerent Sioux,
    representing that by virtue of her descent from a long line of aboriginal princes she would be welcomed with
    enthusiasm and accomplish her mission of peace. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 49.</i>) As a matter of fact, neither of the names
    Viroqua or Wynima could be pronounced by a genuine Iroquois knowing only his own tongue, and the second one, Wynima,
    is borrowed from Meacham’s sensational history of the Modoc war in California.</p>

  <p>The proprietor of a “wild west” show in New York, signing himself Texas Ben, wrote also volunteering his services
    and submitting as credentials his museum letter-head, stating that he had served with Quantrell, and had the written
    indorsement of Cole Younger. An old veteran of the Iowa soldiers’ home wrote to Secretary Noble, with a redundance
    of capitals and much bad spelling, offering his help against the hostiles, saying that he had been “RAZeD” among
    them and could “ToLK The TUN” and was ready to “Do eneThin FoR mY CuntRY.” (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 50.</i>)</p>

  <p>A band of patriots in Minnesota, whose early education appears to have been somewhat neglected, wrote to the
    Secretary of the Interior offering to organize a company of 50 men to put down the outbreak, provided the government
    would look after a few items which they enumerated: “The government to Furnish us with Two good Horses Each a good
    Winchester Rifle, Two good Cotes Revolvers and give us $300.00 Bounty and say a Salary of Fifty Per Month, Each and
    our own judgment and we will settel this Indian question For Ever, and Rations and Ammunition. We Should Have in
    addition to this say Five dollars a Head.” (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 51.</i>)</p>

  <p>A man named Albert Hopkins appeared at Pine Ridge in December, 1890, wearing a blanket and claiming to be the
    Indian messiah, and announced his intention of going alone into the Bad Lands to the Indians, who were expecting his
    arrival, with the “Pansy Banner of Peace.” His claims were ridiculed by Red Cloud and others, and he was promptly
    arrested and put off the reservation. However, he was not dead, but only sleeping, and on March, 1893, having come
    to Washington, he addressed an urgent letter to Secretary Noble requesting official authority to visit the Sioux
    reservations and to preach to the Indians, stating that “with the help of the Pansy and its motto and manifest
    teaching, ‘Union, Culture, and Peace,’ and the star-pansy banner, of which I inclose an illustration, I hope to
    establish the permanent peace of the border.” He signs himself “Albert C. Hopkins, Pres. Pro. tem. The Pansy Society
    of America.”</p>

  <p>The letter was referred to the Indian Office, which refused permission. This brought a reply from Hopkins, who this
    time signs himself “The Indian Messiah,” in which he states that as the Indians were expecting the messiah in the
    spring, “in accordance with the prophecy of Sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_894">894</span> Bull,” it was
    necessary that he should go to them at once, so that they might “accept the teaching of the pansy and its motto,
    which now they only partially or very doubtfully accept.”</p>

  <p>Receiving no answer, he wrote again about the end of March, both to the Secretary and to the Indian Commissioner,
    stating that messiahs, being human, were subject to human limitations, of which fact the Indians were well aware,
    but warning these officials that if these limitations were set by the government it would be held responsible for
    his nonappearance to the Indians, as he had promised, “before the native pansies blossom on the prairies.” He ends
    by stating that he would leave on Easter Sunday for the Sioux country, but as nothing was heard of him later, it is
    presumed that he succumbed to the limitations. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 52.</i>)</p>

  <p class="p2">The first direct knowledge of the messiah and the Ghost dance came to the northern Arapaho in Wyoming, through
    Nakash, “Sage,” who, with several Shoshoni, visited the messiah in the early spring of 1889, and on his return
    brought back to his people the first songs of the dance, these being probably some of the original Paiute songs of
    the messiah himself. The Ghost dance was at once inaugurated among the Shoshoni and northern Arapaho. In the summer
    of the same year the first rumors of the new redeemer reached the southern Arapaho and Cheyenne in Oklahoma, through
    the medium of letters written by returned pupils of eastern government schools.</p>

  <p>Fresh reports of wonderful things beyond the mountains were constantly coming to the northern prairie tribes, and
    the excitement grew until the close of the year 1889, when a large delegation, including Sioux, northern Cheyenne,
    and northern Arapaho, crossed the mountains to the Paiute country to see and talk with the messiah. Among the Sioux
    delegates were Short Bull, Fire Thunder, and Kicking Bear, as already stated. Among the Cheyenne were Porcupine and
    several others, including one woman. The Arapaho representatives were Sitting Bull (Hänä′chä-thi′ăk) and Friday. The
    delegates from the different tribes met at Wind River reservation, in Wyoming, which they left about Christmas, and
    after stopping a short time among the Bannock and Shoshoni at Fort Hall, went on to Walker lake, in Nevada. They
    were gone some time and returned to Wyoming in March of 1890, the Sioux and Cheyenne continuing on to their homes
    farther east. According to the statement of Nakash they had a five days’ conference with the messiah, who at one
    time went into a trance, but his visitors did not.</p>

  <p>Before their return the southern Arapaho, in Oklahoma, had sent up Wa′tän-ga′a, “Black Coyote,” an officer of the
    Indian police, and Washee, a scout at Fort Reno, to their relatives in Wyoming to learn definitely as to the truth
    or falsity of the rumors. Washee went on to Fort Hall, where his faith failed him, and he came back with the report
    that the messiah was only a half-blood. This was not correct, but Washee himself afterward acknowledged that he had
    based his report <span class="pagenum" id="Page_895">895</span>on hearsay. Black Coyote remained until the
    other delegates returned from the Paiute country with the announcement that all that had been said of the messiah
    and the advent of a new earth was true. He listened eagerly to all they had to tell, took part with the rest in the
    dance, learned the songs, and returned in April, 1890, and inaugurated the first Ghost dance in the south among the
    Arapaho.</p>

    <figcaption class="xsmall">ARAPAHO GHOST SHIRT SHOWING COLORING</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The Cheyenne, being skeptical by nature, were unwilling to trust entirely to the report of Black Coyote and so sent
    up two delegates of their own, Little Chief and Bark, to investigate the story in the north. Somewhat later White
    Shield, another Cheyenne, went up alone on the same errand. Their report being favorable, the Cheyenne also took up
    the Ghost dance in the summer of 1890. They never went into it with the same fervor, however, and although they had
    their separate dance with songs in their own language, they more commonly danced together with the Arapaho and sang
    with them the Arapaho songs. For several years the old Indian dances had been nearly obsolete with these tribes, but
    as the new religion meant a revival of the Indian idea they soon became common again, with the exception of the war
    dance and others of that kind which were strictly prohibited by the messiah.</p>

  <p>From this time the Ghost dance grew in fervor and frequency among the Arapaho and Cheyenne. In almost every camp
    the dance would be held two or three times a week, beginning about sunset and often continuing until daylight. The
    excitement reached fever heat in September, 1890, when Sitting Bull came down from the northern Arapaho to instruct
    the southern tribes in the doctrine and ceremony.</p>

  <p>At a great Ghost dance held on South Canadian river, about 2 miles below the agency at Darlington, Oklahoma, it was
    estimated that 3,000 Indians were present, including nearly all of the Arapaho and Cheyenne, with a number of Caddo,
    Wichita, Kiowa, and others. The first trances of the Ghost dance among the southern tribes occurred at this time
    through the medium of Sitting Bull. One informant states that a leader named Howling Bull had produced trances at a
    dance on the Washita some time before, but the statement lacks confirmation.</p>

  <p>As Sitting Bull was the great apostle of the Ghost dance among the southern tribes, being regarded almost in the
    same light as the messiah himself, he merits special notice. He is now about 42 years of age and at the beginning of
    his apostleship in 1890 was but 36. He is a full-blood Arapaho, although rather light in complexion and color of
    eyes, and speaks only his native language, but converses with ease in the universal sign language of the plains. It
    was chiefly by means of this sign language that he instructed his disciples among the Caddo, Wichita, and Kiowa. He
    is about 5 feet 8 inches tall, dignified but plain in his bearing, and with a particularly winning smile. His power
    over those with whom he comes in contact is evident from the report of Lieutenant (now Captain) Scott, who had been
    ordered by the War Department to investigate the Ghost dance, and who for weeks had<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_896">896</span> been denouncing him as a humbug, but who, on finally meeting him for the first time,
    declares that the opinion formed before seeing him began to change in his favor almost immediately. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>,
    53.</i>) In conversation with the author Sitting Bull stated that he was originally a southern Arapaho, but went
    up to live with the northern branch of the tribe, in Wyoming, about 1876. When a boy in the south he was known as
    Bítäye, “Captor,” but on reaching manhood his name was changed, in conformity with a common Indian custom, to
    Hänä′chä-thi′ăk, “Sitting Bull.” On returning to the south, after having visited the messiah, he found his brother
    known under the same name, and to avoid confusion the brother then adopted the name of Scabby Bull, by which he is
    now known. It should be mentioned that an Indian “brother” may be only a cousin, as no distinction is made in the
    Indian system. On removing to the south he fixed his abode near Cantonment, Oklahoma, where he now resides.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 83</span>—Sitting Bull the Arapaho apostle.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>With regard to the reverence in which he was held by his disciples at this time, and of his own sincerity, Captain
    Scott says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It was very difficult to get an opportunity to talk with him quietly on account of the persistent manner in which
      he was followed about. All sorts of people wanted to touch him, men and women would come in, rub their hands on
      him, and cry, which demonstration he received with a patient fortitude that was rather ludicrous at times. While
      he by no means told us everything he knew, it was easy to believe that he was not the rank impostor that I had
      before considered him. He makes no demands for presents while at these camps. This trip entailed a ride of 200
      miles in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_897">897</span>the winter season, at the request of the Wichitas, for
      which I understand they paid him $50 before starting, but everything that was given him while at this camp was a
      voluntary gift, prompted entirely by the good wishes of the giver. He took but little property away when he left,
      and I saw but one horse that I thought he had not brought down with him.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Upon being asked concerning his religion, he said that all I had heard must not be attributed to him, as some of
      it was false; that he does not believe that he saw the veritable “Jesus” alive in the north, but he did see a man
      there whom “Jesus” had helped or inspired. This person told him that if he persevered in the dance it would cause
      sickness and death to disappear. He avoided some of the questions about the coming of the buffalo, etc., and under
      the circumstances it was not possible to draw him out further, and the subject of religion was then dropped, with
      the intention of taking it up at a more favorable time, but this time never came. A great many of the doings seen
      at these dances are the afterthoughts of all kinds of people. I have seen some of them arise and have watched
      their growth. These are not the teachings of Sitting Bull, although he refrains from interfering with them through
      policy. He took no part in the humbuggery going on, but danced and sang like the humblest individual there. These
      things, taken in connection with Äpiatañ’s letter, would make it seem that Sitting Bull has been a dupe himself
      partly, and there is a possibility that he is largely sincere in his teachings. There is this to be said in his
      favor, that he has given these people a better religion than they ever had before, taught them precepts which if
      faithfully carried out will bring them into better accord with their white neighbors, and has prepared the way for
      their final Christianization. For this he is entitled to no little credit. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 54.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He made no claim to be a regular medicine-man, and so far as known never went into a trance himself. Since the
    failure of his predictions, especially with regard to the recovery of the ceded reservation, he has fallen from his
    high estate. Truth compels us also to state that, in spite of his apostolic character, he is about as uncertain in
    his movements as the average Indian.</p>

  <p>After Sitting Bull, the principal leader of the Ghost dance among the southern Arapaho is Wa′tän-ga′a or Black
    Coyote, from whom the town of Watonga, in Canadian county, derives its name. Black Coyote is a man of considerable
    importance both in his tribe and in his own estimation, and aspires to be a leader in anything that concerns his
    people. With a natural predisposition to religions things, it is the dream of his life to be a great priest and
    medicine-man. At the same time he keeps a sharp lookout for his temporal affairs, and has managed to accumulate
    considerable property in wagons and livestock, including three wives. Although still a young man, being but little
    more than 40 years of age, he has had his share of the world’s honors, being not only a leader in the Ghost dance
    and other Indian ceremonies, tribal delegate to Washington, and captain of the Indian police, but also, in his new
    character of an American citizen, deputy sheriff of Canadian county. He is a good-natured fellow, and vain of his
    possessions and titles, but at the same time thoroughly loyal and reliable in the discharge of his duties, and
    always ready to execute his orders at whatever personal risk. His priestly ambition led him to make the journey to
    the north, in which he brought back the first songs of the Ghost dance, and thus became a leader, and a year later
    he headed a delegation from Oklahoma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_898">898</span> to the messiah of Walker
    lake. He has repeatedly asked me to get for him a permanent license from the government to enable him to visit the
    various reservations at will as a general evangel of Indian medicine and ceremony. Black Coyote in full uniform,
    with official badge, a Harrison medal, and an immense police overcoat, which he procured in Washington, and riding
    with his three wives in his own double-seated coach, is a spectacle magnificent and impressive. Black Coyote in
    breechcloth, paint, and feathers, leading the Ghost dance, or sitting flat on the ground and beating the earth with
    his hand in excess of religious fervor, is equally impressive. It was this combination of vanity of leadership and
    sense of duty as a government officer that made him my first and most willing informant on the Ghost dance, and
    enabled me through him to do so much with the Arapaho.</p>

  <p>In his portrait (<a href="#plate_cv">plate <span class="smcap">cv</span></a>) a number of scars will be noticed on his chest and arms.
    The full number of these scars is seventy, arranged in various patterns of lines, circles, crosses, etc., with a
    long figure of the sacred pipe on one arm. According to his own statement they were made in obedience to a dream as
    a sacrifice to save the lives of his children. Several of his children had died in rapid succession, and in
    accordance with Indian custom he undertook a fast of four days as an expiation to the overruling spirit. During this
    time, while lying on his bed, he heard a voice, somewhat resembling the cry of an owl or the subdued bark of a dog.
    The voice told him that if he wished to save his other children he must cut out seventy pieces of skin and offer
    them to the sun. He at once cut out seven pieces, held them out to the sun and prayed, and then buried them. But the
    sun was not satisfied, and soon after he was warned in a vision that the full number of seventy must be sacrificed
    if he would save his children. He then did as directed, cutting out the pieces of skin in the various patterns
    indicated, offering each in turn to the sun with a prayer for the health of his family, and then burying them. Since
    then there has been no death in his family. In cutting out the larger pieces, some of which were several inches long
    and nearly half an inch wide, the skin was first lifted up with an awl and then sliced away with a knife. This had
    to be done by an assistant, and Black Coyote was particular to show me by signs, sitting very erect and bracing
    himself firmly, that he had not flinched during the process.</p>

  <p>As has been stated, the first trances in the southern Ghost dance occurred at the great dance held near the
    Cheyenne and Arapaho agency under the auspices of Sitting Bull in September, 1890. On this occasion Cheyenne and
    Arapaho, Caddo, Wichita, Kiowa, and Apache to the number of perhaps 3,000 assembled, and remained together for about
    two weeks, dancing every night until daylight. This was the largest Ghost dance ever held in the south. After dances
    had been held for two or three nights Sitting Bull announced that at the next one he would perform a great wonder in
    the sight of all the people, after <span class="pagenum" id="Page_899">899</span>which they would be able to
    make songs for themselves. He said no more, but dismissed them to their tipis, wondering what this miracle could be.
    On the next night he appeared wearing a wide-brim hat with a single eagle feather, the same hat in which he is
    generally seen. Nearly all of the two tribes of Cheyenne and Arapaho were present, and probably 600 or 800 were in
    the dance circle at one time. Nothing unusual occurred for several hours until the dancers had gradually worked
    themselves up to a high state of excitement, when Sitting Bull stepped into the circle, and going up close in front
    of a young Arapaho woman, he began to make hypnotic passes before her face with the eagle feather. In a few seconds
    she became rigid and then fell to the ground unconscious. Sitting Bull then turned his attention to another and
    another, and the same thing happened to each in turn until nearly a hundred were stretched out on the ground at
    once. As usual in the trances some lay thus for a long time, and others recovered sooner, but none were disturbed,
    as Sitting Bull told the dancers that these were now beholding happy visions of the spirit world. When next they
    came together those who had been in the trance related their experiences in the other world, how they had met and
    talked with their departed friends and joined in their oldtime amusements. Many of them embodied their visions in
    songs, which were sung that night and afterward in the dance, and from that time the Ghost dance was naturalized in
    the south and developed rapidly along new lines. Each succeeding dance resulted in other visions and new songs, and
    from time to time other hypnotists arose, until almost every camp had its own.</p>

  <p>About this time a commission arrived to treat with the Cheyenne and Arapaho for the sale of their reservation. The
    Indians were much divided in opinion, the great majority opposing any sale whatsoever, even of their claim in the
    Cherokee strip, which they believed was all that the agreement was intended to cover. While the debate was in
    progress Left Hand, chief of the Arapaho, went to Sitting Bull and asked his opinion on the matter. Sitting Bull
    advised him to sell for what they could get, as they had need of the money, and in a short time the messiah would
    come and restore the land to them. On this advice Left Hand signed the agreement, in the face of threats from those
    opposed to it, and his example was followed by nearly all of his tribe. This incident shows how thoroughly Sitting
    Bull and the other Arapaho believed in the new doctrine. In view of the misery that has come on these tribes from
    the sale of their reservation, it is sad to think that they could have so deceived themselves by false hopes of
    divine interposition. A large party of the Cheyenne refused to have anything to do with the sale or to countenance
    the transaction by accepting their share of the purchase money, even after the whites had taken possession of the
    lands.</p>

  <p>The troubles in the Sioux country now began to attract public attention, and there was suggestion of military
    interference. The newspaper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_900">900</span> liar has reached an abnormal
    development in Oklahoma, and dispatches from Guthrie, El Reno, and Oklahoma City were filled with vivid accounts of
    war dances, scalping parties, and imminent outbreaks, mingled with frantic appeals for troops. A specimen dispatch
    stated that a thousand Kickapoo were dancing, whereas in fact the whole tribe numbers only 325, very few of whom
    were in any way concerned with the Ghost dance. Indian Commissioner Morgan was at this time (November, 1890) on a
    tour of inspection among the western tribes of Oklahoma, and satisfied himself that all such sensational reports
    were false, and that there was no danger to be apprehended from the dance. (<i><a href="#Ghost_Dance">G. D.</a>, 55.</i>) At the same time the
    War Department commissioned Lieutenant (now Captain) H. L. Scott, of the Seventh cavalry, then and now stationed at
    Fort Sill, Oklahoma, to investigate the meaning of the excitement and the possibility of an outbreak. Captain Scott
    was eminently fitted for the work by his intimate acquaintance with the Indians and his perfect knowledge of the
    sign language. In the course of December, 1890, and January and February, 1891, he visited the various camps of the
    western tribes of the territory, attended a number of dances, and talked with the leaders. His reports on the Ghost
    dance are most valuable, and confirmed the War Department in its previous opinion that no danger was to be
    apprehended, and that the true policy was one of noninterference.</p>

  <p>The dance constantly gathered strength among the Arapaho and Cheyenne, in spite of the failure of the first
    prediction, and spread rapidly to the neighboring tribes, Sitting Bull himself being the high priest and chief
    propagandist. The adverse report brought back by Ä′piatañ, the Kiowa, in the spring of 1891 had no effect outside of
    his own tribe. In the early part of that year the Arapaho and Cheyenne sent a delegation, including one woman, to
    visit the messiah in Nevada and bring back the latest news from heaven. They were gone a considerable time and
    returned with some of the sacred medicine paint given them by Wovoka, after having taken part with the Paiute in a
    Ghost dance under his leadership at the regular dance ground near Mason valley. Tall Bull, captain of the Cheyenne
    police, was one of this party, and Arnold Woolworth, a Carlisle student, acted as interpreter.</p>

  <p>In August, 1891, another delegation went out, consisting of Black Coyote, Little Raven, Red Wolf, Grant Left Hand,
    and Casper Edson (Arapaho), and Black Sharp Nose and Standing Bull (Cheyenne). Grant Left Hand and Casper Edson,
    Carlisle students, acted as interpreters, wrote down the words of the messiah, and delivered his message to their
    people on their return. This message, as written down at the time by Casper Edson, is given in the preceding chapter
    on the doctrine of the Ghost dance. In accord with the messiah’s instructions the two tribes now changed their
    manner of dancing from frequent small dances at each camp at irregular intervals to larger dances participated in by
    several camps together at regular intervals of six weeks, each dance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_901">
    901</span> continuing for five consecutive days. The Caddo and Wichita also adopted the new rule in agreement
    with instructions brought back by a delegation sent out about the same time. The change was opposed by Sitting Bull
    and some others, but the delegates, having the authority of the messiah for the innovation, succeeded in carrying
    their point, and thereafter assumed a leadership on equal terms with Sitting Bull, who from that time lost much of
    his interest in the dance. They were gone about two weeks, and brought back with them a quantity of the sacred paint
    and a large number of magpie feathers, the kind commonly worn by the Paiute in the Ghost dance. This started a
    demand for magpie feathers, and the shrewd traders soon turned the fact to their own advantage by importing selected
    crow feathers, which they sold to the unsuspecting Indians for the genuine article at the rate of two feathers for a
    quarter. While in the land of the Paiute the delegates took part in the Ghost dance at Mason valley, and were thrown
    into a trance by Wovoka, as related in <a href="#Chapter_IX">chapter <span class="smcap">ix</span></a>.</p>

  <p>The Ghost dance practically superseded all other dances among the Cheyenne and Arapaho, and constantly developed
    new features, notably the auxiliary “crow dance,” which was organized by Grant Left Hand. This was claimed as a
    dance seen in a trance vision of the spirit world, but is really only a modification of the “Omaha dance,” common to
    the northern prairie tribes. The opening of the reservation and the influx of the whites served to intensify the
    religious fervor of the Indians, who were now more than ever made to feel their dependent and helpless condition. It
    was impossible, however, that the intense mental strain could endure forever, and after the failure of the
    predictions on the appointed dates the wild excitement gradually cooled and crystallized into a fixed but tranquil
    expectation of ultimate happiness under the old conditions in another world.</p>

  <p>In October, 1892, another delegation, consisting of Sitting Bull and his wife, with Washee and two other Arapaho,
    and Edward Guerrier, a half-blood Cheyenne, visited the messiah. They brought back a very discouraging report, which
    was in substance that the messiah was tired of so many visitors and wanted them to go home and tell their tribes to
    stop dancing. Although the Indians generally refused to accept the message as genuine, the effect was naturally
    depressing. A year later, in October, 1893, Black Coyote and several others dictated through me a letter to Wovoka,
    asking him to send them some of the sacred paint or anything else that would make them think of him, with “some good
    words to help us and our children,” and requesting to know whether he had been truthfully reported by the delegates
    of the preceding year. To one who knows these people their simple religious faith is too touching to be a subject of
    amusement.</p>

  <p class="p2">The messiah doctrine never gained many converts among the Comanche, excepting those of the Penätĕ′ka division and a
    few others living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_902">902</span> on the Little Washita and other streams on the
    northern boundary of the reservation, adjoining the tribes most interested in the Ghost dance. These Comanche held a
    few Ghost dances and made a few songs, but the body of the tribe would have nothing to do with it. This lack of
    interest was due partly to the general skeptical temperament of the Comanche, evinced in their carelessness in
    regard to ceremonial forms, and partly to their tribal pride, which forbade their following after the strange gods
    of another people, as they considered their own mescal rite sufficient to all their needs. Quanah Parker, their head
    chief, a shrewd half-blood, opposed the new doctrine and prevented its spread among his tribe.</p>

  <p class="p2">The Ghost dance was brought to the Pawnee, Ponca, Oto, Missouri, Kansa, Iowa, Osage, and other tribes in central
    Oklahoma by delegates from the Arapaho and Cheyenne in the west. The doctrine made slow progress for some time, but
    by February, 1892, the majority of the Pawnee were dancing in confident expectation of the speedy coming of the
    messiah and the buffalo. Of all these tribes the Pawnee took most interest in the new doctrine, becoming as much
    devoted to the Ghost dance as the Arapaho themselves. The leader among the Pawnee was Frank White, and among the Oto
    was Buffalo Black. The agent in charge took stringent measures against the dance, and had the Oto prophet arrested
    and confined in the Wichita jail, threatening at the same time to cut off supplies from the tribe. As the
    confederated Oto and Missouri number only 362 in all, they were easily brought into subjection, and the dance was
    abandoned. The same method was pursued with the Pawnee prophet and his people, but as they are stronger in number
    than the Oto, they were proportionately harder to deal with, but the final result was the same. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 43.</i>)
    The Osage gave but little heed to the story, perhaps from the fact that, as they are the wealthiest tribe in the
    country, they feel no such urgent need of a redeemer as their less fortunate brethren. The Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo, and
    Potawatomi engaged in the dance only to a limited extent, for the reason that a number of the natives of these
    tribes, particularly the Potawatomi, are under Catholic influences, while most of the others adhere to the doctrine
    of Känakûk, the Potawatomi prophet mentioned in <a href="#Chapter_V">chapter <span class="smcap">v</span></a>.</p>

  <p class="p2">The Ghost dance doctrine was communicated directly to the Caddo, Wichita, Kichai, Delaware, and Kiowa by the
    Arapaho and Cheyenne, their neighbors on the north. We shall speak now of the tribes first mentioned, leaving the
    Kiowa until the last. The Caddo, Wichita, Kichai, and several remnants of cognate tribes, with a small band of the
    Delaware, numbering in all about a thousand Indians, occupy a reservation between the Washita and the South Canadian
    in western Oklahoma, having the Arapaho and Cheyenne on the north and west, the Kiowa on the south, and the whites
    of Oklahoma and the Chickasaw nation on the east. The Caddo are the leading tribe, numbering<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_903">903</span> more than half of the whole body. They were the first of these to take up the dance,
    and have manifested the greatest interest in it from the time it was introduced among them.</p>

  <p>A number of Caddo first attended the great Ghost dance held by the Cheyenne and Arapaho on the South Canadian in
    the fall of 1890 on the occasion when Sitting Bull came down from the north and inaugurated the trances. On
    returning to their homes they started the Ghost dance, which they kept up, singing the Arapaho songs as they had
    heard them on the Canadian, until Sitting Bull came down about December, 1890, to give them further instruction in
    the doctrine and to “give the feather” to the seven persons selected to lead the ceremony. From this time the Caddo
    had songs and trances of their own, the chief priest and hypnotist of the dance being Nĭshkû′ntŭ, “Moon Head,” or
    John Wilson. The Caddo and the Delaware usually danced together on Boggy Creek. The Wichita and the Kichai, who took
    the doctrine from the Caddo, usually danced together on Sugar creek about 15 miles from the agency at Anadarko, but
    manifested less interest in the matter until Sitting Bull came down about the beginning of February, 1891, and “gave
    the feather” to the leaders. From this time all these tribes went into the dance heart and soul, on some occasions
    dancing for days and nights together from the middle of the afternoon until the sun was well up in the morning. The
    usual custom was to continue until about midnight. Cold weather had no deterrent effect, and they kept up the dance
    in the snow, the trance subjects sometimes lying unconscious in the snow for half an hour at a time. At this time it
    was confidently expected that the great change would occur in the spring, and as the time drew near the excitement
    became most intense. The return of the Kiowa delegate, Ä′piatañ, in the middle of February, 1891, with a report
    adverse to the messiah, produced no effect on the Caddo and their confederates, who refused to put any faith in his
    statements, claiming that he had not seen the real messiah or else had been bribed by the whites to make a false
    report.</p>

  <p>About the time that Black Coyote and the others went out to see the messiah in the fall of 1891 the Caddo and their
    confederates sent out a delegation for the same purpose. The delegates were Billy Wilson and Squirrel (Caddo),
    Nashtowi and Lawrie Tatum (Wichita), and Jack Harry (Delaware). Tatum was a schoolboy and acted as interpreter for
    the party. Like the Arapaho they came back impressed with reverence for the messiah, and at once changed the time
    and method of the dancing, in accordance with his instructions, to periodical dances at intervals of six weeks,
    continuing for five consecutive days, the dance on the last night being kept up until daylight, when all the
    participants went down to bathe in the stream and then dispersed to their homes. They were dancing in this fashion
    when last visited in the fall of 1893.</p>

  <p>The principal leader of the Ghost dance among the Caddo is Nĭshkû′ntŭ, “Moon Head,” known to the whites as John
    Wilson. Although considered a Caddo, and speaking only that language, he is very much<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_904">904</span> of a mixture, being half Delaware, one-fourth Caddo, and one-fourth French. One of
    his grandfathers was a Frenchman. As the Caddo lived originally in Louisiana, there is a considerable mixture of
    French blood among them, which manifests itself in his case in a fairly heavy beard. He is about 50 years of age,
    rather tall and well built, and wears his hair at full length flowing loosely over his shoulders. With a good head
    and strong, intelligent features, he presents the appearance of a natural leader. He is also prominent in the mescal
    rite, which has recently come to his tribe from the Kiowa and Comanche. He was one of the first Caddo to go into a
    trance, the occasion being the great Ghost dance held by the Arapaho and Cheyenne near Darlington agency, at which
    Sitting Bull presided, in the fall of 1890. On his return to consciousness he had wonderful things to tell of his
    experiences in the spirit world, composed a new song, and from that time became the high priest of the Caddo dance.
    Since then his trances have been frequent, both in and out of the Ghost dance, and in addition to his leadership in
    this connection he assumes the occult powers and authority of a great medicine-man, all the powers claimed by him
    being freely conceded by his people.</p>

  <p>When Captain Scott was investigating the Ghost dance among the Caddo and other tribes of that section, at the
    period of greatest excitement, in the winter of 1890–91, he met Wilson, of whom he has this to say:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>John Wilson, a Caddo man of much prominence, was especially affected, performing a series of gyrations that were
      most remarkable. At all hours of the day and night his cry could be heard all over camp, and when found he would
      be dancing in the ring, possibly upon one foot, with his eyes closed and the forefinger of his right hand pointed
      upward, or in some other ridiculous posture. Upon being asked his reasons for assuming these attitudes he replied
      that he could not help it; that it came over him just like cramps.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Somewhat later Captain Scott says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>John Wilson had progressed finely, and was now a full-fledged doctor, a healer of diseases, and a finder of
      stolen property through supernatural means. One day, while we were in his tent, a Wichita woman entered, led by
      the spirit. It was explained to us that she did not even know who lived there, but some force she could not
      account for brought her. Having stated her case to John, he went off into a fit of the jerks, in which his spirit
      went up and saw “his father” [i.&nbsp;e., God], who directed him how to cure this woman. When he came to, he explained
      the cure to her, and sent her away rejoicing. Soon afterwards a Keechei man came in, who was blind of one eye, and
      who desired to have the vision restored. John again consulted his father, who informed him that nothing could be
      done for that eye because that man held aloof from the dance.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>While the author was visiting the Caddo on Sugar creek in the fall of 1893, John Wilson came down from his own camp
    to explain his part in the Ghost dance. He wore a wide-brim hat, with his hair flowing down to his shoulders, and on
    his breast, suspended from a cord about his neck, was a curious amulet consisting of the polished end of a buffalo
    horn, surrounded by a circlet of downy red feathers, within another circle of badger and owl claws. He explained
    that this was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_905">905</span> source of his prophetic and clairvoyant
    inspiration. The buffalo horn was “God’s heart,” the red feathers contained his own heart, and the circle of claws
    represented the world. When he prayed for help, his heart communed with “God’s heart,” and he learned what he wished
    to know. He had much to say also of the moon. Sometimes in his trances he went to the moon and the moon taught him
    secrets. It must be remembered that sun, moon, stars, and almost every other thing in nature are considered by the
    Indians as endowed with life and spirit. He claimed an intimate acquaintance with the other world and asserted
    positively that he could tell me “just what heaven is like.” Another man who accompanied him had a yellow sun with
    green rays painted on his forehead, with an elaborate rayed crescent in green, red, and yellow on his chin, and wore
    a necklace from which depended a crucifix and a brass clock-wheel, the latter, as he stated, representing the sun.</p>

  <p>On entering the room where I sat awaiting him, Nĭshkû′ntŭ approached and performed mystic passes in front of my
    face with his hands, after the manner of the hypnotist priests in the Ghost dance, blowing upon me the while, as he
    afterward explained to blow evil things away from me before beginning to talk on religious subjects. He was good
    enough to state also that he had prayed for light before coming, and had found that my heart was good. Laying one
    hand on my head, and grasping my own hand with the other, he prayed silently for some time with bowed head, and then
    lifting his hand from my head, he passed it over my face, down my shoulder and arm to the hand, which he grasped and
    pressed slightly, and then released the fingers with a graceful upward sweep, as in the minuet. The first part of
    this—the laying of the hands upon the head, afterward drawing them down along the face and chest or arms—is the
    regular Indian form of blessing, reverential gratitude, or prayerful entreaty, and is of frequent occurrence in
    connection with the Ghost dance, when the believers ask help of the priests or beg the prayers of the older people.
    The next day about twenty or more Caddo came by on their way to the agency, all dressed and painted for a dance that
    was to be held that night. They stopped awhile to see us, and on entering the room where we were the whole company,
    men, women, and children, went through the same ceremony, with each one of the inmates in turn, beginning with
    Wilson and myself, and ending with the members of the family. The ceremony occupied a considerable time, and was at
    once beautiful and impressive. Not a word was said by either party during the while, excepting as someone in excess
    of devotion would utter prayerful exclamations aloud like the undertone of a litany. Every face wore a look of
    reverent solemnity, from the old men and women down to little children of 6 and 8 years. Several of them, the women
    especially, trembled while praying, as under the excitement of the Ghost dance. The religious greeting being over,
    the women of the family, with those of the party, went out to prepare the dinner, while the rest remained to listen
    to the doctrinal discussion.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_906">906</span></p>

  <p>The Kiowa were predisposed to accept the doctrine of the Ghost dance. No tribe had made more desperate resistance
    to the encroachments of the whites upon their hunting grounds, and even after the failure of the last effort of the
    confederated tribes in 1874–75, the Kiowa were slow to accept the verdict of defeat. The result of this unsuccessful
    struggle was to put an end to the boundless freedom of the prairie, where they had roamed unquestioned from Dakota
    almost to central Mexico, and henceforth the tribes were confined within the narrow limits of reservations. Within
    five years the great southern buffalo herd was extinct and the Indians found themselves at once prisoners and
    paupers. The change was so swift and terrible in its effects that they could not believe it real and final. It
    seemed to them like a dream of sorrow, a supernatural cloud of darkness to punish their derelictions, but which
    could be lifted from them by prayer and sacrifice. Their old men told of years when the buffalo was scarce or had
    gone a long way off, but never since the beginning of the world of a time when there was no buffalo. The buffalo
    still lived beyond their horizon or in caves under the earth, and with its return would come back prosperity and
    freedom. Before we wonder at their faith we must remember that the disappearance of these millions of buffalo in the
    space of a few years has no parallel in the annals of natural history.</p>

  <p>In 1881 a young Kiowa named Da′tekañ, “Keeps-his-name-always,” began to “make medicine” to bring back the buffalo.
    He set up a sacred tipi, in front of which he erected a pole with a buffalo skin at the top, and made for himself a
    priestly robe of red color, trimmed with rows of eagle feathers. Then standing in front of his tipi he called the
    people around him and told them that he had been commanded and empowered in a dream to bring back the buffalo, and
    if they observed strictly the prayers and ceremonies which he enjoined the great herds would once more cover the
    prairie. His hearers believed his words, promised strict obedience, and gave freely of their blankets and other
    property to reward his efforts in their behalf. Da′tekañ retired to his sacred tipi, where, in his feathered robe of
    office, he continued to prophesy and make buffalo medicine for a year, when he died without seeing the realization
    of his hopes. The excitement caused by his predictions came to the notice of the agent then in charge, who mentions
    it in his annual report, without understanding the cause. On a Kiowa calendar obtained by the author the event is
    recorded in a pictograph which represents the medicine-man in his tipi, with his scarlet robe over his shoulders and
    a buffalo beneath his feet (<a href="#fig_84">figure 84</a>).</p>

  <figure class="illowp60 figright" id="fig_84">
    <img class="figbox1" src="images/fig84.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 84</span>—Two Kiowa prophecies (from a Kiowa calendar).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>About six years later, in 1887, another prophet, named Pa′-iñgya, “In the Middle,” revived the prophecy, claiming
    to be heir to all the supernatural powers of his late predecessor. He amplified the doctrine by asserting, logically
    enough, that as the whites were responsible for the disappearance of the buffalo, the whites themselves would be
    destroyed by the gods when the time was at hand for the return of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_907">907</span>
    the buffalo. He preached also his own invulnerability and claimed the power to kill with a look those who might
    offend him, as far as his glance could reach. He fixed his headquarters on Elk creek, near the western limit of the
    reservation, where he inaugurated a regular series of ritual observances, under the management of ten chosen
    assistants. Finally he announced that the time was at hand when the whites would be removed and the buffalo would
    return. He ordered all the tribe to assemble on Elk creek, where after four days he would bring down fire from
    heaven which would destroy the agency, the schools, and the white race, with the Indian unbelievers all together.
    The faithful need not fear pursuit by the troops, for the soldiers who might follow would wither before his glance
    and their bullets would have no effect on the Indians. On the same Kiowa calendar this prediction is recorded in
    another pictograph intended to represent flying bullets. The whole Kiowa tribe caught the infection of his words.
    Every camp was abandoned, parents took their children from the schools, and all fled to the rendezvous on Elk creek.
    Here they waited patiently for their deliverance till the predicted day came and passed without event, when they
    returned with sadness to their camps and their government rations of white man’s beef. Pa′-iñgya still lives, but
    the halo of prophecy no longer surrounds him. To account for the disappointment he claimed that his people had
    violated some of the ordinances and thereby postponed the destined happiness. In this way their minds were kept
    dwelling on the subject, and when at last the rumor of a messiah came from the north he hailed it as the fulfillment
    of the prediction.</p>

  <p>Early in the summer of 1890 the news of the advent of the messiah reached the Kiowa, and in June of that year they
    sent a delegation of about twenty men under the leadership of Pa′tadal, “Poor Buffalo,” to Cheyenne and Arapaho
    agency at Darlington to learn more about the matter. They brought back a favorable report and also a quantity
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_908">908</span> the sacred red paint procured originally from the country of
    the messiah. Soon after there was a great gathering of the Kiowa and Apache at the agency at Anadarko to receive a
    payment of “grass money” due from the cattlemen for the lease of pasturage on the reservation. On this occasion the
    Ghost dance was formally inaugurated among the Kiowa, Poor Buffalo assuming direction of the ceremony, and painting
    the principal participants with the sacred red paint with his own hands. The dance was carried back to their various
    camps and became a part of the tribal life.</p>

  <p>About this time a Sioux chief, High Wolf, came down from the north to visit the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, and other
    tribes in that section. He remained some time among them, and on his return to the north invited a young Kiowa named
    Ä′piatañ, “Wooden Lance,” whose grandmother had been a Sioux captive, to come up and visit his relatives at Pine
    Ridge. The invitation was accepted by Ä′piatañ, partly for the pleasure of seeing a new tribe and meeting his
    mother’s kindred, but chiefly for the purpose of investigating for himself and for the Kiowa the truth of the
    messiah story, Äpiatañ, who speaks but little English, and who was then about 30 years of age, had recently lost a
    child to whom he had been very much attached. He brooded over his loss until the new doctrine came with its promise
    of a reunion with departed friends and its possibility of seeing and talking with them in visions of the trance.
    Moved by parental affection, which is the ruling passion with an Indian, he determined on this long journey in
    search of the messiah, who was vaguely reported to be somewhere in the north, to learn from his own lips the
    wonderful story, and to see if it were possible to talk again with his child. He discussed the matter with the
    chiefs, who decided to send him as a delegate to find the messiah and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_909">
    909</span>learn the truth or falsity of the reports, in order that the Kiowa might be guided by the result on his
    return. A sufficient sum of money was raised for his expenses, and he left for the north in September, 1890. Almost
    the whole tribe had assembled at the agency to witness his departure, and each in turn of the principal men
    performed over him a ceremony of blessing, such as has already been described. His going and return are both
    recorded on the calendar previously mentioned.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>In October, 1890, shortly after Ä′piatañ’s departure, Sitting Bull, the Arapaho prophet of the Ghost dance, came
    down from his tribe and gave new impetus to the excitement among the Kiowa. This event also is recorded on the same
    Kiowa calendar in a well-drawn picture representing a buffalo standing beside the figure of a man (<a href="#fig_86">figure 86</a>). It is
    also indicated less definitely on another calendar obtained from the tribe. Sitting Bull confirmed, as by personal
    knowledge, all that had been told of the messiah, and predicted that the new earth would arrive in the following
    spring, 1891. The Kiowa assembled on the Washita, at the mouth of Rainy Mountain creek, and here, at the largest
    Ghost dance ever held by the tribe, Sitting Bull consecrated seven men and women as leaders of the dance and
    teachers of the doctrine by giving to each one a sacred feather to be worn in the dance as the badge of priesthood.
    Until the Ghost dance came to the prairie tribes their women had never before been raised to such dignity as to be
    allowed to wear feathers in their hair. After “giving the feather” to the leaders thus chosen, they were taught the
    songs and ritual of the dance. At first the songs were all in the Arapaho language, but after the trances, which now
    began to be frequent, the Kiowa composed songs of their own.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 86</span>—Sitting Bull comes down (from a Kiowa calendar).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Among the dreamers and prophets who now came to the front was one who merits more than a passing notice. His
    original name was Bi′äñk̔i, “Eater,” but on account of his frequent visits to the spirit world he is now known as
    Äsa′tito′la, which maybe freely rendered “The Messenger.” For a long time he had been in the habit of going alone
    upon the mountain, there to fast and pray until visions came to him, when he would<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_910">910</span> return and give to his people the message of inspiration. Frequently these vigils
    were undertaken at the request of friends of sick people to obtain spiritual knowledge of the proper remedies to be
    applied, or at the request of surviving relatives who wished to hear from their departed friends in the other world.
    He is now about 55 years of age, quiet and dignified in manner, with a thoughtful cast of countenance which accords
    well with his character as a priest and seer. His intellectual bent is further shown by the fact that he has
    invented a system of ideographic writing which is nearly as distinct from the ordinary Indian pictograph system as
    it is from our own alphabet. It is based on the sign language of the plains tribes, the primary effort being to
    convey the idea by a pictured representation of the gesture sign; but, as in the evolution of the alphabet, a part
    is frequently put for the whole, and numerous arbitrary or auxiliary characters are added, until the result is a
    well-developed germ of an alphabetic system. He has taught the system to his sons, and by this means was able to
    keep up a correspondence with them while they were attending Carlisle school. It is unintelligible to the rest of
    the tribe. I have specimens of this curious graphic method, obtained from the father and his sons, which maybe
    treated at length at some future time. In the picture of Äsa′tito′la (<a href="#plate_cvi">plate <span class="smcap">cvi</span></a>), he
    holds in one hand a paper on which is depicted one of his visions, while in the other is the pointer with which he
    explains its meaning.</p>

  <p><a href="#plate_cvii">Plate <span class="smcap">cvii</span></a> herewith represents this vision. On this occasion, after reaching the
    spirit world he found himself on a vast prairie covered with herds of buffalo and ponies, represented respectively
    in the picture by short black and green lines at the top. He went on through the buffalo, the way being indicated by
    the dotted green lines, until he came to a large Kiowa camp, in which, according to their old custom, nearly every
    tipi had its distinctive style of painting or ornamentation to show to what family it belonged, all these families
    being still represented in the tribe. He went on to the point indicated by the first heavy blue mark, where he met
    four young women, whom he knew as having died years before, returning on horseback with their saddle-pouches filled
    with wild plums. After some conversation he asked them about two brothers, his relatives, who had died some time
    ago. He went in the direction pointed out by the young women and soon met the two young men coming into camp with a
    load of fresh buffalo meat hung at their saddles. Their names were Emanki′na, “Can’t-hold-it,” a policeman, and
    E′‛pea, “Afraid-of-him,” who had died while held as a prisoner of war in Florida about fifteen years before. It will
    be noted that they are represented in the picture as armed only with bows and arrows, in agreement with the
    Ghost-dance doctrine of a return to aboriginal things. After proceeding some distance he retraced his steps and met
    two curious beings, represented in the picture by green figures with crosses instead of heads. These told him <span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_911">911</span>to go on, and on doing so he came to an immense circle of Kiowa
    dancing the Ghost dance around a cedar tree, indicated by the black circle with a green figure resembling a tree in
    the center. He stood for a while near the tree, shown by another blue mark, when he saw a woman, whom he knew, leave
    the dance. He hurried after her until she reached her own tipi and went into it—shown by the blue mark beside the
    red tipi with red flags on the ends of the tipi poles—when he turned around and came back. She belonged to the
    family of the great chief Sett’aiñti, “White Bear,” as indicated by the red tipi with red flags, no other warrior in
    the tribe having such a tipi. On inquiring for his own relatives he was directed to the other side of the camp,
    where he met a man—represented by the heavy black mark—who told him his own people were inside of the next tipi. On
    entering he found the whole family, consisting of his father, two brothers, two sisters, and several children,
    feasting on fresh buffalo beef from a kettle hung over the fire. They welcomed him and offered him some of the meat,
    which for some reason he was afraid to taste. To convince him that it was good they held it up for him to smell,
    when he awoke and found himself lying alone upon the mountain.</p>

  </figure>

  <p class="p2">Ä′piatañ went on first to Pine Ridge, where he was well received by the Sioux, who had much to say of the new
    messiah in the west. He was urged to stop and join them in the Ghost dance, but refused and hurried on to Fort
    Washakie, where he met the northern Arapaho and the Shoshoni, whom he called the “northern Comanches.” Here the new
    prophecy was the one topic of conversation, and after stopping only long enough to learn the proper route to the
    Paiute country, he went on over the Union Pacific railroad to Nevada. On arriving at the agency at Pyramid lake the
    Paiute furnished him a wagon and an Indian guide across the country to the home of Wovoka in the upper end of Mason
    valley. The next day he was admitted to his presence. The result was a complete disappointment. A single interview
    convinced him of the utter falsity of the pretensions of the messiah and the deceptive character of the hopes held
    out to the believers.</p>

  <p>Saddened and disgusted, Ä′piatañ made no stay, but started at once on his return home. On his way back he stopped
    at Bannock agency at Fort Hall, Idaho, and from there sent a letter to his people, stating briefly that he had seen
    the messiah and that the messiah was a fraud. This was the first intimation the Kiowa had received from an Indian
    source that their hopes were not well grounded. The author was present when the letter was received at Anadarko and
    read to the assembled Indians by Ä′piatañ’s sister, an educated woman named Laura Dunmoi, formerly of Carlisle
    school. The result was a division of opinion. Some of the Indians, feeling that the ground had been taken from under
    them, at once gave up all hope and accepted the inevitable of despair. Others were disposed to doubt the genuineness
    of the letter, as it had come through the medium of a white man, and decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_912">
    912</span> to withhold their decision until they could hear directly from the delegate himself. Ä′piatañ returned
    in the middle of February, 1891. The agent sent notice to the various camps on the reservation for the Indians to
    assemble at the agency to hear his report, and also sent a request to Cheyenne and Arapaho agency to have Sitting
    Bull come down at the same time so that the Indians might hear both sides of the story.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_913">913</span></p>

  <p>The council was held at the agency at Anadarko, Oklahoma, on February 19, 1891, the author being among those
    present on the occasion. It was a great gathering, representing every tribe on the reservation, there being also in
    attendance a number of Arapaho who had accompanied Sitting Bull from the other agency. Everything said was
    interpreted in turn into English, Kiowa, Comanche, Caddo, Wichita, and Arapaho. This was a slow process, and
    necessitated frequent repetition, so that the talk occupied all day. Ä′piatañ first made his report, which was
    interpreted into the various languages. Questions were asked by the agent, Mr Adams, and by leading Indians, and
    after the full details had been obtained in this manner Sitting Bull, the Arapaho, was called on to make his
    statement. The scene was dramatic in the highest degree. Although in a certain sense Sitting Bull himself was on
    trial, it meant more than that to the assembled tribe. Their power, prosperity, and happiness had gone down, their
    very race was withering away before the white man. The messiah doctrine promised a restoration of the old conditions
    through supernatural assistance. If this hope was without foundation, the Indian had no future and his day was
    forever past.</p>

  <p>After some preliminaries Ä′piatañ arose and told his story. He had gone on as related until he arrived at the home
    of Wovoka in Mason valley. Here he was told that the messiah could not be seen until the next day. On being finally
    admitted to his presence he found him lying down, his face covered with a blanket, and singing to himself. When he
    had finished the song the messiah uncovered his face and asked Ä′piatañ, through an interpreter, what he wanted. As
    Ä′piatañ had approached with great reverence under the full belief that the messiah was omniscient, able to read his
    secret thoughts and to speak all languages, this question was a great surprise to him, and his faith at once began
    to waver. However, he told who he was and why he had come, and then asked that he be permitted to see some of his
    dead relatives, particularly his little child. Wovoka replied that this was impossible, and that there were no
    spirits there to be seen. With their mixture of Christian and aboriginal ideas many of the Indians had claimed that
    this messiah was the veritable Christ and bore upon his hands and feet the scars of the crucifixion. Not seeing
    these scars, Ä′piatañ expressed some doubt as to whether Wovoka was really the messiah he had come so far to see, to
    which Wovoka replied that he need go no farther for there was no other messiah, and went on to say that he had
    preached to Sitting Bull and the others and had given them a new dance, but that some of them, especially the Sioux,
    had twisted things and made trouble, and now Ä′piatañ had better go home and tell his people to quit the whole
    business. Discouraged and sick at heart Ä′piatañ went out from his presence, convinced that there was no longer a
    god in Israel.</p>

  <p>After the story had been told and interpreted to each of the tribes, Sitting Bull was called on for his statement.
    He told how he had visited the messiah a year before and what the messiah had said to<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_914">914</span> him. The two versions were widely different, and there can be little question that
    Wovoka made claims and prophecies, supported by hypnotic performances, from which he afterward receded when he found
    that the excitement had gone beyond his control and resulted in an Indian outbreak. Sitting Bull insisted on the
    truth of his own representations, and when accused by Ä′piatañ of deceiving the Indians in order to obtain their
    property he replied that he had never asked them for the ponies which they had given him, and that if they did not
    believe what he had told them they could come and take their ponies again. Ä′piatañ replied that that was not the
    Kiowa road; what had once been given was not taken back. Sitting Bull spoke in a low musical voice, and the soft
    Arapaho syllables contrasted pleasantly with the choking sounds of the Kiowa and the boisterous loudness of the
    Wichita. I could not help a feeling of pity for him when at the close of the council he drew his blanket around him
    and went out from the gathering to cross the river to the Caddo camp, attended only by his faithful Arapahos. For
    his services in reporting against the dance Ä′piatañ received a medal from President Harrison.</p>

  <p>This was for some time the end of the Ghost dance among the Kiowa, for while some few of the tribes were disposed
    to doubt the honesty or correctness of the report, the majority accepted it as final, and from that time the dance
    became a mere amusement for children. The other tribes, however—the Caddo, Wichita, and their allies—refused to
    accept the report, claiming that Ä′piatañ had been hired by white men to lie to the Indians, and that he had never
    really seen the messiah, as he claimed. Even the Apache, although in close tribal connection with the Kiowa,
    continued to hold to the doctrine and the dance.</p>

  <p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Since the above was written and while awaiting publication there has been a
    revival of the Ghost dance among the Kiowa, brought about chiefly through the efforts of Bi′äñk̔i, Pa′tadal, and
    others of its former priests. After several times dispersing the dancers and threatening them with severe penalties
    if they persisted, the agent was finally obliged to give permission, on the earnest request of a delegation of
    chiefs and head men of the tribe, with the result that in September, 1894, the Kiowa publicly revived the ceremony
    in a great dance on the Washita, which lasted four days and was attended by several thousand Indians from all the
    surrounding tribes.</p>

      Washington. Besides being a particularly fine specimen of Indian pictography, it gives an excellent idea of the
      ghost dance as it was at that time among the Cheyenne and Arapaho. The dancers are in full costume, with paint and
      feathers. The women of the two tribes are plainly distinguished by the arrangement of their hair, the Cheyenne
      women having the hair braided at the side, while the Arapaho women wear it hanging loosely. Two of the women carry
      children on their backs. One of the men carries the <i>bä′qati</i> wheel, another a shinny stick, and a woman
      holds out the sacred crow, while several wave handkerchiefs which aid in producing the hypnotic effect. In the
      center are several persons with arms outstretched and rigid, while at one side is seen the medicine-man
      hypnotizing a subject who stretches out toward him a blue handkerchief. The spotted object on the ground behind

      THE CEREMONY OF THE GHOST DANCE</h2>
  </div>

  <p>In chapter <span class="smcap">xi</span> we have spoken of the Ghost dance as it existed among the Paiute,
    Shoshoni, Walapai, and Cohonino, west of the mountains. We shall now give a more detailed account of the ceremony
    and connected ritual among the prairie tribes.</p>

  <h3 id="Among_the_northern_Cheyenne">AMONG THE NORTHERN CHEYENNE</h3>

  <p>According to Dr Grinnell the Ghost dance among the northern Cheyenne had several features not found in the south.
    Four fires were built outside of the dance circle and about 20 yards back from it, toward each of the cardinal
    points. These fires were built of long poles set up on end, so as to form a rude cone, much as the poles of a tipi
    are erected. The fires were lighted at the bottom, and thus made high bonfires, which were kept up as long as the
    dance continued. (<i><a href="#JFL">J. F. L.</a>, 5.</i>)</p>

  <h3 id="Among_the_Sioux">AMONG THE SIOUX</h3>

  <p>Perhaps the most important feature in connection with the dance among the Sioux was the “ghost shirt,” already
    noticed and to be described more fully hereafter. On account of the scarcity of buckskin, these shirts were almost
    always made of white cloth cut and figured in the Indian fashion. The Sioux wore no metal of any kind in the dance,
    differing in this respect from the southern tribes, who wore on such occasions all their finery of German silver
    ornaments. The Sioux also began the dance sometimes in the morning, as well as in the afternoon or evening. Another
    important feature not found among the southern tribes, excepting the Kiowa, was the tree planted in the center of
    the circle and decorated with feathers, stuffed animals, and strips of cloth.</p>

  <p>At a Ghost dance at No Water’s camp, near Pine Ridge, as described by J. F. Asay, formerly a trader at the agency,
    the dancers first stood in line facing the sun, while the leader, standing facing them, made a prayer and waved over
    their heads the “ghost stick,” a staff about 6 feet long, trimmed with red cloth and feathers of the same color.
    After thus waving the stick over them, he faced the sun and made another prayer, after which the line closed up to
    form a circle around the tree and the dance began. During the prayer a woman standing near the tree held out a pipe
    toward the sun, while another beside her held out several (four?) arrows from which the points had been removed.
    On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_916">916</span> another occasion, at a Ghost dance at the same camp, four
    arrows, headed with bone in the olden fashion, were shot up into the air from the center of the circle and afterward
    gathered up and hung upon the tree, together with the bow, a gaming wheel and sticks, and a staff of peculiar shape
    (ghost stick?). See <a href="#plate_cxi">plate <span class="smcap">cxi</span></a>. The ceremonies of fasting, painting, and the sweat-bath
    in connection with the Ghost dance among the Sioux have been already described.</p>

  <p>The best account of the dance itself and of the ghost shirt is given by Mrs Z. A. Parker, at that time a teacher on
    the Pine Ridge reservation, writing of a Ghost dance observed by her on White Clay creek, on June 20, 1890. We quote
    at length from her description:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We drove to this spot about 10.30 oclock on a delightful October day. We came upon tents scattered here and there
      in low, sheltered places long before reaching the dance ground. Presently we saw over three hundred tents placed
      in a circle, with a large pine tree in the center, which was covered with strips of cloth of various colors, eagle
      feathers, stuffed birds, claws, and horns—all offerings to the Great Spirit. The ceremonies had just begun. In the
      center, around the tree, were gathered their medicine-men; also those who had been so fortunate as to have had
      visions and in them had seen and talked with friends who had died. A company of fifteen had started a chant and
      were marching abreast, others coming in behind as they marched. After marching around the circle of tents they
      turned to the center, where many had gathered and were seated on the ground.</p>

    <p>I think they wore the ghost shirt or ghost dress for the first time that day. I noticed that these were all new
      and were worn by about seventy men and forty women. The wife of a man called Return-from-scout had seen in a
      vision that her friends all wore a similar robe, and on reviving from her trance she called the women together and
      they made a great number of the sacred garments. They were of white cotton cloth. The women’s dress was cut like
      their ordinary dress, a loose robe with wide, flowing sleeves, painted blue in the neck, in the shape of a
      three-cornered handkerchief, with moon, stars, birds, etc, interspersed with real feathers, painted on the waist
      and sleeves. While dancing they wound their shawls about their waists, letting them fall to within 3 inches of the
      ground, the fringe at the bottom. In the hair, near the crown, a feather was tied. I noticed an absence of any
      manner of bead ornaments, and, as I knew their vanity and fondness for them, wondered why it was. Upon making
      inquiries I found they discarded everything they could which was made by white men.</p>

    <p>The ghost shirt for the men was made of the same material—shirts and leggings painted in red. Some of the
      leggings were painted in stripes running up and down, others running around. The shirt was painted blue around the
      neck, and the whole garment was fantastically sprinkled with figures of birds, bows and arrows, sun, moon, and
      stars, and everything they saw in nature. Down the outside of the sleeve were rows of feathers tied by the quill
      ends and left to fly in the breeze, and also a row around the neck and up and down the outside of the leggings. I
      noticed that a number had stuffed birds, squirrel heads, etc, tied in their long hair. The faces of all were
      painted red with a black half-moon on the forehead or on one cheek.</p>

    <p>As the crowd gathered about the tree the high priest, or master of ceremonies, began his address, giving them
      directions as to the chant and other matters. After he had spoken for about fifteen minutes they arose and formed
      in a circle. As nearly as I could count, there were between three and four hundred persons. One stood directly
      behind another, each with his hands on his neighbor’s shoulders. After walking about a few times, chanting,
      “Father, I come,” they stopped marching, but <span class="pagenum" id="Page_917">917</span>remained in the
      circle, and set up the most fearful, heart-piercing wails I ever heard—crying, moaning, groaning, and shrieking
      out their grief, and naming over their departed friends and relatives, at the same time taking up handfuls of dust
      at their feet, washing their hands in it, and throwing it over their heads. Finally, they raised their eyes to
      heaven, their hands clasped high above their heads, and stood straight and perfectly still, invoking the power of
      the Great Spirit to allow them to see and talk with their people who had died. This ceremony lasted about fifteen
      minutes, when they all sat down where they were and listened to another address, which I did not understand, but
      which I afterwards learned were words of encouragement and assurance of the coming messiah.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When they arose again, they enlarged the circle by facing toward the center, taking hold of hands, and moving
      around in the manner of school children in their play of “needle’s eye.” And now the most intense excitement
      began. They would go as fast as they could, their hands moving from side to side, their bodies swaying, their
      arms, with hands gripped tightly in their neighbors’, swinging back and forth with all their might. If one, more
      weak and frail, came near falling, he would be jerked up and into position until tired nature gave way. The ground
      had been worked and worn by many feet, until the fine, flour-like dust lay light and loose to the depth of two or
      three inches. The wind, which had increased, would sometimes take it up, enveloping the dancers and hiding them
      from view. In the ring were men, women, and children; the strong and the robust, the weak consumptive, and those
      near to death’s door. They believed those who were sick would be cured by joining in the dance and losing
      consciousness. From the beginning they chanted, to a monotonous tune, the words—</p>

    <p>All of which they would repeat over and over again until first one and then another would break from the ring and
      stagger away and fall down. One woman fell a few feet from me. She came toward us, her hair flying over her face,
      which was purple, looking as if the blood would burst through; her hands and arms moving wildly; every breath a
      pant and a groan; and she fell on her back, and went down like a log. I stepped up to her as she lay there
      motionless, but with every muscle twitching and quivering. She seemed to be perfectly unconscious. Some of the men
      and a few of the women would run, stepping high and pawing the air in a frightful manner. Some told me afterwards
      that they had a sensation as if the ground were rising toward them and would strike them in the face. Others would
      drop where they stood. One woman fell directly into the ring, and her husband stepped out and stood over her to
      prevent them from trampling upon her. No one ever disturbed those who fell or took any notice of them except to
      keep the crowd away.</p>

    <p>They kept up dancing until fully 100 persons were lying unconscious. Then they stopped and seated themselves in a
      circle, and as each one recovered from his trance he was brought to the center of the ring to relate his
      experience. Each told his story to the medicine-man and he shouted it to the crowd. Not one in ten claimed that he
      saw anything. I asked one Indian—a tall, strong fellow, straight as an arrow—what his experience was. He said he
      saw an eagle coming toward him. It flew round and round, drawing nearer and nearer until he put out his hand to
      take it, when it was gone. I asked him what he thought of it. “Big lie,” he replied. I found by talking to them
      that not one in twenty believed it. After resting for a time they would go through the same performance, perhaps
      three times a day. They practiced fasting, and every morning those who joined in the dance were obliged to immerse
      themselves in the creek. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 44.</i>)</p>

  <h3 id="Song_rehearsals">SONG REHEARSALS</h3>

  <p>As with church choirs, the leaders, both men and women, frequently assembled privately in a tipi to rehearse the
    new or old songs for the next dance. During the first winter spent among the Arapaho I had frequent opportunity of
    being present at these rehearsals, as for a long time the snow was too deep to permit dancing outside. After having
    obtained their confidence the Arapaho police invited me to come up to their camp at night to hear them practice the
    songs in anticipation of better weather for dancing. Thenceforth rehearsals were held in Black Coyote’s tipi almost
    every night until the snow melted, each session usually lasting about three hours.</p>

  <p>On these occasions from eight to twelve persons were present, sitting in a circle on the low beds around the fire
    in the center. Black Coyote acted as master of ceremonies and opened proceedings by filling and lighting the
    redstone pipe, offering the first whiff to the sun, then reversing the stem in offering to the earth, next
    presenting the pipe to the fire, and then to each of the four cardinal points. He then took a few puffs himself,
    after which he passed the pipe to his next neighbor, who went through the same preliminaries before smoking, and
    thus the pipe went round the circle, each one taking only a few puffs before passing it on. The pipe was then put
    back into its pouch, and Black Coyote, standing with his face toward the northwest, the messiah’s country, with eyes
    closed and arms outstretched, made a fervent prayer for help and prosperity to his tribe, closing with an earnest
    petition to the messiah to hasten his coming. The others listened in silence with bowed heads. The prayer ended,
    they consulted as to the song to be sung first, which Black Coyote then started in a clear musical bass, the others
    joining. From time to time explanations were made where the meaning of the song was not clear. They invited me to
    call for whatever songs I wished to hear, and these songs were repeated over and over again to give me an
    opportunity to write them down, but they waived extended discussion until another time. Usually the men alone were
    the singers, but sometimes Black Coyote’s wives or other women who were present joined in the songs. It was
    noticeable that even in these rehearsals the women easily fell under the excitement of the dance. Finally, about 10
    oclock, all rose together and sang the closing song, <i>Ni′ninitubi′na Huhu</i>, “The Crow has given the signal,”
    and the rehearsal was at an end. On one occasion, before I had obtained this song, I called for it in order that I
    might write it down, but they explained that we must wait awhile, as it was the closing song, and if they sung it
    then they must quit for the night.</p>

  <h3 id="Preparations_for_the_dance">PREPARATIONS FOR THE DANCE</h3>

  <p>On several occasions the dance ground was consecrated before the performance, one of the leaders going all about
    the place, sprinkling some kind of sacred powder over the ground and praying the while.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_919">919</span></p>

  <p>Frequently in the dance one or more of the leaders while sitting within the circle would beat upon the earth with
    his extended palm, then lay his hand upon his head, afterward blow into his hand, and then repeat the operation,
    praying all the time. Sometimes the hypnotist would beat the ground in the same way and then lay his hand on the
    head of the subject (<a href="#plate_cxv">plate <span class="smcap">cxv</span></a>). No satisfactory explanation of this ceremony was
    obtained beyond the general idea that the earth, like the sun, the fire, and the water, is sacred.</p>

  <h3 id="Giving_the_feather">GIVING THE FEATHER</h3>

  <p>The ceremony of “giving the feather” has been already noticed. This was an official ordination of the priests in
    the dance, conferred on them by the apostle who first brought the ceremony to the tribe. Among the Arapaho, Caddo,
    Kiowa, and adjoining tribes in the south the feather was conferred by Sitting Bull himself. The feather was thus
    given to seven leaders, or sometimes to fourteen, that is, seven men and seven women, the number seven being sacred
    with most tribes and more particularly in the Ghost dance. The feather, which was worn upon the head of the dancers,
    was either that of the crow, the sacred bird of the Ghost dance, or of the eagle, sacred in all Indian religions. If
    from the crow, two feathers were used, being attached at a slight angle to a small stick which was thrust into the
    hair. (See <a href="#Arapaho_8">Arapaho song 8</a>.) The feathers were previously consecrated by the priest with prayer and ceremony. The
    chosen ones usually reciprocated with presents of ponies, blankets, or other property. After having thus received
    the feather the tribe began to make songs of its own, having previously used those taught them by the apostle from
    his own language.</p>

  <p>Besides the seven leaders who wear the sacred crow feathers as emblems of their leadership, nearly all the dancers
    wear feathers variously painted and ornamented, and the preparation of these is a matter of much concern. The dancer
    who desires instruction on this point usually takes with him six friends, so as to make up the sacred number of
    seven, and goes with them to one who has been in a trance and has thus learned the exact method in vogue in the
    spirit world. At their request this man prepares for each one a feather, according to what he has seen in some
    trance vision, for which they return thanks, usually with a small present. The feathers are painted in several
    colors, each larger feather usually being tipped with a small down feather painted in a different color. On certain
    occasions a special day is set apart for publicly painting and preparing the feathers for all the dancers, the work
    being done by the appointed leaders of the ceremony.</p>

  <h3 id="Painting_of_the_dancers">THE PAINTING OF THE DANCERS</h3>

  <p>The painting of the dancers is done with the same ceremonial exactness of detail, each design being an inspiration
    from a trance vision. Usually the dancer adopts the particular style of painting which, while<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_920">920</span> in the trance, he has seen worn by some departed relative. If he has not yet been in
    a trance, the design is suggested by a vision of one who does the painting. In making the request the dancer lays
    his hands upon the head of the leader and says, “My father, I have come to be painted, so that I may see my friends;
    have pity on me and paint me,” the sacred paint being held to sharpen the spiritual vision as well as to be
    conducive to physical health. The painting consists of elaborate designs in red, yellow, green, and blue upon the
    face, with a red or yellow line along the parting of the hair. Suns, crescents, stars, crosses, and birds (crows)
    are the designs in most common use.</p>

  <h3 id="The_ceremony">THE CEREMONY</h3>

  <p>The dance commonly begins about the middle of the afternoon or later, after sundown. When it begins in the
    afternoon, there is always an intermission of an hour or two for supper. The announcement is made by the criers, old
    men who assume this office apparently by tacit understanding, who go about the camp shouting in a loud voice to the
    people to prepare for the dance. The preliminary painting and dressing is usually a work of about two hours. When
    all is ready, the leaders walk out to the dance place, and facing inward, join hands so as to form a small circle.
    Then, without moving from their places they sing the opening song, according to previous agreement, in a soft
    undertone. Having sung it through once they raise their voices to their full strength and repeat it, this time
    slowly circling around in the dance. The step is different from that of most other Indian dances, but very simple,
    the dancers moving from right to left, following the course of the sun, advancing the left foot and following it
    with the right, hardly lifting the feet from the ground. For this reason it is called by the Shoshoni the “dragging
    dance.” All the songs are adapted to the simple measure of the dance step. As the song rises and swells the people
    come singly and in groups from the several tipis, and one after another joins the circle until any number from fifty
    to five hundred men, women, and children are in the dance. When the circle is small, each song is repeated through a
    number of circuits. If large, it is repeated only through one circuit, measured by the return of the leaders to the
    starting point. Each song is started in the same manner, first in an undertone while the singers stand still in
    their places, and then with full voice as they begin to circle around. At intervals between the songs, more
    especially after the trances have begun, the dancers unclasp hands and sit down to smoke or talk for a few minutes.
    At such times the leaders sometimes deliver short addresses or sermons, or relate the recent trance experience of
    the dancer. In holding each other’s hands the dancers usually intertwine the fingers instead of grasping the hand as
    with us. Only an Indian could keep the blanket in place as they do under such circumstances. Old people hobbling
    along with sticks, and little children hardly past the toddling period sometimes form a part of the circle, the more
    vigorous dancers <span class="pagenum" id="Page_921">921</span>accommodating the movement to their weakness.
    Frequently a woman will be seen to join the circle with an infant upon her back and dance with the others, but
    should she show the least sign of approaching excitement watchful friends lead her away that no harm may come to the
    child. Dogs are driven off from the neighborhood of the circle lest they should run against any of those who have
    fallen into a trance and thus awaken them. The dancers themselves are careful not to disturb the trance subjects
    while their souls are in the spirit world. Full Indian dress is worn, with buckskin, paint, and feathers, but among
    the Sioux the women discarded the belts ornamented with disks of German silver, because the metal had come from the
    white man. Among the southern tribes, on the contrary, hats were sometimes worn in the dance, although this was not
    considered in strict accordance with the doctrine.</p>

    <figcaption class="xsmall">THE GHOST DANCE—SMALL CIRCLE</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>No drum, rattle, or other musical instrument is used in the dance, excepting sometimes by an individual dancer in
    imitation of a trance vision. In this respect particularly the Ghost dance differs from every other Indian dance.
    Neither are any fires built within the circle, so far as known, with any tribe excepting the Walapai. The northern
    Cheyenne, however, built four fires in a peculiar fashion outside of the circle, as already described. With most
    tribes the dance was performed around a tree or pole planted in the center and variously decorated. In the southern
    plains, however, only the Kiowa seem ever to have followed this method, they sometimes dancing around a cedar tree.
    On breaking the circle at the end of the dance the performers shook their blankets or shawls in the air, with the
    idea of driving away all evil influences. On later instructions from the messiah all then went down to bathe in the
    stream, the men in one place and the women in another, before going to their tipis. The idea of washing away evil
    things, spiritual as well as earthly, by bathing in running water is too natural and universal to need comment.</p>

  <p>The peculiar ceremonies of prayer and invocation, with the laying on of hands and the stroking of the face and
    body, have several times been described and need only be mentioned here. As trance visions became frequent the
    subjects strove to imitate what they had seen in the spirit world, especially where they had taken part with their
    departed friends in some of the old-time games. In this way gaming wheels, shinny sticks, hummers, and other toys or
    implements would be made and carried in future dances, accompanied with appropriate songs, until the dance sometimes
    took on the appearance of an exhibition of Indian curios on a small scale.</p>

  <h3 id="The_crow_dance">THE CROW DANCE</h3>

  <p>Within the last few years the southern Arapaho and Cheyenne have developed an auxiliary dance called the “crow
    dance,” which is performed in the afternoon as a preliminary to the regular Ghost dance at night. As it is no part
    of the original Ghost dance and is confined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_922">922</span> these two tribes,
    it deserves no extended notice in this connection. Although claimed by its inventors as a direct inspiration from
    the other world, where they saw it performed by “crows,” or spirits of departed friends, it is really only a
    modification of the picturesque Omaha dance of the prairie tribes, with the addition of religious features borrowed
    from the new doctrine. The men participating are stripped to the breechcloth, with their whole bodies painted as in
    the Omaha dance, and wear elaborate pendants of varicolored feathers hanging down behind from the waist. An immense
    drum is an important feature. Men and women take part, and the songs refer to the general subject of the crow and
    the messiah, but are set to a variety of dance steps and evolutions performed by the dancers. As the leaders, who
    are chiefly young men, are constantly studying new features, the crow dance has become one of the most attractive
    ceremonies among the prairie tribes. Hypnotism and trances form an essential feature of this as of the Ghost dance
    proper. (See <a href="#plate_cxix">plate <span class="smcap">cxix</span></a>.)</p>

  <h3 id="The_hypnotic_process">THE HYPNOTIC PROCESS</h3>

  <p>The most important feature of the Ghost dance, and the secret of the trances, is hypnotism. It has been hastily
    assumed that hypnotic knowledge and ability belong only to an overripe civilization, such as that of India and
    ancient Egypt, or to the most modern period of scientific investigation. The fact is, however, that practical
    knowledge, if not understanding, of such things belongs to people who live near to nature, and many of the stories
    told by reliable travelers of the strange performances of savage shamans can be explained only on this theory.
    Numerous references in the works of the early Jesuit missionaries, of the Puritan writers of New England, and of
    English explorers farther to the south, would indicate that hypnotic ability no less than sleight-of-hand dexterity
    formed part of the medicine-man’s equipment from the Saint Lawrence to the Gulf. Enough has been said in the
    chapters on Smoholla and the Shakers to show that hypnotism exists among the tribes of the Columbia, and the author
    has had frequent opportunity to observe and study it in the Ghost dance on the plains. It can not be said that the
    Indian priests understand the phenomenon, for they ascribe it to a supernatural cause, but they know how to produce
    the effect, as I have witnessed hundreds of times. In treating of the subject in connection with the Ghost dance the
    author must be understood as speaking from the point of view of an observer and not as a psychologic expert.</p>

  <p>Immediately on coming among the Arapaho and Cheyenne in 1890, I heard numerous stories of wonderful things that
    occurred in the Ghost dance—how people died, went to heaven and came back again, and how they talked with dead
    friends and brought back messages from the other world. Quite a number who had thus “died” were mentioned and their
    adventures in the spirit land were related with great particularity of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_923">
    923</span>detail, but as most of the testimony came from white men, none of whom had seen the dance for
    themselves, I preserved the scientific attitude of skepticism. So far as could be ascertained, none of the
    intelligent people of the agency had thought the subject sufficiently worthy of serious consideration to learn
    whether the reports were true or false. On talking with the Indians I found them unanimous in their statements as to
    the visions, until I began to think there might be something in it.</p>

  <figure class="illowp100" id="plate_cxiii">
    <div class="plate">PL. CXIII</div>

    <div class="attr smcap">Mary Irvin Wright</div>
    <figcaption class="xsmall">THE GHOST DANCE—LARGER CIRCLE</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The first clue to the explanation came from the statement of his own experience in the trance, given by Paul
    Boynton, a particularly bright Carlisle student, who acted as my interpreter. His brother had died some time before,
    and as Paul was anxious to see and talk with him, which the new doctrine taught was possible, he attended the next
    Ghost dance, and putting his hands upon the head of Sitting Bull, according to the regular formula, asked him to
    help him see his dead brother. Paul is of an inquiring disposition, and, besides his natural longing to meet his
    brother again, was actuated, as he himself said, by a desire to try “every Indian trick.” He then told how Sitting
    Bull had hypnotized him with the eagle feather and the motion of his hands, until he fell unconscious and did really
    see his brother, but awoke just as he was about to speak to him, probably because one of the dancers had
    accidentally brushed against him as he lay on the ground. He embodied his experience in a song which was afterward
    sung in the dance. From his account it seemed almost certain that the secret was hypnotism. The explanation might
    have occurred to me sooner but for the fact that my previous Indian informants, after the manner of some other
    witnesses, had told only about their trance visions, forgetting to state how the visions were brought about.</p>

  <p>This was in winter and the ground was covered deeply with snow, which stopped the dancing for several weeks. In the
    meantime I improved the opportunity by visiting the tipis every night to learn the songs and talk about the new
    religion. When the snow melted, the dances were renewed, and as by this time I had gained the confidence of the
    Indians I was invited to be present and thereafter on numerous occasions was able to watch the whole process by
    which the trances were produced. From the outside hardly anything can be seen of what goes on within the circle, but
    being a part of the circle myself I was able to see all that occurred inside, and by fixing attention on one subject
    at a time I was able to note all the stages of the phenomenon from the time the subject first attracted the notice
    of the medicine-man, through the staggering, the rigidity, the unconsciousness, and back again to wakefulness. On
    two occasions my partner in the dance, each time a woman, came under the influence and I was thus enabled to note
    the very first nervous tremor of her hand and mark it as it increased in violence until she broke away and staggered
    toward the medicine-man within the circle.</p>

  <p>Young women are usually the first to be affected, then older women, and lastly men. Sometimes, however, a man
    proves as sensitive as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_924">924</span> average woman. In particular I have
    seen one young Arapaho become rigid in the trance night after night. He was a Carlisle student, speaking good
    English and employed as clerk in a store. He afterward took part in the sun dance, dancing three days and nights
    without food, drink, or sleep. He is of a quiet, religious disposition, and if of white parentage would perhaps have
    become a minister, but being an Indian, the same tendency leads him into the Ghost dance and the sun dance. The fact
    that he could endure the terrible ordeal of the sun dance would go to show that his physical organization is not
    frail, as is frequently the case with hypnotic or trance subjects. So far as personal observation goes, the hypnotic
    subjects are usually as strong and healthy as the average of their tribe. It seems to be a question more of
    temperament than of bodily condition or physique. After having observed the Ghost dance among the southern tribes at
    intervals during a period of about four years, it is apparent that the hypnotic tendency is growing, although the
    original religious excitement is dying out. The trances are now more numerous among the same number of dancers. Some
    begin to tremble and stagger almost at the beginning of the dance, without any effort on the part of the
    medicine-man, while formerly it was usually late in the night before the trances began, although the medicine-men
    were constantly at work to produce such result. In many if not in most cases the medicine-men themselves have been
    in trances produced in the same fashion, and must thus be considered sensitives as well as those hypnotized by them.</p>

  <p>Not every leader in the Ghost dance is able to bring about the hypnotic sleep, but anyone may try who feels so
    inspired. Excepting the seven chosen ones who start the songs there is no priesthood in the dance, the authority of
    such men as Sitting Bull and Black Coyote being due to the voluntary recognition of their superior ability or
    interest in the matter. Any man or woman who has been in a trance, and has thus derived inspiration from the other
    world, is at liberty to go within the circle and endeavor to bring others to the trance. Even when the result is
    unsatisfactory there is no interference with the performer, it being held that he is but the passive instrument of a
    higher power and therefore in no way responsible. A marked instance of this is the case of Cedar Tree, an Arapaho
    policeman, who took much interest in the dance, attending nearly every performance in his neighborhood, consecrating
    the ground and working within the circle to hypnotize the dancers. He was in an advanced stage of consumption,
    nervous and excitable to an extreme degree, and perhaps it was for this reason that those who came under his
    influence in the trance constantly complained that he led them on the “devil’s road” instead of the “straight road;”
    that he made them see monstrous and horrible shapes, but never the friends whom they wished to see. On this account
    they all dreaded to see him at work within the circle, but no one commanded him to desist as it was held that he was
    controlled by a stronger power and was to be pitied rather than blamed for his ill success. A similar idea <span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_925">925</span>exists in Europe in connection with persons reputed to possess the
    evil eye. Cedar Tree himself deplored the result of his efforts and expressed the hope that by earnest prayer he
    might finally be able to overcome the evil influence.</p>

    <figcaption class="xsmall">THE GHOST DANCE—LARGE CIRCLE</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>We shall now describe the hypnotic process as used by the operators, with the various stages of the trance. The
    hypnotist, usually a man, stands within the ring, holding in his hand an eagle feather or a scarf or handkerchief,
    white, black, or of any other color. Sometimes he holds the feather in one hand and the scarf in the other. As the
    dancers circle around singing the songs in time with the dance step the excitement increases until the more
    sensitive ones are visibly affected. In order to hasten the result certain songs are sung to quicker time, notably
    the Arapaho song beginning <i>Nû′nanû′naatani′na Hu′hu</i>. We shall assume that the subject is a woman. The first
    indication that she is becoming affected is a slight muscular tremor, distinctly felt by her two partners who hold
    her hands on either side. The medicine-man is on the watch, and as soon as he notices the woman’s condition he comes
    over and stands immediately in front of her, looking intently into her face and whirling the feather or the
    handkerchief, or both, rapidly in front of her eyes, moving slowly around with the dancers at the same time, but
    constantly facing the woman. All this time he keeps up a series of sharp exclamations, Hu! Hu! Hu! like the rapid
    breathing of an exhausted runner. From time to time he changes the motion of the feather or handkerchief from a
    whirling to a rapid up-and-down movement in front of her eyes. For a while the woman continues to move around with
    the circle of dancers, singing the song with the others, but usually before the circuit is completed she loses
    control of herself entirely, and, breaking away from the partners who have hold of her hands on either side, she
    staggers into the ring, while the circle at once closes up again behind her. She is now standing before the
    medicine-man, who gives his whole attention to her, whirling the feather swiftly in front of her eyes, waving his
    hands before her face as though fanning her, and drawing his hand slowly from the level of her eyes away to one side
    or upward into the air, while her gaze follows it with a fixed stare. All the time he keeps up the Hu! Hu! Hu! while
    the song and the dance go on around them without a pause. For a few minutes she continues to repeat the words of the
    song and keep time with the step, but in a staggering, drunken fashion. Then the words become unintelligible sounds,
    and her movements violently spasmodic, until at last she becomes rigid, with her eyes shut or fixed and staring, and
    stands thus uttering low pitiful moans (<a href="#plate_cxvii">plate <span class="smcap">cxvii</span></a>). If this is in the daytime, the
    operator tries to stand with his back to the sun, so that the full sunlight shines in the woman’s face (<a href="#plate_cxvi">plate <span
    class="smcap">cxvi</span></a>). The subject may retain this fixed, immovable posture for an indefinite time, but at
    last falls heavily to the ground, unconscious and motionless (<a href="#plate_cxviii">plate <span class="smcap">cxviii</span></a>). The dance
    and the song never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_926">926</span> stop, but as soon as the woman falls the
    medicine-man gives his attention to another subject among the dancers. The first one may lie unconscious for ten or
    twenty minutes or sometimes for hours, but no one goes near to disturb her, as her soul is now communing with the
    spirit world. At last consciousness gradually returns. A violent tremor seizes her body as in the beginning of the
    fit. A low moan comes from her lips, and she sits up and looks about her like one awaking from sleep. Her whole form
    trembles violently, but at last she rises to her feet and staggers away from the dancers, who open the circle to let
    her pass. All the phenomena of recovery, except rigidity, occur in direct reverse of those which precede
    unconsciousness.</p>

  <p>Sometimes before falling the hypnotized subject runs wildly around the circle or out over the prairie, or goes
    through various crazy evolutions like those of a lunatic. On one occasion—but only once—I have seen the medicine-man
    point his finger almost in the face of the hypnotized subject, and then withdrawing his finger describe with it a
    large circle about the tipis. The subject followed the direction indicated, sometimes being hidden from view by the
    crowd, and finally returned, with his eyes still fixed and staring, to the place where the medicine-man was
    standing. There is frequently a good deal of humbug mixed with these performances, some evidently pretending to be
    hypnotized in order to attract notice or to bring about such a condition from force of imitation, but the greater
    portion is unquestionably genuine and beyond the control of the subjects. In many instances the hypnotized person
    spins around for minutes at a time like a dervish, or whirls the arms with apparently impossible speed, or assumes
    and retains until the final fall most uncomfortable positions which it would be impossible to keep for any length of
    time under normal conditions. Frequently a number of persons are within the ring at once, in all the various stages
    of hypnotism. The proportion of women thus affected is about three times that of men.</p>

  <h3 id="The_area_covered_by_the_dance">THE AREA COVERED BY THE DANCE</h3>

  <p>It is impossible to give more than an approximate statement as to the area of the Ghost dance and the messiah
    doctrine and the number of Indians involved. According to the latest official report, there are about 146,000
    Indians west of Missouri river, exclusive of the five civilized nations in Indian Territory. Probably all these
    tribes heard of the new doctrine, but only a part took any active interest in it. Generally speaking, it was never
    taken up by the great tribe of the Navaho, by any of the Pueblos except the Taos, or by any of the numerous tribes
    of the Columbia region. The thirty or thirty-five tribes more or less concerned with the dance have an aggregate
    population of about 60,000 souls. A number of these were practically unanimous in their acceptance of the new
    doctrine, notably the Paiute, Shoshoni, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Caddo, and Pawnee, while of others, as the Comanche, only
    a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_927">927</span>small minority ever engaged in it. Only about one-half of the
    26,000 Sioux took an active part in it. It may safely be said, however, that the doctrine and ceremony of the Ghost
    dance found more adherents among our tribes than any similar Indian religious movement within the historic period,
    with the single possible exception of the crusade inaugurated by Tenskwatawa, the Shawano prophet, in 1805. (See
    <a href="#plate_lxxxv">plate <span class="smcap">lxxxv</span></a>.)</p>

  <h3 id="Present_condition_of_the_dance">PRESENT CONDITION OF THE DANCE</h3>

  <p>Among most of these tribes the movement is already extinct, having died a natural death, excepting in the case of
    the Sioux. The Shoshoni and some others lost faith in it after the failure of the first predictions. The Sioux
    probably discontinued the dance before the final surrender, as the battle of Wounded Knee and the subsequent events
    convinced even the most fanatic believers that their expectations of invulnerability and supernatural assistance
    were deceptive. The Paiute were yet dancing a year ago, and as their dream has received no such rude awakening as
    among the Sioux, they are probably still patiently awaiting the great deliverance, in spite of repeated
    postponements, although the frenzied earnestness of the early period has long ago abated. The Kiowa, who discarded
    the doctrine on the adverse report of Ä′piatañ, have recently taken up the dance again and are now dancing as
    religiously as ever under the leadership of the old men, although the progressive element in the tribe is strongly
    opposed to it. Among the other tribes in Oklahoma—especially the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Caddo, Wichita, Pawnee, and
    Oto—the Ghost dance has become a part of the tribal life and is still performed at frequent intervals, although the
    feverish expectation of a few years ago has now settled down into something closely approaching the Christian hope
    of a reunion with departed friends in a happier world at some time in the unknown future.</p>

  <p>As for the great messiah himself, when last heard from Wovoka was on exhibition as an attraction at the Midwinter
    fair in San Francisco. By this time he has doubtless retired into his original obscurity.</p>

  <h3 id="The_Biblical_period">THE BIBLICAL PERIOD</h3>

  <p>The remote in time or distance is always strange. The familiar present is always natural and a matter of course.
    Beyond the narrow range of our horizon imagination creates a new world, but as we advance in any direction, or as we
    go back over forgotten paths, we find ever a continuity and a succession. The human race is one in thought and
    action. The systems of our highest modern civilizations have their counterparts among all the nations, and their
    chain of parallels stretches backward link by link until we find their origin and interpretation in the customs and
    rites of our own barbarian ancestors, or of our still existing aboriginal tribes. There is nothing new under the
    sun.</p>

  <p>The Indian messiah religion is the inspiration of a dream. Its ritual is the dance, the ecstasy, and the trance.
    Its priests are hypnotics and cataleptics. All these have formed a part of every great religious development of
    which we have knowledge from the beginning of history.</p>

  <p>In the ancestors of the Hebrews, as described in the Old Testament, we have a pastoral people, living in tents,
    acquainted with metal working, but without letters, agriculture, or permanent habitations. They had reached about
    the plane of our own Navaho, but were below that of the Pueblo. Their mythologic and religious system was closely
    parallel. Their chiefs were priests who assumed to govern by inspiration from God, communicated through frequent
    dreams and waking visions. Each of the patriarchs is the familiar confidant of God and his angels, going up to
    heaven in dreams and receiving direct instructions in waking visits, and regulating his family and his tribe, and
    ordering their religious ritual, in accord with these instructions. Jacob, alone in the desert, sleeps and dreams,
    and sees a ladder reaching to heaven, with angels going up and down upon it, and God himself, who tells him of the
    future greatness of the Jewish nation. So Wovoka, asleep on the mountain, goes up to the Indian heaven and is told
    by the Indian god of the coming restoration of his race. Abraham is “tempted” by God and commanded to sacrifice his
    son, and proceeds to carry out the supernatural injunction. So Black Coyote dreams and is commanded to sacrifice
    himself for the sake of his children.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_929">929</span></p>

  <p>Coming down to a later period we find the Chaldean Job declaring that God speaketh “in a dream, in a vision of the
    night, when deep sleep falleth upon men; then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth their instruction.” The whole
    of the prophecies are given as direct communications from the other world, with the greatest particularity of
    detail, as, for instance, in the beginning of the book of Ezekiel, where he says that “it came to pass in the
    thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of
    Chebar, that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.”</p>

  <p>In the New Testament, representing the results of six centuries of development beyond the time of the prophets and
    in intimate contact with more advanced civilizations, we still have the dream as the controlling influence in
    religion. In the very beginning of the new dispensation we are told that, while Joseph slept, the angel of the Lord
    appeared to him in a dream, and as a result “Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden
    him.” The most important events in the history of the infant redeemer are regulated, not in accordance with the
    ordinary manner of probabilities, but by dreams.</p>

  <p>The four gospels are full of inspirational dreams and trances, such as the vision of Cornelius, and that of Peter,
    when he went up alone upon the housetop to pray and “fell into a trance and saw heaven opened,” and again when “a
    vision appeared to Paul in the night,” of a man who begged him to come over into Macedonia, so that “immediately we
    endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us.” In another place Paul—the same
    Paul who had that wonderful vision on the road to Damascus—declares that he knew a man who was caught up into
    paradise and heard unspeakable words. In Paul we have the typical religious evangel, a young enthusiast, a man of
    sensibility and refinement above his fellows, so carried away by devotion to his ideal that he attaches himself to
    the most uncompromising sect among his own people, and when it seems to be assailed by an alien force, not content
    simply to hold his own belief, he seeks and obtains official authority to root out the heresy. As he goes on this
    errand, “breathing out threatenings and slaughter,” the mental strain overcomes him. He falls down in the road,
    hears voices, and sees a strange light. His companions raise him up and lead him by the hand into the city, where
    for several days he remains sightless without food or drink. From this time he is a changed man. Without any
    previous knowledge or investigation of the new faith he believes himself called by heaven to embrace it, and the
    same irrepressible enthusiasm which had made him its bitterest persecutor leads him now to defend it against all the
    world and even to cross the sea into a far country in obedience to a dream to spread the doctrine. In many respects
    he reminds us forcibly of such later evangelists as Fox and Wesley.</p>

  <p>The cloudy indistinctness which Wovoka and his followers ascribe to the Father as he appears to them in their
    trance visions has numerous parallels in both Testaments. At Sinai the Lord declares to Moses, “I<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_930">930</span> come unto thee in a thick cloud,” and thereafter whenever Moses went
    up the mountain or entered into the tabernacle to receive revelations “the Lord descended upon it in a cloudy
    pillar.” Job also tells us that “thick clouds are a covering to him,” and Isaiah says that he “rideth upon a swift
    cloud,” which reminds us of the Ghost song of the Arapaho representing the Indian redeemer as coming upon the
    whirlwind. Moses goes up into a mountain to receive inspiration like Wovoka of the Paiute and Bi′äñk̔i of the Kiowa.
    As Wovoka claims to bring rain or snow at will, so Elijah declares that “there shall not be dew nor rain these
    years, but according to my word,” while of the Jewish Messiah himself his wondering disciples say that even the
    winds and the sea obey him.</p>

  <p>Fasting and solitary contemplation in lonely places were as powerful auxiliaries to the trance condition in Bible
    days as now among the tribes of the plains. When Daniel had his great vision by the river Hiddekel, he tells us that
    he had been mourning for three full weeks, during which time he “ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine
    in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all.” When the vision comes, all the strength and breath leave his body
    and he falls down, and “then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.” Six hundred years
    later, Christ is “led by the spirit into the wilderness, being forty days tempted by the devil, and in those days he
    did eat nothing.” Another instance occurs at his baptism, when, as he was coming out of the water, he saw the
    heavens opened and the spirit like a dove, and heard a voice, and immediately was driven by the spirit into the
    wilderness. In the transfiguration on the mountain, when “his face did shine as the sun,” and in the agony of
    Gethsemane, with its mental anguish and bloody sweat, we see the same phenomena that appear in the lives of
    religious enthusiasts from Mohammed and Joan of Arc down to George Fox and the prophets of the Ghost dance.</p>

  <p>Dancing, which forms so important a part of primitive rituals, had a place among the forms of the ancient Hebrew
    and of their neighbors, although there are but few direct references to it in the Bible. The best example occurs in
    the account of the transfer of the ark to Zion, where there were processions and sacrifices, and King David himself
    “danced before the Lord with all his might.”</p>

  <h3 id="Mohammedanism">MOHAMMEDANISM</h3>

  <p>Six hundred years after the birth of Christianity another great religion, which numbers its adherents by the
    hundred million, had its origin in the same region and among a kindred Semitic race. Its prophet and high priest was
    the cataleptic Mohammed, who was born about the year 570 and died in 642. In infancy and all through life he was
    afflicted with epileptic attacks and fainting fits, during which he would lose all appearance of life without always
    losing inner consciousness. It was while in this condition that he received the visions and revelations on which he
    built his religious system. Frequently at such times it was necessary to wrap him up to preserve life in his body,
    and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_931">931</span>at other times he was restored by being drenched with cold
    water. At one time for a period of two years he was in such a mental condition—subject to hallucinations—that he
    doubted his own sanity, believing himself to be possessed by evil spirits, and contemplated suicide. “It is disputed
    whether Mohammed was epileptic, cataleptic, hysteric, or what not. Sprenger seems to think that the answer to this
    medical question is the key to the whole problem of Islam.” (“<i>Mohammedanism</i>,” in <i>Encyclopedia
      Britannica</i>.) To how many other systems might such an answer be the key?</p>

  <figure class="illowp100" id="plate_cxvii">
    <div class="plate">PL. CXVII</div>
    <img class="figbox2" src="images/plate_cxvii.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="xsmall">THE GHOST DANCE—RIGID</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>We are told that ordinarily his body had but little natural warmth, but that whenever the angel appeared to him, as
    the Mohammedan biographers express it, the perspiration burst out on his forehead, his eyes became red, he trembled
    violently, and would bellow like a young camel—all the accompaniments of the most violent epileptic fit. Usually the
    fit ended in a swoon. There is no question that he was sincere in his claim of divine inspiration. His last hours
    were serene and peaceful, and there is no evidence of the slightest misgiving on his part as to the reality of his
    mission as a prophet sent from God. Some of his inspiration came in dreams, and he was accustomed to say that a
    prophet’s dream is a revelation. At times the revelation came to him without any painful or strange accompaniment.</p>

  <p>The fit during which he received the revelation of his religious mission is thus described, as it came to him after
    a long period of despondency and mental hallucinations: “In this morbid state of feeling he is said to have heard a
    voice, and on raising his head, beheld Gabriel, who assured him he was the prophet of God. Frightened, he returned
    home, and called for covering. He had a fit, and they poured cold water on him, and when he came to himself he heard
    these words: ‘Oh, thou covered one, arise, and preach, and magnify thy Lord;’ and henceforth, we are told, he
    received revelations without intermission. Before this supposed revelation he had been medically treated on account
    of the evil eye, and when the Koran first descended to him he fell into fainting fits, when, after violent
    shudderings, his eyes closed, and his mouth foamed.” (<i>Gardner, Faiths of the World.</i>)</p>

  <p>Solitude also had much to do with his visions, as a great part of his early life was spent in the lonely occupation
    of a shepherd among the Arabian mountains. Like other prophets he asserted that the various angels had offered him
    control over the stars, the sun, the mountains, and the sea. Further, it is claimed most positively by all his
    followers that his great ascent into the seven heavens was made bodily and in full wakefulness, and not merely in
    spirit while asleep, and this assertion they supported by “the declarations of God and his prophet, the imâms of the
    truth, the verses of the Koran, and thousands of traditions,” as earnestly as religious enthusiasts the world over
    have ever backed up the impossible.</p>

  <p>The kinship of the late Semitic idea to the old is well exemplified in Mohammed’s account of this vision, in which
    he is conducted to Mount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_932">932</span> Sinai, where he is directed to alight
    and pray, because there God had spoken to Moses, after which he is conducted to Bethlehem, where again he is
    directed to alight and pray, because there Jesus was born, after which again he is brought into the presence of
    Abraham, Moses, Enoch, John the Baptist, and Jesus, by all of whom he was hailed as a worthy brother and prophet.
    The direct descent becomes plainer still when we learn how Mohammed, on his return from talking with God in the
    seventh heaven, again meets Moses, who persuades him that the religious exercises prescribed by God for the faithful
    are too onerous, and goes back with him to plead with the Lord for a reduction of the daily prayers from fifty to
    five as Abraham pleaded for Sodom.</p>

  <p>The spirit world of our Indians is a place where death and old age are unknown, and where every one is happy in the
    simple happiness which he knew on earth—hunting, feasting, and playing the old-time games with former friends, but
    without war, for there all is peace. The ideal happiness is material, perhaps, but it is such happiness as the world
    might long for, with nothing in it gross or beyond reasonable probability. The Semitic ideal, from which our own is
    derived, is very different. We get one conception, in the book of Revelation and the limits of space, whose business
    is every morning to praise the Lord and set all the cocks on earth to crowing after him. There is an angel who
    bathes daily in a river, after which he flaps his wings, and from every drop that falls from them there is created
    an angel with 20,000 faces and 40,000 tongues, each of which speaks a distinct language, unintelligible to the rest.
    But the masterpiece is the tree <i>tooba</i>, whose fruit is the food of the inhabitants of paradise. Every branch
    produces a hundred thousand different-colored fruits, while from its roots run rivers of water, milk, wine, and
    honey. As if this were not enough, the tree produces also ready-made clothing. “On the tree were baskets filled with
    garments of the brocade and satin of paradise. A million of baskets are allotted to each believer, each basket
    containing a hundred thousand garments, all of different class and fashion”—and so on ad nauseam. (<i>Merrick’s
    Mohammed.</i>) When we reflect that this is accepted by more than 150,000,000 civilized Orientals, from whom we
    have derived much of our own culture, we may, perhaps, be more tolerantly disposed toward the American Indian
    belief.</p>

  <h3 id="Joan_of_Arc">JOAN OF ARC</h3>

  <p>The most remarkable, the most heroic and pathetic instance of religious hallucination in Europe is that of Joan of
    Arc, known as the Maid of Orleans, born in 1412 and burned at the stake in 1431, and recently <span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_933">933</span>beatified as the patron saint of France. Naturally of a contemplative disposition,
    she was accustomed from earliest childhood to long fasts and solitary communings, in which she brooded over the
    miserable condition of her country, then overrun by English armies. When 13 years of age, she had a vision in which
    a voice spoke to her from out of a great light, telling her that God had chosen her to restore France. She
    immediately fell on her knees and made a vow of virginity and entire devotion to the cause, and from that day to the
    time of her cruel death she believed herself inspired and guided by supernatural voices to lead her countrymen
    against the invader. A simple peasant girl, she sought out the royal court and boldly announced to the king her
    divine mission. Her manner made such an impression that she was assigned a command, and putting on a soldier’s dress
    and carrying a sword which she claimed had come to her through miraculous means, she led the armies of France,
    performing superhuman feats of courage and endurance and winning victory after victory for three years until she was
    finally captured. After a long and harassing mockery of a trial, in which the whole machinery of the law and the
    church was brought into action for the destruction of one poor girl barely 19 years of age, she was finally
    condemned and burned at Rouen, ostensibly as a witch and a heretic, but really as the most dangerous enemy of
    English tyranny in France.</p>

    <figcaption class="xsmall">THE GHOST DANCE—UNCONSCIOUS</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>She was forever hearing these spirit voices, which she called “her voices” or “her counsel.” They spoke to her with
    articulate words in the ripple of the village fountain, in the vesper bells, in the rustling of the leaves, and in
    the sighing of the wind. Sometimes it was the warlike archangel Michael, but oftener it was the gentle Saint
    Katherine, who appeared to her as a beautiful woman wearing a crown. Her visions must be ascribed to the effect of
    the troubled times in which she lived, acting on an enthusiastic, unquestioning religious temperament. She is
    described as physically robust and intellectually keen, aside from her hallucination, as was proven in her trial,
    and there is no evidence that she was subject to epilepsy or other abnormal conditions such as belonged to Mohammed
    and most others of the same class. Her long and frequent fasts unquestionably aided the result. She claimed no
    supernatural powers outside of her peculiar mission, and in every public undertaking relied entirely on the guidance
    of her voices.</p>

  <p>Toward the end these voices were accompanied by other hallucinations, together with presentiments of her coming
    death. On one occasion, while assaulting a garrison, her men fled, leaving her standing on the moat with only four
    or five soldiers. Seeing her danger, a French officer galloped up to rescue her and impatiently asked her why she
    stood there alone. Lifting her helmet from her face she looked at him with astonishment and replied that she was not
    alone—that she had 50,000 men with her—and then, despite his entreaties, she turned to her phantom army and shouted
    out her commands to bring logs to bridge the moat. It was in April, while standing alone on the ramparts<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_934">934</span> of Mélun, that the voices first told her that she would be taken
    before midsummer. From that time the warning was constantly repeated, and although she told no one and still exposed
    herself fearlessly, she no longer assumed the responsibility of command. Two months later she was in the hands of
    her enemies.</p>

  <p>Throughout the trial every effort was made by her enemies to shake her statement as to the voices, or, failing in
    that, to prove them from the devil, but to the last she steadfastly maintained that the voices were with her and
    came from heaven. According to her own statement these voices were three—one remained always with her, another
    visited her at short intervals, while both deliberated with the third. On one occasion, when hard pressed by her
    enemies, she answered solemnly, “I believe firmly, as firmly as I believe the Christian faith and that God has
    redeemed us from the pains of hell, that the voice comes from God and by his command.” And again she asserted, “I
    have seen Saint Michael and the two saints so well that I know they are saints of paradise. I have seen them with my
    bodily eyes, and I believe they are saints as firmly as I believe that God exists.”</p>

  <p>When questioned as to her original inspiration, she stated that the voice had first come to her when she was about
    13 years of age. “The first time I heard it I was very much afraid. It was in my father’s garden at noon in the
    summer. I had fasted the day before. The voice came from the right hand by the church, and there was a great light
    with it. When I came into France, I heard it frequently. I believe it was sent me from God. After I heard it three
    times, I knew it was the voice of an angel. I understand perfectly what it says. It bade me be good and go to church
    often, and it told me I must go into France. Two or three times a week it said I must go into France, until I could
    no longer rest where I was. It told me I should raise the siege of Orleans, and that Robert de Baudricourt would
    give me people to conduct me. Twice he repulsed me, but the third time he received me and sped me on my way.”</p>

  <p>The examiners were very curious to know by what sign she had recognized the king when she had first seen him in the
    midst of his courtiers. To this question she said she must first consult with Saint Katherine before replying, and
    afterward continued: “The sign was a crown. The first time I saw the king he had the sign, and it signified that he
    should hold the kingdom of France. I neither touched it nor kissed it. The angel came by the command of God and
    entered by the door of the room. I came with the angel up the steps to the king’s room and the angel came before the
    king and bowed and inclined himself before the king, and said: ‘My lord, here is your sign; take it.’ He departed by
    the way he had come. There were a number of other angels with him, and Saint Katherine and Saint Margaret. In the
    little chapel he left me. I was neither glad nor afraid, but I was very sorrowful, and I wish he had taken away my
    soul with him.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_935">935</span></p>

  <p>To another question she replied emphatically: “If I were at judgment, if I saw the fire kindled and the fagots
    ablaze and the executioner ready to stir the fire, and if I were in the fire, I would say no more, and to the death
    I would maintain what I have said in the trial.”</p>

  <p>The end came at last in the market place of Rouen, when this young girl, whose name for years had been a terror to
    the whole English army, was dragged in her white shroud and bound to the stake, and saw the wood heaped up around
    her and the cruel fire lighted under her feet. “Brother Martin, standing almost in the draft of the flames, heard
    her sob with a last sublime effort of faith, bearing her witness to God whom she trusted: ‘My voices have not
    deceived me!’ And then came death.” (<i><a href="#Parr">Parr</a>, Jeanne d’Arc.</i>)</p>

  <h3 id="Dance_of_Saint_John">DANCE OF SAINT JOHN</h3>

  <p>In 1374 an epidemic of maniacal religious dancing broke out on the lower Rhine and spread rapidly over Germany, the
    Netherlands, and into France. The victims of the mania claimed to dance in honor of Saint John. Men and women went
    about dancing hand in hand, in pairs, or in a circle, on the streets, in the churches, at their homes, or wherever
    they might be, hour after hour without rest until they fell into convulsions. While dancing they sang doggerel
    verses in honor of Saint John and uttered unintelligible cries. Of course they saw visions. At last whole companies
    of these crazy fanatics, men, women, and children, went dancing through the country, along the public roads, and
    into the cities, until the clergy felt compelled to interfere, and cured the dancers by exorcising the evil spirits
    that moved them. In the fifteenth century the epidemic broke out again. The dancers were now formed into divisions
    by the clergy and sent to the church of Saint Vitus at Rotestein, where prayers were said for them, and they were
    led in procession around the altar and dismissed cured. Hence the name of Saint Vitus’ dance given to one variety of
    abnormal muscular tremor. (<i><a href="#Schaff">Schaff</a>, Religious Encyclopedia.</i>)</p>

  <h3 id="The_Flagellants">THE FLAGELLANTS</h3>

  <p>About the same time another strange religious extravagance spread over western Europe. Under the name of
    Flagellants, thousands of enthusiasts banded together with crosses, banners, hymns, and all the paraphernalia of
    religion, and went about in procession, publicly scourging one another as an atonement for their sins and the sins
    of mankind in general. They received their first impetus from the preaching of Saint Anthony of Padua in the
    thirteenth century. About the year 1260 the movement broke out nearly simultaneously in Italy, France, Germany,
    Austria, and Poland, and afterward spread into Denmark and England. It was at its height in the fourteenth century.
    In Germany in 1261 the devotees, preceded by banner and crosses, marched with faces veiled and bodies bared above
    the waist, and scourged themselves twice a day for thirty-three successive days in<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_936">936</span> memory of the thirty-three years of Christ’s life. The strokes of the whip were
    timed to the music of hymns. Men and women together took part in the scourging. The mania finally wore itself out,
    but reappeared in 1349 with more systematic organization. According to Schaff, “When they came to towns, the bands
    marched in regular military order and singing hymns. At the time of flagellation they selected a square or
    churchyard or field. Taking off their shoes and stockings and forming a circle, they girded themselves with aprons
    and laid down flat on the ground.... The leader then stepped over each one, touched them with the whip, and bade
    them rise. As each was touched they followed after the leader and imitated him. Once all on their feet the
    flagellation began. The brethren went two by two around the whole circle, striking their backs till the blood
    trickled down from the wounds. The whip consisted of three thongs, each with four iron teeth. During the
    flagellation a hymn was sung. After all had gone around the circle the whole body again fell on the ground, beating
    upon their breasts. On arising they flagellated themselves a second time. While the brethren were putting on their
    clothes a collection was taken up among the audience. The scene was concluded by the reading of a letter from
    Christ, which an angel had brought to earth and which commended the pilgrimages of the Flagellants. The fraternities
    never tarried longer than a single day in a town. They gained great popularity, and it was considered an honor to
    entertain them.” (<i><a href="#Schaff">Schaff</a>, Religious Encyclopedia.</i>) The society still exists among the Latin races, although
    under the ban of the church. As late as 1820 a procession of Flagellants passed through the streets of Lisbon. Under
    the name of Penitentes they have several organizations in the Mexican towns of our southwest, where they
    periodically appear in processions, inflicting horrible self-torture on themselves, even to the extent of binding
    one of their number upon a cross, which is then set up in the ground, while the blood streams down the body of the
    victim from the wounds made by a crown of cactus thorns and from innumerable gashes caused by the thorny whips. Such
    things among people called civilized enables us to understand the feeling which leads the Indian to offer himself a
    willing sacrifice in the sun dance and other propitiatory rites.</p>

  <h3 id="Ranters_Quakers_and_Fifth_Monarchy_men">RANTERS, QUAKERS, AND FIFTH-MONARCHY MEN</h3>

  <p>The middle of the seventeenth century was a time of great religious and political upheaval in England. Hatreds were
    intense and persecutions cruel and bitter, until men’s minds gave way under the strain. “The air was thick with
    reports of prophecies and miracles, and there were men of all parties who lived on the border land between sanity
    and insanity.” This was due chiefly to the long-continued mental tension which bore on the whole population during
    this troublous period, and in particular cases to wholesale confiscations, by which families were ruined, and to
    confinement in wretched prisons, suffering from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_937">937</span> insufficient food
    and brutal treatment. Individuals even in the established church began to assert supernatural power, while numerous
    new sects sprang up, with prophecy, miracle working, hypnotism, and convulsive ecstasy as parts of their doctrine or
    ritual. Chief among these were the Ranters, the Quakers, and the Fifth-Monarchy Men. The first and last have
    disappeared with the conditions which produced them; but the Quakers, being based on a principle, have outlasted
    persecution, and, discarding the extravagances which belonged to the early period, are now on a permanent foundation
    under the name of the “Society of Friends.” One of the Ranter prophets, in 1650, claimed to be the reincarnation of
    Melchizedek, and even declared his divinity. He asserted that certain persons then living were Cain, Judas,
    Jeremiah, etc., whom, he had raised from the dead, and the strangest part of it was that the persons concerned
    stoutly affirmed the truth of his assertion. Others of them claimed to work miracles and to produce lights and
    apparitions in the dark. In Barclay’s opinion all the evidence “supports the view that these persons were mad, and
    had a singular power of producing a kind of sympathetic madness or temporary aberration of intellect in others.”</p>

  <p>We are better acquainted with the Quakers (Friends), although it is not generally known that they were originally
    addicted to similar practices. Such, however, is the fact, as is shown by the name itself. Their founder, George
    Fox, claimed and believed that he had the gift of prophecy and clairvoyance, and of healing by a mere word, and his
    biographer, Janney, of the same denomination, apparently sees no reason to doubt that such was the case. As might
    have been expected, he was also a believer in dreams.</p>

  <p>We are told that on one occasion, on coming into the town of Lichfield, “a very remarkable exercise attended his
    mind, and going through the streets without his shoes he cried, ‘Woe to the bloody city of Lichfield.’ His feelings
    were deeply affected, for there seemed to be a channel of blood running down the streets, and the market place
    appeared like a pool of blood.” On inquiry he learned that a large number of Christians had been put to death there
    during the reign of the Emperor Diocletian thirteen centuries before. “He therefore attributed the exercise which
    came upon him to the sense that was given him of the blood of the martyrs.”</p>

  <p>We are also told that he “received an evidence” of the great fire of London in 1666, before the event, and Janney
    narrates at length a “still more remarkable vision” of the same fire by another Friend, “whose prophecy is well
    attested.” According to the account, this man rode into the city, as though having come in haste, and went up and
    down the streets for two days, prophesying that the city would be destroyed by fire. To others of his own
    denomination he declared that he had had a vision of the event some time before, but had delayed to declare it as
    commanded, until he felt the fire in his own bosom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_938">938</span> When the fire
    did occur as he had predicted, he stood before the flames with arms outstretched, as if to stay their advance, until
    forcibly brought away by his friends.</p>

  <p>In mental and physical temperament Fox seems to have closely resembled Mohammed and the Indian prophets of the
    Ghost dance. We are told that he had much mental suffering and was often under great temptation. “He fasted much,
    and walked abroad in solitary places. Taking his Bible, he sat in hollow trees or secluded spots, and often at night
    he walked alone in silent meditation.” At one time “he fell into such a condition that he looked like a corpse, and
    many who came to see him supposed him to be really dead. In this trance he continued fourteen days, after which his
    sorrow began to abate, and with brokenness of heart and tears of joy he acknowledged the infinite love of God.”
    (<i><a href="#Janney">Janney</a>, George Fox.</i>)</p>

  <p>The sect obtained the name of Quakers from the violent tremblings which overcame the worshipers in the early days,
    and which they regarded as manifestations of divine power on them. So violent were these convulsions that, as their
    own historian tells us, on one occasion the house itself seemed to be shaken. According to another authority, men
    and women sometimes fell down and lay upon the ground struggling as if for life. Their ministers, however, seem not
    to have encouraged such exhibitions, but strove to relieve the fit by putting the patient to bed and administering
    soothing medicines. (<i>“Quakers,” Encyclopedia Britannica.</i>)</p>

  <p>The Fifth-Monarchy Men were a small band of religionists who arose about the same time, proclaiming that the “Fifth
    Monarchy” prophesied by Daniel was at hand, when Christ would come down from heaven and reign visibly upon earth for
    a thousand years. In 1657 they formed a plot to kill Cromwell, and in 1661 they broke out in insurrection at night,
    parading the streets with a banner on which was depicted a lion, proclaiming that Christ had come and declaring that
    they were invulnerable and invincible, as “King Jesus” was their invisible leader. Troops were called out against
    them, but the Fifth-Monarchy Men, expecting supernatural assistance, refused to submit, and fought until they were
    nearly all shot down. The leaders were afterward tried and executed. (<i><a href="#Janney">Janney’s</a> George Fox</i> and <i><a href="#Schaff">Schaff’s</a>
    Religious Encyclopedia</i>.)</p>

  <h3 id="French_prophets">FRENCH PROPHETS</h3>

  <p>Forty years later, about the end of the seventeenth century, another sect of convulsionists, being driven out of
    France, “found an asylum in Protestant countries [and] carried with them the disease, both of mind and body, which
    their long sufferings had produced.” They spread into Germany and Holland, and in 1706 reached England, where they
    became known as “French prophets.” Their meetings were characterized by such extravagance of convulsion and trance
    performance that they became the wonder of the ignorant and the scandal of the more<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_939">939</span> intelligent classes, notwithstanding which the infection spread far and wide. We are
    told that they “were wrought upon in a very extraordinary manner, not only in their minds, but also in their
    physical systems. They had visions and trances and were subject to violent agitations of body. Men and women, and
    even little children, were so exercised that spectators were struck with great wonder and astonishment. Their
    powerful admonitions and prophetic warnings were heard and received with reverence and awe.”</p>

  <p>At one time Charles Wesley had occasion to stop for the night with a gentleman who belonged to the sect. Wesley was
    unaware of the fact until, as they were about to go to bed, his new friend suddenly fell into a violent fit and
    began to gobble like a turkey. Wesley was frightened and began exorcising him, so that he soon recovered from the
    fit, when they went to bed, although the evangelist confesses that he himself did not sleep very soundly with Satan
    so near him.</p>

  <p>Some time afterward Wesley with several companions visited a prophetess of the sect, as he says, to try whether the
    spirits came from God. She was a young woman of agreeable speech and manner. “Presently she leaned back in her chair
    and had strong workings in her breast and uttered deep sighs. Her head and her hands and by turns every part of her
    body were affected with convulsive motions. This continued about ten minutes. Then she began to speak with a clear,
    strong voice, but so interrupted with the workings, sighings, and contortions of her body that she seldom brought
    forth half a sentence together. What she said was chiefly in spiritual words, and all as in the person of God, as if
    it were the language of immediate inspiration.” (<i><a href="#Southey">Southey’s</a> Wesley, I</i>, and <i><a href="#Evans">Evans’</a> Shakers</i>.)</p>

  <h3 id="Jumpers">JUMPERS</h3>

  <p>About 1740 a similar extravagant sect, known as the Jumpers, arose in Wales. According to the description given by
    Wesley, their exercises were a very exact parallel of the Ghost dance. “After the preaching was over anyone who
    pleased gave out a verse of a hymn, and this they sung over and over again, with all their might and main, thirty or
    forty times, till some of them worked themselves into a sort of drunkenness or madness; they were then violently
    agitated, and leaped up and down in all manner of postures frequently for hours together.” A contemporary writer
    states that he had seen perhaps ten thousand at a single meeting of the Jumpers shouting out in the midst of the
    sermon and ready to leap for joy. (<i><a href="#Southey">Southey’s</a> Wesley</i>, <i>II</i>.)</p>

  <h3 id="Methodists">METHODISTS</h3>

  <p>About the same time the Methodists originated in England under Wesley and Whitefield, and their assemblies were
    characterized by all the hysteric and convulsive extravagance which they brought with them to this country, and
    which is not even yet extinct in the south.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_940">940</span> The most remarkable
    of these exhibitions took place under the preaching of Wesley, following him, as we are told, wherever he went.
    Whitefield, although more forcible and sensational in his preaching, did not at first produce the same effect on his
    hearers, and considered such manifestations as but doubtful signs of the presence of the Lord and by no means to be
    encouraged. On preaching, however, to a congregation in which Wesley had already produced such convulsions, and
    where, consequently, there was a predisposition in this direction, several persons were thus seized and sank down
    upon the floor, and we are told by the biographer “this was a great triumph to Wesley.”</p>

  <p>Wesley himself describes several instances. At one time, he states, a physician suspecting fraud attended a meeting
    during which a woman was thrown into a fit, crying aloud and weeping violently, until great drops of sweat ran down
    her face and her whole body shook. The doctor stood close by, noting every symptom, and not knowing what to think,
    being convinced that it was not fraud or any natural disorder. “But when both her soul and body were healed in a
    moment he acknowledged the finger of God.” On another occasion, Wesley tells us, “While I was earnestly inviting all
    men to enter into the Holiest by this new and living way, many of those that heard began to call upon God with
    strong cries and tears. Some sank down, and there remained no strength in them. Others exceedingly trembled and
    quaked. Some were torn with a kind of convulsive motion in every part of their bodies, and that so violently that
    often four or five persons could not hold one of them. I have seen many hysterical and epileptic fits, but none of
    them were like these in many respects. I immediately prayed that God would not suffer those who were weak to be
    offended; but one woman was greatly, being sure that they might help it if they would, no one should persuade her to
    the contrary; and she was got three or four yards, when she also dropped down in as violent an agony as the rest.”</p>

  <p>At another time, “while he was speaking one of his hearers dropped down, and in the course of half an hour seven
    others, in violent agonies. The pains as of hell, he says, came about them; but notwithstanding his own reasoning
    neither he nor his auditors called in question the divine origin of these emotions, and they went away rejoicing and
    praising God.... Sometimes he scarcely began to speak before some of his believers, overwrought with expectation,
    fell into the crisis, for so it may be called in this case, as properly as in animal magnetism. Sometimes his voice
    could scarcely be heard amid the groans and cries of these suffering and raving enthusiasts. It was not long before
    men, women, and children began to act the demoniac as well as the convert. Wesley had seen many hysterical fits and
    many fits of epilepsy, but none that were like these, and he confirmed the patients in their belief that they were
    torn of Satan. One or two indeed perplexed him a little, for they were tormented in such an unaccountable manner
    that they seemed to be lunatic, he says, as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_941">941</span> sore vexed.
    But suspicions of this kind made little impression upon his intoxicated understanding; the fanaticism which he had
    excited in others was now reacting upon himself. How should it have been otherwise? A Quaker, who was present at one
    meeting and inveighed against what he called the dissimulation of these creatures, caught the contagious emotion
    himself, and even while he was biting his lips and knitting his brows, dropped down as if he had been struck by
    lightning.” (<i><a href="#Southey">Southey’s</a> Wesley.</i>)</p>

  <h3 id="Shakers">SHAKERS</h3>

  <p>About the year 1750 there originated in England another peculiar body of sectarians calling themselves the “United
    Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing,” but commonly known, for obvious reasons, as Shakers. Their chief
    prophetess and founder was “Mother” Ann Lee, whom they claim as the actual reincarnation of Christ. They claim also
    the inspiration of prophecy, the gift of healing, and sometimes even the gift of tongues, and believe in the reality
    of constant intercourse with the spirit world through visions. In consequence of persecution in England, on account
    of their public dancing, shouting, and shaking, they removed to this country about 1780 and settled at New Lebanon,
    New York, where the society still keeps up its organization.</p>

  <p>The best idea of the Shakers is given in a small volume by Evans, who was himself a member of the sect. Speaking of
    the convulsive manifestations among them, he says: “Sometimes, after sitting awhile in silent meditation, they were
    seized with a mighty trembling, under which they would often express the indignation of God against all sin. At
    other times they were exercised with singing, shouting, and leaping for joy at the near prospect of salvation. They
    were often exercised with great agitation of body and limbs, shaking, running, and walking the floor, with a variety
    of other operations and signs, swiftly passing and repassing each other like clouds agitated with a mighty wind.
    These exercises, so strange in the eyes of the beholders, brought upon them the appellation of Shakers, which has
    been their most common name of distinction ever since.” With regard to their dancing, he says: “It is pretty
    generally known that the Shakers serve God by singing and dancing; but why they practice this mode of worship is not
    so generally understood.... When sin is fully removed, by confessing and forsaking it, the cause of heaviness,
    gloom, and sorrow is gone, and joy and rejoicing, and thanksgiving and praise are then the spontaneous effects of a
    true spirit of devotion. And whatever manner the spirit may dictate, or whatever the form into which the spirit may
    lead, it is acceptable to Him from whom the spirit proceeds.” On one particular occasion, “previous to our coming we
    called a meeting and there was [sic] so many gifts (such as prophecies, revelations, visions, and dreams) in
    confirmation of a former revelation for us to come that some could hardly wait for others to tell their gifts. We
    had a joyful meeting and danced till morning.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_942">942</span></p>

  <p>Of Ann Lee, their founder, he asserts that she saw Jesus Christ in open vision and received direct revelations from
    this source. On a certain occasion she herself declared to her followers: “The room over your head is full of angels
    of God. I see them, and you could see them if you were redeemed. I look in at the windows of heaven and see what
    there is in the invisible world. I see the angels of God, and hear them sing. I see the glories of God. I see
    Ezekiel Goodrich flying from one heaven to another!” And, turning to the company present, she said, “Go in and join
    his resurrection.” She then began to sing, and they praised the Lord in the dance. On another occasion she said:
    “The apostles, in their day, saw as through a glass darkly, but we see face to face, and see things as they are, and
    converse with spirits and see their states. The gospel is preached to souls who have left the body. I see thousands
    of the dead rising and coming to judgment, now at this present time.” At another time she declared that she had seen
    a certain young woman in the spirit world, “praising God in the dance;” and of a man deceased, “He has appeared to
    me again, and has arisen from the dead and come into the first heaven and is traveling on to the second and third
    heaven.”</p>

  <p>Their dance is performed regularly at their religious gatherings at the New Lebanon settlement. The two sexes are
    arranged in ranks opposite and facing each other, in which position they listen to a sermon by one of the elders,
    after which a hymn is sung. They then form a circle around a party of singers, to whose singing they keep time in
    the dance. At times the excitement and fervor of spirit become intense, and their bodily evolutions as rapid as
    those of the dervishes, although still preserving the order of the dance. (<i><a href="#Evans">Evans’</a> Shakers</i> and encyclopedia
    articles on <i>Shakers</i>.)</p>

  <h3 id="Kentucky_revival">KENTUCKY REVIVAL</h3>

  <p>About the year 1800 an epidemic of religious frenzy, known as the Kentucky Revival, broke out in Kentucky and
    Tennessee, chiefly among the Methodists and Baptists, with accompaniments that far surpassed the wildest excesses of
    the Ghost dance. Fanatic preachers taught their deluded followers that the spiritual advent of the kingdom was near
    at hand, when Christ would reign on earth and there would be an end of all sin. The date generally fixed for the
    consummation was the summer of 1805, and the excitement continued and grew in violence for several years until the
    time came and passed without extraordinary event, when the frenzy gradually subsided, leaving the ignorant believers
    in a state of utter collapse. The performances at the meetings of these enthusiasts were of the most exaggerated
    camp-meeting order, such as may still be witnessed in many parts of the south, especially among the colored people.
    Evans, the Shaker historian, who is strong in the gift of faith, tells us that “the subjects of this work were
    greatly exercised in dreams, visions, revelations, and the spirit of prophecy. In these gifts of the spirit they saw
    and testified that the great day of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_943">943</span> God was at hand, that Christ
    was about to set up his kingdom on earth, and that this very work would terminate in the full manifestation of the
    latter day of glory.”</p>

  <p>From another authority, endowed perhaps with less of fervor but with more of common sense, we get a description of
    these “exercises” which has a familiar ring that seems to bring it very near home. “The people remained on the
    ground day and night, listening to the most exciting sermons, and engaging in a mode of worship which consisted in
    alternate crying, laughing, singing, and shouting, accompanied with gesticulations of a most extraordinary
    character. Often there would be an unusual outcry; some bursting forth into loud ejaculations of thanksgiving;
    others exhorting their careless friends to ‘turn to the Lord;’ some struck with terror, and hastening to escape;
    others trembling, weeping, and swooning away, till every appearance of life was gone, and the extremities of the
    body assumed the coldness of a corpse. At one meeting not less than a thousand persons fell to the ground,
    apparently without sense or motion. It was common to see them shed tears plentifully about an hour before they fell.
    They were then seized with a general tremor, and sometimes they uttered one or two piercing shrieks in the moment of
    falling. This latter phenomenon was common to both sexes, to all ages, and to all sorts of characters.” (<i>Caswall,
    The Prophet of the Nineteenth Century</i>, quoted by <i><a href="#Remy">Remy</a></i>.)</p>

  <p>After a time these crazy performances in the sacred name of religion became so much a matter of course that they
    were regularly classified in categories as the rolls, the jerks, the barks, etc. “The rolling exercise was affected
    by doubling themselves up, then rolling from one side to the other like a hoop, or in extending the body
    horizontally and rolling over and over in the filth like so many swine. The jerk consisted in violent spasms and
    twistings of every part of the body. Sometimes the head was twisted round so that the head was turned to the back,
    and the countenance so much distorted that not one of its features was to be recognized. When attacked by the jerks,
    they sometimes hopped like frogs, and the face and limbs underwent the most hideous contortions. The bark consisted
    in throwing themselves on all fours, growling, showing their teeth, and barking like dogs. Sometimes a number of
    people crouching down in front of the minister continued to bark as long as he preached. These last were supposed to
    be more especially endowed with the gifts of prophecy, dreams, rhapsodies, and visions of angels.” (<i><a href="#Remy">Remy</a>, Journey
    to Great Salt Lake City, I.</i>)</p>

  <p>Twenty years later the jerking epidemic again broke out in Tennessee, and is described in a letter by the famous
    visionary and revivalist, Lorenzo Dow, who was then preaching in the same region. His description agrees with that
    given the author by old men who lived at this time in eastern Tennessee. We quote from Dow’s letter: “There
    commenced a trembling among the wicked. One and a second fell from their seats. I think for eleven hours there was
    no cessation of the loud cries. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_944">944</span> the people, some who were
    standing and sitting fell like men shot on the field of battle, and I felt it like a tremor to run through my soul
    and veins so that it took away my limb power, so that I fell to the floor, and by faith saw a greater blessing than
    I had hitherto experienced.” At another place he says: “After taking a cup of tea, I began to speak to a vast
    audience, and I observed about thirty to have the jerks, though they strove to keep as still as they could. These
    emotions were involuntary and irresistible, as any unprejudiced mind might see.” At Marysville “many appeared to
    feel the word, but about fifty felt the jerks. On Sunday, at Knoxville, the governor being present, about one
    hundred and fifty had the jerking exercise, among them a circuit preacher, Johnson, who had opposed them a little
    while before. Camp meeting commenced at Liberty. Here I saw the jerks, and some danced. The people are taken with
    jerking irresistibly, and if they strive to resist it it worries them more than hard work. Their eyes, when dancing,
    seem to be fixed upward as if upon an invisible object, and they are lost to all below. I passed by a meeting house
    where I observed the undergrowth had been cut down for a camp meeting, and from fifty to a hundred saplings left
    breast high, which appeared to me so slovenish that I could not but ask my guide the cause, who observed they were
    topped so high and left for the people to jerk by. This so excited my attention that I went over the ground to view
    it, and found where the people had laid hold of them and jerked so powerfully that they kicked up the earth as a
    horse stamping flies. Persecutors are more subject to the jerks than others, and they have cursed and swore and
    damned it while jerking.” Then he says: “I have seen Presbyterians, Methodists, Quakers, Baptists, Church of
    England, and Independents exercised with the jerks—gentlemen and ladies, black and white, rich and poor—without
    exception. Those naturalists who wish to get it to philosophize upon it and the most godly are excepted from the
    jerks. The wicked are more afraid of it than of the smallpox or yellow fever.”</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note that, according to his account, investigators who wished to study the phenomenon were unable
    to come under the influence, even though they so desired.</p>

  <h3 id="Adventists">ADVENTISTS</h3>

  <p>About 1831 William Miller, a licensed minister, began to preach the advent of Christ and the destruction of the
    world, fixing the date for the year 1843. Like most others of his kind who have achieved notoriety, he based his
    prediction on the prophecies of the Bible, which he figured out with mathematical exactness. He began preaching in
    New York and New England, but afterward traveled southward, delivering, it is said, over three thousand lectures in
    support of his theory. His predictions led to the formation of a new sect commonly known as<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_945">945</span> Adventists, who are said at one time to have numbered over fifty thousand. Carried
    away by blind enthusiasm they made their preparations for the end of all things, which they confidently expected in
    the summer of 1843. As the time drew near the believers made all preparations for their final departure from the
    world, many of them selling their property, and arraying themselves in white “ascension robes,” which were actually
    put on sale by the storekeepers for the occasion. But the day and the year went by without the fulfillment of the
    prophecy. Miller claimed to have discovered an error in his calculations and fixed one or two other dates later on,
    but as these also proved false, his followers lost faith and the delusion died out. The Adventists still number
    fifteen or twenty thousand, the largest body being in southern Michigan, but although they hold the doctrine of the
    near advent of the final end, and endeavor to be at all times ready, they no longer undertake to fix the date.</p>

  <p>It may be noted here that the idea of a millennium, when the Messiah shall come in person upon the earth and reign
    with the just for a thousand years, was so firmly held by many of the early Christians that it may almost be said to
    have formed a part of the doctrinal tradition of the church. The belief was an inheritance from the Jews, many of
    whose sacred writers taught that time was to endure through seven great “years” of a thousand years each, the
    seventh and last being the Sabbatical year or millennium, when their Messiah would appear and make their kingdom the
    mistress of the world. For this materialistic view of the millennium the Christian fathers substituted a belief in
    the spiritual triumph of religion, when the armies of antichrist would be annihilated, but the expectation of the
    return of Christ to rule in person over his church before the last days was an essential part of the doctrine,
    founded on numerous prophecies of both the Old and the New Testament.</p>

  <h3 id="Other_parallels">OTHER PARALLELS</h3>

  <h4 id="Beekmanites">BEEKMANITES</h4>

  <p>It would require a volume to treat of the various religious abnormalisms, based on hypnotism, trances, and the
    messiah idea, which have sprung up and flourished in different parts of our own country even within the last twenty
    years. Naturally these delusions thrived best among the ignorant classes, but there were some notable exceptions,
    particularly in the case of the Beekmanites or “Church of the Redeemed.” About 1875 Mrs Dora Beekman, the wife of a
    Congregational minister in Rockford, Illinois, began preaching that she was the immortal reincarnation of Jesus
    Christ. Absurd as this claim may appear, she found those who believed her, and as her converts increased in numbers
    they established their headquarters, which they called “heaven,” near Rockford, built a church, and went zealously
    to work to gather proselytes. Beekman refused to believe the new doctrine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_946">
    946</span> but being unable to convince his wife of her folly he was finally driven to insanity. In the meantime
    the female Christ found an able disciple in the Reverend George Schweinfurth, a young Methodist minister of
    considerable cultivation and ability, who was installed as bishop and apostle of the new sect. Mrs Beekman dying
    soon after, in spite of her claim to immortality, Schweinfurth at once stepped into her place, declaring that the
    Christly essence had passed from her into himself. His claim was accepted, and when last heard from, about three
    years ago, he was worshiped by hundreds of followers drawn from the most prominent denominations of the vicinity as
    the risen Christ, the lord of heaven and the immortal maker and ruler of the earth. (<i><a href="#JFL">J. F. L.</a>, 6</i>, and current
    newspapers.)</p>

  <h4 id="Patterson_and_Browns_mission">PATTERSON AND BROWN’S MISSION</h4>

  <p>In 1888 a man named Patterson, in Soddy, a small town in eastern Tennessee, began preaching that a wonderful thing
    was about to happen, and after the matter had been talked about sufficiently for his purpose, he announced that
    Christ had come in the person of A. J. Brown, who had served as Patterson’s assistant. Later on Brown disappeared,
    and it was announced that he had gone up into the mountain to fast for forty days and nights in order to be
    fittingly prepared for his mission. At the end of this period, on a Sunday morning in June, his followers went out
    toward the hills, where he suddenly appeared before them, clothed in white, with his hands uplifted. A great shout
    went up, and the people rushed toward him, falling upon their knees and kissing his feet. Many who were ill declared
    themselves healed by his touch. So great was the fanaticism of these people that one girl declared she was ready to
    die to prove her faith, and the nonbelievers became so fearful that human life would be sacrificed that they sent
    for the sheriff at Chattanooga, and it required all his power to compel Patterson and Brown to leave the
    neighborhood that quiet might be restored. (<i><a href="#JFL">J. F. L.</a>, 6.</i>)</p>

  <h4 id="Wilderness_worshipers">WILDERNESS WORSHIPERS</h4>

  <p>In 1889 and 1890 a remarkable messianic excitement developed among the negroes along Savannah river in Georgia and
    South Carolina, where one man after another proclaimed himself as Christ, promised miracles, drew crowds of excited
    men and women from their work, and created a general alarm among the white population of the whole section. The most
    prominent of these Christs was a mulatto named Bell, who went about preaching his divinity and exhorting all who
    would be saved to give up everything and follow him. Hundreds of negroes abandoned the cotton fields, the sawmills,
    and the turpentine woods to follow him, obeying his every word and ready to fall down and worship him. They assumed
    the name of “Wilderness Worshipers,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_947">947</span> and set up in the woods a
    “temple” consisting of a series of circular seats around an oak. The excitement became so demoralizing and dangerous
    that Bell was finally arrested. His frenzied disciples would have resisted the officers, but he commanded them to be
    patient, declaring that he could not be harmed and that an angel would come and open his prison doors by night. As
    no specific charge could be formulated against him, he was released after a short time, and continued his preaching
    to greater crowds than before. At last he announced that the world would come to an end on August 16, 1890; that all
    the negroes would then turn white and all white men black, and that all who wished to ascend on the last day must
    purchase wings from him. (<i><a href="#JFL">J. F. L.</a>, 6.</i>) He was finally adjudged insane and sent to the asylum. Successors
    arose in his place, however, and kept up the excitement for a year afterward in spite of the efforts of the
    authorities to put a stop to it. One of these claimed to be King Solomon, while another asserted that he was
    Nebuchadnezzar, and emphasized his claim by eating grass on all fours. In addition to the “temple” in the woods they
    set up an “ark,” and were told by the leaders that any persecutors who should sacrilegiously attempt to touch it
    would fall down dead. Notwithstanding this warning, the officers destroyed both ark and temple in their efforts to
    end the delusion. At last a woman was killed by the enthusiasts, and a series of wholesale arrests followed. King
    Solomon, Nebuchadnezzar, and others who were clearly insane were sent to join Bell in the asylum, and the others
    were released from custody after the excitement had waned.</p>

  <h4 id="Heavenly_recruits">HEAVENLY RECRUITS</h4>

  <p>Within the last five years various local revivalists have attracted attention in different sections of Indiana,
    Illinois, and Missouri, by their extravagances, among which prophecies, visions, trances, and frenzied bodily
    exercises were all prominent. Particularly at the meetings of the “Heavenly Recruits” in central Indiana, and at
    other gatherings under the direction of Mrs Woodworth, cataleptic trances were of nightly occurrence. The physical
    and mental demoralization at last became so great that the meetings were suppressed by the authorities.</p>

  <p>From the beginning of history the dance and kindred physical exercises have formed a part of the religious ritual
    of various oriental sects, while hypnotic powers and practices have been claimed for their priests. This is
    especially true of the Mohammedan sect or order of the Dervishes, of which some account is given in the appendix to
    this chapter.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_948">948</span></p>

  <h3 id="Appendix_XVI">APPENDIX—HYPNOTISM AND THE DANCE AMONG THE DERVISHES</h3>

  <div class="center small">[From Brown’s Dervishes]</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Hypnotism.</span>—It is through the performance of the Zikr, by khalvet (pious retirement for
    purposes of deep devotion), by the Tevejjuh (or turning the face or mind devoutly toward God in prayer), by the
    Murakebeh (or fearful contemplation of God), the Tesarruf (or self-abandonment to pious reflection and inspiration),
    and the Tesavvuf (or mystical spiritualism), that the fervent Dervish reaches peculiar spiritual powers called
    <i>Kuvveh i roohee batinee</i> (a mystical, internal, spiritual power). The life or biography of every eminent
    sheikh or peer details innumerable evidences of this power exercised in a strange and peculiar manner. This exercise
    is called the Kuvveh Iradat, or the “Power of the Will,” and, as a theory, may be traced historically to the Divine
    Power—the soul of man being connected with the Divine Spirit—from which it emanates, and with which, through the
    means before mentioned, it commences. Some sheikhs are more celebrated than others for their peculiar and strange
    powers, and it is to their superiority that their reputation and reverence in the Mussulman world in general, and
    among Dervishes in particular, is to be attributed. With the supposition that the details given of them by their
    biographers, disciples, or successors are not invented, or even exaggerated, their powers are certainly very
    remarkable. Whilst among them an implicit belief in them is firmly sustained, sultans and princes have evidently
    doubted them, and, being alarmed with the influence the possessors acquired and sustained among the public
    generally, they have often shown a direful exercise of their own arbitrary will and power, which resulted in the
    untimely end of the unfortunate sheikh. Many, on the other hand, have survived the frequent exercise of their
    “spiritual powers,” and either because they acquired a power and influence over the minds of their temporal rulers,
    or whether they used them for their own private purposes, so as to conciliate the more religious or fanatic, they
    succeeded in reaching advanced ages and a peaceful end of their remarkable careers. When the ruler of the country
    has not cared to order the execution of the sheikh who declared himself possessed of these spiritual powers, he has
    simply exiled him from his capital or his territory, and permitted him freely to exercise his powers and renown in
    some less objectionable locality. These powers can only be acquired through the long instruction of a superior
    spiritual director, or Murshid, or As-hâb i Yekeen, for whom the disciples ever retain a most grateful remembrance
    and attachment.</p>

  <p>Among the practices of these powers is the faculty of foreseeing coming events; of predicting their occurrence; of
    preserving individuals from the harm and evil which would otherwise certainly result for them; of assuring to one
    person success over the machinations of another, so that he may freely attack him and prevail over him; of restoring
    harmony of sentiment between those who would otherwise be relentless enemies; of knowing when others devised harm
    against themselves, and through certain spells of preserving themselves and causing harm to befall the evil minded,
    and even of causing the death of anyone against whom they wish to proceed. All this is done as well from a distance
    as when near.</p>

  <p>In other parts of the world, and among other people, these attainments would have been attributed to sorcery and
    witchcraft; in modern times they would be ascribed to spiritism, or magnetic influences, either of the spirit or of
    the body; but to the instructed Dervish they all derive their origin in the spirit of the holy sheikh—the special
    gift of the great Spirit of God, which commences with the spirit of man, from which it directly emanated. The
    condition or disposition necessary for these effects is called the Hâl (state or frame), and is much the same as
    that required by the magnetized, and the object of his operation. The powers of the body are enfeebled by fasting
    and mental fatigue in prayer, and the imagination kept in a fervid state, fully impressed with the conviction that
    such powers are really possessed by the sheikh, and that he can readily exercise them over the<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_949">949</span> willing mind and body of the disciple. How the sheikh can produce such strange
    results on a distant and unconscious person is left to the admiration and imagination of the faithful disciple, as
    an incentive to exertions in the same true path as that of his sheikh.</p>

  <p>To exercise the power of the will, it is necessary to contract the thoughts suddenly upon the object designed to be
    affected so perfectly as to leave no room for the mind to dwell, possibly, upon any other. The mind must not doubt
    for an instant of the success of this effort, nor the possibility of failure; it must, in fact, be completely
    absorbed by the one sole idea of performing the determination strongly taken and firmly relied upon. The persons
    must, from time to time, practice this; and as they proceed, they will be able to see how much propinquity exists
    between themselves and the Hazret i Asmâ (God?) and how much they are capable of exercising this power.</p>

  <p>As an example, the author of the Reshihât narrates the following:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In my youth, I was ever with our Lord Molânâ Sa’eed ed Deen Kâshgharee at Hereed. It happened that we, one day,
      walked out together and fell in with an assembly of the inhabitants of the place who were engaged in wrestling. To
      try our powers we agreed to aid with our “powers of the will” one of the wrestlers, so that the other should be
      overcome by him, and after doing so, to change our design in favor of the discomfited individual. So we stopped
      and, turning toward the parties, gave the full influence of our united wills to one, and immediately he was able
      to subdue his opponent. As the person we chose, each in turn, conquered the other, whichever we willed to prevail
      became the most powerful of the two, the power of our own wills was thus clearly manifested.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On another occasion two other persons possessed of these same powers fell in with an assembly of people at a place
    occupied by prize fighters. “To prevent any of the crowd from passing between and separating us we joined our hands
    together. Two persons were engaged fighting; one was a powerful man, while the other was a spare and weak person.
    The former readily overcame the latter; and seeing this I proposed to my companion to aid the weak one by the power
    of our wills. So he bade me aid him in the project, while he concentrated his powers upon the weaker person.
    Immediately a wonderful occurrence took place; the thin, spare man seized his giant-like opponent and threw him on
    the ground with surprising force. The crowd cried out with astonishment as he turned him over on his back and held
    him down with apparent ease. No one present except ourselves knew the cause. Seeing that my companion was much
    affected by the effort which he had made, I bade him remark how perfectly successful we had been, and adding that
    there was no longer any necessity for our remaining there, we walked away.” (Pages 129–132.)</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span></div>

  <p>Many individuals who have seriously wronged and oppressed his friends received punishments through the powers of
    the sheikh. Several instances are related wherein some such even fell sick and died, or were only restored to health
    by open declarations of repentance and imploring his prayerful intercession with God. His spirit seems to have
    accompanied those in whose welfare he took an active interest, and enabled them to commune with him, though far
    distant from him. His power of hearing them was well known to his friends, and several instances are cited to prove
    the fact. His power of affecting the health of those who injured him or his friends was greatly increased while he
    was excited by anger, and on such occasions his whole frame would be convulsed and his beard move about as if moved
    by electricity. On learning details of cruelty done to innocent individuals, the sheikh would be strangely affected,
    so much so that no one dared to address him until the paroxysm was passed; and on such occasions he never failed to
    commune spiritually with the sovereign or prince in such a mysterious manner as to inspire him to deal justly with
    the guilty person and secure his merited punishment.</p>

  <p>Through his “mystical powers” many persons were impressed with the unrighteousness of their course, and, having
    repented of the same, became good and pious and firm believers in his spiritual influences. These powers were always
    connected with his prayers, and it was during these that he was enabled to assure the parties interested of their
    salutary results and the acceptation of their desires. It scarcely needs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_950">
    950</span> to be added, that these prayers were in conformance with Islamism, and were offered up to Allah, whom
    he adored, and to whose supreme will he attributes his powers. He constantly performed the Zikr Jehree, or “audibly
    called God’s name,” and the frequent repetition of this practice fitted him for such holy purposes. Sometimes he
    would affect the mind of the individual upon whom he exercised his powers in such a manner as to throw him into a
    species of trance, after which he could remember nothing that he had previously known, and continued in this state
    until the sheikh chose to restore him to the enjoyment of his ordinary faculties. Notwithstanding all of these
    eminent powers, this great sheikh is reputed to have spent the latter days of his life at Herat in extreme
    indigence, much slighted and neglected by those who had so admired him while in the vigor of his career. All fear of
    his mystical influences seems to have disappeared, and it is narrated that these greatly declined with his ordinary
    strength of mind and body. (Pages 137–139.)</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span></div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Dervish dance.</span>—The exercises which are followed in these halls are of various kinds,
    according to the rules of each institution; but in nearly all they commence by the recital, by the sheikh, of the
    seven mysterious words of which we have spoken. He next chants various passages of the Koran, and at each pause, the
    Dervishes, placed in a circle round the hall, respond in chorus by the word “Allah!” or “Hoo!” In some of the
    societies they sit on their heels, the elbows close to those of each other, and all making simultaneously light
    movements of the head and the body. In others, the movement consists in balancing themselves slowly, from the right
    to the left, and from the left to the right, or inclining the body methodically forward and aft. There are other
    societies in which these motions commence seated, in measured cadences, with a staid countenance, the eyes closed or
    fixed upon the ground, and are continued on foot. These singular exercises are concentrated under the name of
    Murâkebeh (exaltation of the Divine glory), and also under that of the Tevheed (celebration of the Divine unity),
    from which comes the name Tevheed Khâneh, given to the whole of the halls devoted to these religious exercises.</p>

  <p>In some of these institutions—such as the Kâdirees, the Rufâ′ees, the Khalwettees, the Bairâmees, the Gulshenees,
    and the Ushâkees—the exercises are made each holding the other by the hand, putting forward always the right foot
    and increasing at every step the strength of the movement of the body. This is called the Devr, which may be
    translated the “dance” or “rotation.” The duration of these dances is arbitrary—each one is free to leave when he
    pleases. Everyone, however, makes it a point to remain as long as possible. The strongest and most robust of the
    number, and the most enthusiastic, strive to persevere longer than the others; they uncover their heads, take off
    their turbans, form a second circle within the other, entwine their arms within those of their brethren, lean their
    shoulders against each other, gradually raise the voice, and without ceasing repeat “Yâ Allah!” or “Yâ Hoo!”
    increasing each time the movement of the body, and not stopping until their entire strength is exhausted.</p>

  <p>Those of the order of the Rufâ′ees excel in these exercises. They are, moreover, the only ones who use fire in
    their devotions. Their practices embrace nearly all those of the other orders; they are ordinarily divided into five
    different scenes, which last more than three hours, and which are preceded, accompanied, and followed by certain
    ceremonies peculiar to this order. The first commences with praises which all the Dervishes offer to their sheikhs,
    seated before the altar. Four of the more ancient come forward the first, and approach their superior, embrace each
    other as if to give the kiss of peace, and next place themselves two to his right and two to his left. The remainder
    of the Dervishes, in a body, press forward in a procession, all having their arms crossed and their heads inclined.
    Each one, at first, salutes by a profound bow the tablet on which the name of his founder is inscribed. Afterwards,
    putting his two hands over his face and his beard, he kneels before the sheikh, kisses his hand respectfully, and
    then they all go on with a grave step to take their places on the sheepskins, which are spread in a half circle
    around the interior of the hall. So soon as a circle is formed, the Dervishes together chant the Tekbeer and<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_951">951</span> the Fâtiha. Immediately afterwards the sheikh pronounces the words
    “Lâ ilâha ill′ Allah!” and repeats them incessantly; to which the Dervishes repeat “Allah!” balancing themselves
    from side to side, and putting their hands over their faces, on their breasts and their abdomens, and on their
    knees.</p>

  <p>The second scene is opened by the Hamdee Mohammedee, a hymn in honour of the prophet, chanted by one of the elders
    placed on the right of the sheikh. During this chant the Dervishes continue to repeat the word “Allah!” moving,
    however, their bodies forward and aft. A quarter of an hour later they all rise up, approach each other, and press
    their elbows against each other, balancing from right to left and afterwards in a reverse motion, the right foot
    always firm, and the left in a periodical movement, the reverse of that of the body, all observing great precision
    of measure and cadence. In the midst of this exercise they cry out the words “Yâ Allah!” followed by that of “Yâ
    Hoo!” Some of the performers sigh, others sob, some shed tears, others perspire great drops, and all have their eyes
    closed, their faces pale, and the eyes languishing.</p>

  <p>A pause of some minutes is followed by a third scene. It is performed in the middle of an Ilahee, chanted by the
    two elders on the right of the sheikh. The Ilahees, as has already been said, are spiritual cantiques, composed
    almost exclusively in Persian, by sheikhs deceased in the odor of sanctity. The Dervishes then hasten their
    movements, and, to prevent any relaxation, one of the first among them puts himself in their center, and excites
    them by his example. If in the assembly there be any strange Dervishes, which often happens, they give them, through
    politeness, this place of honor; and all fill it successively, the one after the other, shaking themselves as
    aforesaid. The only exception made is in favor of the Mevevees; these never perform any other dance than that
    peculiar to their own order, which consists in turning round on each heel in succession.</p>

  <p>After a new pause commences the fourth scene. Now all the Dervishes take off their turbans, form a circle, bare
    their arms and shoulders against each other, and thus make the circuit of the hall at a measured pace, striking
    their feet at intervals against the floor, and all springing up at once. This dance continues during the Ilahees
    chanted alternately by the two elders to the left of the sheikh. In the midst of this chant the cries of “Yâ Allah!”
    are increased doubly, as also those of “Yâ Hoo!” with frightful howlings, shrieked by the Dervishes together in the
    dance. At the moment that they would seem to stop from sheer exhaustion the sheikh makes a point of exerting them to
    new efforts by walking through their midst, making also himself most violent movements. He is next replaced by the
    two elders, who double the quickness of the step and the agitation of the body; they even straighten themselves up
    from time to time, and excite the envy or emulation of the others in their astonishing efforts to continue the dance
    until their strength is entirely exhausted.</p>

  <p>The fourth scene leads to the last, which is the most frightful of all, the wholly prostrated condition of the
    actors becoming converted into a species of ecstasy which they call Halet. It is in the midst of this abandonment of
    self, or rather of religious delirium, that they make use of red-hot irons. Several cutlasses and other instruments
    of sharp-pointed iron are suspended in the niches of the hall, and upon a part of the wall to the right of the
    sheikh. Near the close of the fourth scene two Dervishes take down eight or nine of these instruments, heat them red
    hot, and present them to the sheikh. He, after reciting some prayers over them, and invoking the founder of the
    order, Ahmed er Rufâ′ee, breathes over them, and raising them slightly to the mouth, gives them to the Dervishes,
    who ask for them with the greatest eagerness. Then it is that these fanatics, transported by frenzy, seize upon
    these irons, gloat upon them tenderly, lick them, bite them, hold them between their teeth, and end by cooling them
    in their mouths. Those who are unable to procure any seize upon the cutlasses hanging on the wall with fury, and
    stick them into their sides, arms, and legs.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the fury of their frenzy, and to the amazing boldness which they deem a merit in the eyes of the
    Divinity, all stoically bear up against the pain which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_952">952</span>
    experience with apparent gaiety. If, however, some of them fall under their sufferings, they throw themselves into
    the arms of their confrères, but without a complaint or the least sign of pain. Some minutes after this, the sheikh
    walks round the hall, visits each one of the performers in turn, breathes upon their wounds, rubs them with saliva,
    recites prayers over them, and promises them speedy cures. It is said that twenty-four hours afterward nothing is to
    be seen of their wounds. (Pages 218–222.)</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span></div>

  <p>There was no regularity in their dancing, but each seemed to be performing the antics of a madman; now moving his
    body up and down; the next moment turning round, then using odd gesticulations with his arms, next jumping, and
    sometimes screaming; in short, if a stranger observing them was not told that this was the involuntary effect of
    enthusiastic excitement, he would certainly think that these Durweeshes were merely striving to excel one another in
    playing the buffoon. (Page 260.)</p>

  <div class="center">*<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span></div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The fit.</span>—After this preface, the performers began the Zikr. Sitting in the manner above
    described, they chanted, in slow measure, <i>Lá iláha illa ’lláh</i> (there is no deity but God), to the following
    air: <i>Lá i-lá hailla-lláh. Lá i-lá-ha-illa-l-lá-h. Lá i-lá ha illa-l-láh.</i> Bowing the head twice on each
    repetition of “<i>Lá iláha illa ’lláh</i>.” Thus they continued about a quarter of an hour, and then, for about the
    same space of time, they repeated the same words to the same air, but in a quicker measure, and with correspondingly
    quicker motion....</p>

  <p>They next rose, and, standing in the same order in which they had been sitting, repeated the same words to another
    air. During this stage of their performance they were joined by a tall, well-dressed, black slave, whose appearance
    induced me to inquire who he was. I was informed that he was a eunuch, belonging to the basha. The Zikkeers, still
    standing, next repeated the same words in a very deep and hoarse tone, laying the principal emphasis upon the word
    “Lá,” and the first syllable of the last word, Allah, and uttering, apparently with a considerable effort. The sound
    much resembled that which is produced by beating the rim of a tambourine. Each Zikkeer turned his head alternately
    to the right and left at each repetition of “<i>Lá iláha illa ’lláh</i>.” The eunuch above mentioned, during this
    part of the Zikr, became what is termed <i>melboos</i>, or “possessed.” Throwing his arms about, and looking up with
    a very wild expression of countenance, he exclaimed, in a very high tone and with great vehemence and rapidity,
    <i>Allah! Allah! Allah! Allah! Allah! la! la! la! la! la! la! la! la! la! la! la! la! láh! Yá‛ammee! Yá‛ammee!
    Yá‛ammee! Ashmáwee! Yá Ashmáwee! Yá Ashmáwee!</i> (<i>Yá‛ammee</i> signifies O, my uncle!) His voice gradually
    became faint, and when he had uttered those words, though he was held by a Durweesh who was next him, he fell on the
    ground, foaming at the mouth, his eyes closed, his limbs convulsed, and his fingers clenched over his thumbs. It was
    an epileptic fit. No one could see it and believe it to be the effect of feigned emotions; it was undoubtedly the
    result of a high state of religious excitement. Nobody seemed surprised at it, for occurrences of this kind at Zikrs
    are not uncommon. All the performers now appeared much excited, repeating their ejaculations with greater rapidity,
    violently turning their heads, and sinking the whole body at the same time, some of them jumping. The eunuch became
    <i>melboos</i> again several times, and I generally remarked that his fits happened after one of the Moonshids had
    sung a line or two, and exerted himself more than usually to excite his hearers. The singing was, indeed, to my
    taste, very pleasing. Toward the close of the Zikr a private soldier, who had joined through the whole performance,
    also seemed several times to be <i>melboos</i>, growling in a horrible manner and violently shaking his head from
    side to side. The contrast presented by the vehement and distressing exertions of the performers at the close of the
    Zikr, and their calm gravity and solemnity of manner at the commencement, was particularly striking. Money was
    collected during the performance for the Moonshid. The Zikkeers receive no pay. (Pages 252–255.)</p>

  </div>

  <h3 id="Arapaho_intro">INTRODUCTORY</h3>

  <p>The Ghost-dance songs are of the utmost importance in connection with the study of the messiah religion, as we find
    embodied in them much of the doctrine itself, with more of the special tribal mythologies, together with such
    innumerable references to old-time customs, ceremonies, and modes of life long since obsolete as make up a regular
    symposium of aboriginal thought and practice. There is no limit to the number of these songs, as every trance at
    every dance produces a new one, the trance subject after regaining consciousness embodying his experience in the
    spirit world in the form of a song, which is sung at the next dance and succeeding performances until superseded by
    other songs originating in the same way. Thus, a single dance may easily result in twenty or thirty new songs. While
    songs are thus born and die, certain ones which appeal especially to the Indian heart, on account of their
    mythology, pathos, or peculiar sweetness, live and are perpetuated. There are also with each tribe certain songs
    which are a regular part of the ceremonial, as the opening song and the closing song, which are repeated at every
    dance. Of these the closing song is the most important and permanent. In some cases certain songs constitute a
    regular series, detailing the experiences of the same person in successive trance visions. First in importance, for
    number, richness of reference, beauty of sentiment, and rhythm of language, are the songs of the Arapaho.</p>

  <h4 id="Arapaho_sketch">SKETCH OF THE TRIBE</h4>

  <p>The Arapaho, with their subtribe, the Gros Ventres, are one of the westernmost tribes of the wide-extending
    Algonquian stock. According to their oldest traditions they formerly lived in northeastern Minnesota and moved
    westward in company with the Cheyenne, who at that time lived on the Cheyenne fork of Red river. From the earliest
    period the two tribes have always been closely confederated, so that they have no recollection of a time when they
    were not allies. In the westward migration the Cheyenne took a more southerly direction toward the country of the
    Black hills, while the Arapaho continued more nearly westward up the Missouri. The Arapaho proper probably ascended
    on the southern side of the river, while the Gros Ventres went up the northern bank and finally drifted off toward
    the Blackfeet, with whom they have ever since been closely associated, although they have on several occasions made
    long visits, extending sometimes over several years, to their southern relatives, by whom they are still regarded as
    a part of the “Inûna-ina.” The others continued on to the great divide between the waters of the Missouri and those
    of the Columbia, then turning southward along the mountains, separated finally into two main divisions, the northern
    Arapaho continuing to occupy the head streams of the Missouri and the Yellowstone, in Montana and Wyoming, while the
    southern Arapaho made their camps on the head of the Platte, the Arkansas, and the Canadian, in Colorado and the
    adjacent states, frequently joining the Comanche and Kiowa in their raids far down into Mexico. From their earliest
    recollection, until put on reservations, they have been at war with the Shoshoni, Ute, Pawnee, and Navaho, but have
    generally been friendly with their other neighbors. The southern Arapaho and Cheyenne have usually acted in concert
    with the Comanche, Kiowa, and Kiowa Apache.</p>

  <p>They recognize among themselves five original divisions, each having a different dialect. They are here given in
    the order of their importance:</p>

  <p>1. <i>Na′kasinĕ′na</i>, <i>Ba′achinĕna</i> or <i>Northern Arapaho</i>. Nakasinĕna, “sagebrush men,” is the original
    name of this portion of the tribe and the divisional name used by themselves. The name Baachinĕna, by which they are
    commonly known to the rest of the tribe, is more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_955">955</span> modern and may
    mean “red willow (i.&nbsp;e., kinikinik) men,” or possibly “blood-pudding men,” the latter meaning said to have been an
    allusion to a kind of sausage formerly made by this band. They are commonly known as northern Arapaho, to
    distinguish them from the other large division living now in Oklahoma. The Kiowa distinguished them as Tägyä′ko,
    “sagebrush people,” a translation of their proper name, Baachinĕna. Although not the largest division, the
    Baachinĕna claim to be the “mother people” of the Arapaho, and have in their keeping the grand medicine of the
    tribe, the sĕicha or sacred pipe.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Na′wunĕna</i>, “southern men,” or <i>Southern Arapaho</i>, called <i>Nawathi′nĕha</i>, “southerners,” by the
    northern Arapaho. This latter is said to be the archaic form. The southern Arapaho, living now in Oklahoma,
    constitute by far the larger division, although subordinate in the tribal sociology to the northern Arapaho. In
    addition to their everyday dialect, they are said to have an archaic dialect, some words of which approximate
    closely to Cheyenne.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Aä′ninĕna</i>, <i>Hitu′nĕna</i>, or <i>Gros Ventres of the Prairie</i>. The first name, said to mean “white
    clay people” (from <i>aäti</i>, “white clay”), is that by which they call themselves. Hitunĕna or Hitunĕnina,
    “begging men,” “beggars,” or, more exactly, “spongers,” is the name by which they are called by the other Arapaho,
    on account, as these latter claim, of their propensity for filling their stomachs at the expense of someone else.
    The same idea is intended to be conveyed by the tribal sign, which signifies “belly people,” not “big bellies” (Gros
    Ventres), as rendered by the French Canadian trappers. The Kiowa call them Bot-k̔iñ′ago, “belly men.” By the
    Shoshoni, also, they are known as Sä′pani, “bellies,” while the Blackfeet call them Atsina, “gut people.” The Ojibwa
    call them Bahwetegow-ēninnewug, “fall people,” according to Tanner, whence they have sometimes been called Fall
    Indians or Rapid Indians, from their former residence about the rapids of the Saskatchewan. To the Sioux they are
    known as Sku′tani. Lewis and Clark improperly call them “Minnetarees of Fort de Prairie.” The Hidatsa or Minitari
    are sometimes known as Gros Ventres of the Missouri.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Bä′sawunĕ′na</i>, “wood lodge men,” or, according to another authority, “big lodge people.” These were
    formerly a distinct tribe and at war with the other Arapaho. They are represented as having been a very foolish
    people in the old times, and many absurd stories are told of them, in agreement with the general Indian practice of
    belittling conquered or subordinate tribes. They have been incorporated with the northern Arapaho for at least a
    hundred and fifty years, according to the statements of the oldest men of that band. Their dialect is said to have
    differed very considerably from the other Arapaho dialects. There are still about one hundred of this lineage among
    the northern Arapaho, and perhaps a few others with the two other main divisions. Weasel Bear, the present keeper of
    the sacred pipe, is of the Bäsawunĕna.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_956">956</span></p>

  <p>5. <i>Ha’nahawunĕna</i> or <i>Aanû’hawă</i> (meaning unknown). These, like the Bäsawunĕna, lived with the northern
    Arapaho, but are now practically extinct.</p>

  <p class="p2">There seems to be no possible trace of a clan or gentile system among the Arapaho, and the same remark holds good
    of the Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Comanche. It was once assumed that all Indian tribes had the clan system, but later
    research shows that it is lacking over wide areas in the western territory. It is very doubtful if it exists at all
    among the prairie tribes generally. Mr Ben Clark, who has known and studied the Cheyenne for half a lifetime, states
    positively that they have no clans, as the term is usually understood. This agrees with the result of personal
    investigations and the testimony of George Bent, a Cheyenne half-blood, and the best living authority on all that
    relates to his tribe. With the eastern tribes, however, and those who have removed from the east or the timbered
    country, as the Caddo, the gentile system is so much a part of their daily life that it is one of the first things
    to attract the attention of the observer.</p>

  <p>In regard to the tribal camping circle, common to most of the prairie tribes, the Arapaho state that on account of
    their living in three main divisions they have had no common camping circle within their recollection, but that each
    of these three divisions constituted a single circle when encamped in one place.</p>

  <p>Among the northern Arapaho, on the occasion of every grand gathering, the sacred pipe occupied a special large tipi
    in the center of the circle, and the taking down of this tipi by the medicine keeper was the signal to the rest of
    the camp to prepare to move. On the occasion of a visit of several hundred Cheyenne and Arapaho to the Kiowa and
    Comanche at Anadarko, in the summer of 1892, each of the visiting tribes camped in a separate circle adjacent to the
    other. The opening of the circle, like the door of each tipi, always faces the east.</p>

  <p>Under the name of Kanenăvish the Arapaho proper are mentioned by Lewis and Clark in 1805, as living southwest of
    the Black hills. As a tribe they have not been at war with the whites since 1868, and took no part in the outbreak
    of the Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Comanche in 1874. At present they are in three main divisions. First come the Gros
    Ventres, numbering 718 in 1892, associated with the Asiniboin on Fort Belknap reservation in Montana. There are
    probably others of this band with the Blackfeet on the British side of the line. Next come the northern Arapaho,
    numbering 829, associated with the Shoshoni on Wind River reservation in Wyoming. They were placed on this
    reservation in 1876, after having made peace with the Shoshoni, their hereditary enemy, in 1869. They are divided
    into three bands, the “Forks of the River Men” under Black Coal, the head chief of the whole division; the “Bad
    Pipes” under Short Nose, and the “Greasy Faces” under Spotted Horse. The third division, the southern Arapaho,
    associated with the Cheyenne in Oklahoma, constitute the main body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_957">
    957</span> of the tribe and numbered 1,091 in 1892. They have five bands: 1, Wa′quithi, “bad faces,” the
    principal band and the one to which the head chief, Left Hand, belongs; 2, Aqa′thinĕ′na, “pleasant men;” 3,
    Gawunĕ′na or Ga′wunĕhäna (Kawinahan, “black people”—<i>Hayden</i>), “Blackfeet,” so called because said to be of
    part Blackfoot blood, the same name being applied to the Blackfoot tribe; 4, Ha′qihana, “wolves,” because they had a
    wolf (not coyote) for medicine; 5, Säsa′bä-ithi, “looking up,” or according to another authority, “looking around,
    i.&nbsp;e., watchers or lookouts.” Under the treaty of Medicine Lodge in 1867, they and the southern Cheyenne were placed
    on the reservation which they sold in 1890 to take allotments and become citizens. Their present chief is Left Hand
    (Nawat), who succeeded the celebrated Little Raven (Hosa) a few years ago. The whole number of the Arapaho and Gros
    Ventres, including a few in eastern schools, is about 2,700.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Until very recently the Arapaho have been a typical prairie tribe, living in skin tipis and following the buffalo
    in its migrations, yet they retain a tradition of a time when they were agricultural. They are of a friendly,
    accommodating disposition, religious and contemplative, without the truculent, pugnacious character that belongs to
    their confederates, the Cheyenne, although they have always proven themselves brave warriors. They are also less
    mercenary and more tractable than the prairie Indians generally, and having now recognized the inevitable of
    civilization have gone to work in good faith to make the best of it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_958">
    958</span> Their religious nature has led them to take a more active interest in the Ghost dance, which, together
    with the rhythmic character of their language, has made the Arapaho songs the favorite among all the tribes of
    Oklahoma. The chief study of the Ghost dance was made among the Arapaho, whom the author visited six times for this
    purpose. One visit was made to those in Wyoming, the rest of the time being spent with the southern branch of the
    tribe.</p>

  <p>This opening song of the Arapaho Ghost dance originated among the northern Arapaho in Wyoming and was brought down
    to the southern branch of the tribe by the first apostles of the new religion. By “another pipe” is probably meant
    the newer revelation of the messiah, the pipe being an important feature of all sacred ceremonies, and all<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_959">959</span> their previous religious tradition, having centered about the sĕicha
    or flat pipe, to be described hereafter. The pipe, however, was not commonly carried in the dance, as was the case
    among the Sioux. In this song, as in many others of the Ghost dance, the father or messiah, <i>Hesûna′nin</i>, is
    supposed to be addressing “my children,” <i>nänisa′na</i>. The tune is particularly soft and pleasing, and the song
    remains a standard favorite. The second reference is to the new earth which is supposed to be already moving rapidly
    forward to slide over and take the place of this old and worn-out creation.</p>

  <p>The sĕicha or flat pipe is the sacred tribal medicine of the Arapaho. According to the myth it was given to their
    ancestors at the beginning of the world after the Turtle had brought the earth up from under the water. It was
    delivered to them by the Duck, which was discovered swimming about on the top of the water after the emergence of
    the land. At the same time they were given an ear of corn, from which comes all the corn of the world. The Arapaho
    lost the art of agriculture when they came out upon the buffalo plains, but the sacred pipe the Turtle long since
    changed to stone, and the first ear of corn, also transformed to stone, they have cherished to this day as their
    great medicine. The pipe, turtle, and ear of corn are preserved among the northern Arapaho in Wyoming, who claim to
    be the “mother people” of the tribe. They are handed down in the keeping of a particular family from generation to
    generation, the present priestly guardian being Se′hiwûq, “Weasel Bear” (from <i>sea</i>, weasel, and <i>wûq</i>,
    bear; the name has also been rendered “Gray Bear,” from <i>se</i>, gray, and <i>wûq</i>, bear), of the Bäsawunĕ′na
    division.</p>

  <p>The three sacred things are preserved carefully wrapped in deerskins, and are exposed only on rare occasions,
    always within the sacred tipi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_960">960</span> and in the presence of but a small
    number of witnesses, who take this opportunity to smoke the sacred pipe and pray for the things which they most
    desire. The pipe itself is of stone, and is described as apparently made in double, one part being laid over the
    other like the bark of a tree, the outer part of both bowl and stem being of the regular red pipestone, while the
    inner part of both is of white stone. The stem is only about 10 inches long, while the bowl is large and heavy, with
    the characteristic projection for resting the end upon the ground. Both bowl and stem are rounded, but with a flange
    of perhaps an inch in width along each side of the stem and up along the bowl. From this comes its name of sĕicha,
    or “flat pipe.” When exposed on such occasions, the devotees sit around the fire in a circle, when the bundle is
    opened upon the ground so that all may see the sacred objects. The medicine keeper then lights the pipe and after
    taking one or two whiffs passes it to the one next him, who takes a single whiff and passes it on to the next. It
    thus goes sunwise (?) around the circle. In taking the sĕicha the devotees do not grasp the stem, as when smoking on
    other occasions, but receive it upon the outstretched palm of the right hand, smoke, and pass it on around the
    circle. The flanges along the side of the pipe allow it to rest flat upon the hand. After all have smoked, the
    priest recites the genesis myth of the origin of the land, and the manner in which the pipe and the corn were given
    to their ancestors. The corresponding myth of the Cheyenne occupies “four smokes” (i.&nbsp;e., four consecutive nights)
    in the delivery, but I am unable to state whether or not this is the case with the Arapaho. So sacred is this
    tradition held that no one but the priest of the pipe dares to recite it, for fear of divine punishment should the
    slightest error be made in the narration. At the close of the recital the devotees send up their prayers for the
    blessings of which they stand most in need, after which the priest again carefully wraps up the sacred objects in
    the skins. Before leaving the lodge the worshipers cover the bundle with their offerings of blankets or other
    valuables, which are taken by the medicine keeper as his fee.</p>

  <p>When encamped in the tribal circle, the sacred pipe and its keeper occupied a large tipi, reserved especially for
    this purpose, which was set up within the circle and near its western line, directly opposite the doorway on the
    east. In the center of the circle, between the doorway and the sacred tipi, was erected the sweat-house of the
    <i>Chi′nachichinĕ′na</i> or old men of the highest degree of the warrior order. The taking down of the sacred tipi
    by the attendants of the pipe keeper was the signal for moving camp, and no other tipi was allowed to be taken down
    before it. When on the march, the pipe keeper proceeded on foot—never on horse—carrying the sacred bundle upon his
    back and attended by a retinue of guards. As a matter of course, the sacred pipe was not carried by war parties or
    on other expeditions requiring celerity of movement. Of late years the rules have<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_961">961</span> so far relaxed that its present guardian sometimes rides on horseback while carrying
    the pipe, but even then he carries the bundle upon his own back instead of upon the saddle. He never rides in a
    wagon with it. Since the tribe is permanently divided under the modern reservation system, individuals or small
    parties of the southern Arapaho frequently make the long journey by railroad and stage to the reservation in Wyoming
    in order to see and pray over the sĕicha, as it is impossible, on account of the ceremonial regulations, for the
    keeper to bring it down to them in the south.</p>

  <p>So far as known, only one white man, Mr J. Roberts, formerly superintendent of the Arapaho school in Wyoming, has
    ever seen the sacred pipe, which was shown to him on one occasion by Weasel Bear as a special mark of gratitude in
    return for some kindness. After having spent several months among the southern Arapaho, from whom I learned the
    songs of the pipe with much as to its sacred history, I visited the messiah in Nevada and then went to the northern
    Arapaho in Wyoming, with great hope of seeing the sĕicha and hearing the tradition in full. On the strength of my
    intimate acquaintance with their relatives in the south and with their great messiah in the west, the chiefs and
    head-men were favorable to my purpose and encouraged me to hope, but on going out to the camp in the mountains,
    where nearly the whole tribe was then assembled cutting wood, my hopes were dashed to the ground the first night by
    hearing the old priest, Weasel Bear, making the public announcement in a loud voice throughout the camp that a white
    man was among them to learn about their sacred things, but that these belonged to the religion of the Indian and a
    white man had no business to ask about them. The chief and those who had been delegates to the messiah came in soon
    after to the tipi where I was stopping, to express their deep regret, but they were unable to change the resolution
    of Weasel Bear, and none of themselves would venture to repeat the tradition.</p>

    signifies literally, expert, skillful, or wise.</p>

  <p><i>Chi′chita′nĕ</i> is a favorite game of contest with the boys, in which the player, while holding in his hands a
    bow and an arrow ready to shoot, keeps in the hand which grasps the string a small wisp of grass bound with sinew.
    He lets this drop and tries to shoot it with the arrow before it touches the ground. The wisp is about the size of a
    man’s finger.</p>

  <p>The song came from the north, and was suggested by a trance vision in which the dreamer saw his former boy friends
    playing this game in the spirit world.</p>

    into a large Arapaho camp, where he met his dead father, who took him around to the various tipis to meet others of
    his departed friends. While they were thus going about, a change came o’er the spirit of his dream, as so often
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_963">963</span>happens in this fevered mental condition, and instead of his
    father he found a moose standing by his side. Such transformations are frequently noted in the Ghost-dance songs.</p>

  <p>The bed of the prairie tribes is composed of slender willow rods, peeled, straightened with the teeth, laid side by
    side and fastened together into a sort of mat by means of buckskin or rawhide strings passed through holes at the
    ends of the rods. The bed is stretched upon a platform raised about a foot above the ground, and one end of the mat
    is raised up in hammock fashion by means of a tripod and buckskin hanger. The rods laid across the platform, forming
    the bed proper, are usually about 3½ or 4 feet long (the width of the bed), while those forming the upright
    part suspended from the tripod are shorter as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_964">964</span> approach the
    top, where they are only about half that length. The bed is bordered with buckskin binding fringed and beaded, and
    the exposed rods are painted in bright colors. The hanging portion is distinct from the part resting upon the
    platform, and in some cases there is a hanger at each end of the bed. Over the platform portion are spread the
    buckskins and blankets, which form a couch by day and a bed by night. A pillow of buckskin, stuffed with buffalo
    hair and elaborately ornamented with beads or porcupine quills, is sometimes added. The bed is placed close up under
    the tipi. In the largest tipis there are usually three beds, one being opposite the doorway and the others on each
    side, the fire being built in a hole scooped out in the ground in the center of the lodge. They are used as seats
    during waking hours, while the ground, with a rawhide spread upon it, constitutes the only table at meal time
    (<a href="#plate_cxxi">plate <span class="smcap">cxxi</span></a>; <a href="#fig_89">figure 89</a>).
    In going to bed there is no undressing, each person as he becomes
    sleepy simply stretching out and drawing a blanket over himself, head and all, while the other occupants of the tipi
    continue their talking, singing, or other business until they too lie down to pleasant dreams.</p>

  <p>This is another of the old favorites. The rolling effect of the vocalic Arapaho syllables renders it particularly
    sonorous when sung by a full chorus. <i>Ni′qa</i> or <i>a-ni′qu</i>, “father,” is a term of reverential affection,
    about equivalent to “our father” in the Lord’s prayer. The ordinary word is <i>hesûna′nin</i>, from <i>nisû′na</i>,

  <p>The cottonwood (<i>Populus monilifera</i>) is the most characteristic tree of the plains and of the arid region
    between the Rockies and the Sierras. It is a species of poplar and takes its name from the white downy blossom
    fronds, resembling cotton, which come out upon it in the spring. The cottonwood and a species of stunted oak, with
    the mesquite in the south, are almost the only trees to be found upon the great plains extending from the
    Saskatchewan southward into Texas. As it never grows out upon the open, but always close along the borders of the
    few streams, it is an unfailing indication of water either on or near the surface, in a region well-nigh waterless.
    Between the bark and the wood there is a sweet milky juice of which the Indians are very fond—as one who had been
    educated in the east said, “It is their ice cream”—and they frequently strip off the bark and scrape the trunk in
    order to procure it. Horses also are fond of this sweet juice, and in seasons when the grass has been burned off or
    is otherwise scarce, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_968">968</span> Indian ponies sometimes resort to the
    small twigs and bark of the cottonwood to sustain life. In extreme cases their owners have sometimes been driven to
    the same shift. In winter the camps of the prairie tribes are removed from the open prairie to the shelter of the
    cottonwood timber along the streams. The tree is held almost sacred, and the sun-dance lodge is usually or always
    constructed of cottonwood saplings.</p>

  <p>Among the Algonquian tribes of the east, the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, Comanche, and prairie tribes
    generally, as well as among those of the northwest coast and some parts of Mexico, thunder and lightning are
    produced by a great bird, whose shadow is the thunder cloud, whose flapping wings make the sound of thunder, and
    whose flashing eyes rapidly opening or closing send forth the lightning. Among some tribes of the northwest this
    being is not a bird, but a giant who puts on a dress of bird skin with head, wings, and all complete, by means of
    which he flies through the air when in search of his prey. The myth is not found among the Iroquois or the Cherokee,
    or, perhaps, among the Muskhogean tribes.</p>

  <p>The Thunderbird usually has his dwelling on some high mountain or rocky elevation of difficult access. Within the
    territory of the myth several places are thus designated as the Thunder’s Nest. Thunder bay of Lake Huron, in lower
    Michigan, derives its name in this way. Such a place, known to the Sioux as <i>Waqkiñ′a-oye′</i>, “The Thunder’s
    Nest,” is within the old territory of the Sisseton Sioux in eastern South Dakota in the neighborhood of Big Stone
    lake. At another place, near the summit of the Coteau des Prairies, in eastern South Dakota, a number of large round
    bowlders are pointed out as the eggs of the Thunderbird. According to the Comanche there is a place on upper Red
    river where the Thunderbird once alighted on the ground, the spot being still identified by the fact that the grass
    remains burned off over a space having the outline of a large bird with outstretched wings. The same<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_969">969</span> people tell how a hunter once shot and wounded a large bird which
    fell to the ground. Being afraid to attack it alone on account of its size, he returned to camp for help, but on
    again approaching the spot the hunters heard the thunder rolling and saw flashes of lightning shooting out from the
    ravine where the bird lay wounded. On coming nearer, the lightning blinded them so that they could not see the bird,
    and one flash struck and killed a hunter. His frightened companions then fled back to camp, for they knew it was the
    Thunderbird.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>With both Cheyenne and Arapaho the thunder (<i>ba′a′</i>) is a large bird, with a brood of smaller ones, and
    carries in its talons a number of arrows with which it strikes the victim of lightning. For this reason they call
    the eagle on our coins <i>baa</i>. When it thunders, they say <i>ba′a′ nänitŭ′hut</i>, “the thunder calls.” In
    Indian pictography the Thunderbird is figured with zigzag lines running out from its heart to represent the
    lightning. A small figure of it (represented in <a href="#fig_92">figure 92</a>), cut from rawhide and ornamented with beads, is
    frequently worn on the heads of the dancers.</p>

  <p>This song probably refers to the Thunderbird. There is an energetic swing to the tune that makes it a favorite. In
    Indian belief the earth is a circular disk, usually surrounded on all sides by water, and the sky is a solid concave
    hemisphere coming down at the horizon to the level of the earth. In Cherokee and other Indian myth the sky is
    continually lifting up and coming down again to the earth, like the upper blade of the scissors. The sun, which
    lives upon the outside of this hemisphere, comes through from the east in the morning while there is a momentary
    opening between the earth and the edge of the sky, climbs along upon the underside of the sky from east to west, and
    goes out at the western horizon in the evening, to return during the night to its starting point in the east.</p>

  <p>This song was composed by Paul Boynton (Bääku′ni, “Red Feather”), a Carlisle student, after having been in a
    trance. His brother had died some time before, and being told by the Indians that he might<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_972">972</span> be able to see and talk with him by joining the dance, Paul went to Sitting Bull,
    the leader of the dance, at the next gathering, and asked him to help him to see his dead brother. The result was
    that he was hypnotized by Sitting Bull, fell to the ground in a trance, and saw his brother. While talking with him,
    however, he suddenly awoke, much to his regret, probably from some one of the dancers having touched against him as
    he lay upon the ground. According to his statement, the words were spoken by him in his sleep after coming from the
    dance and were overheard by some companions who questioned him about it in the morning, when he told his experience
    and put the words into a song. The “father” here referred to is Sitting Bull, the great apostle of the Arapaho Ghost
    dance. It was from Paul’s statement, intelligently told in good English before I had yet seen the dance, that I was
    first led to suspect that hypnotism was the secret of the trances.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The author of this song saw her children in the other world playing with the <i>hätiku′tha</i>, or hummer. On going
    home after awaking from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_975">975</span> her trance, she made the toy and carried
    it with her to the next dance and twirled it in the air while singing the song. The <i>hätiku′tha</i>, or hummer, is
    used by the boys of the prairie tribes as our boys use the “cut-water,” a circular tin disk, suspended on two
    strings passed through holes in the middle, and set in rapid revolution, so as to produce a humming sound, by
    alternately twisting the strings upon each other and allowing them to untwist again. One of these which I examined
    consists of a bone from a buffalo hoof, painted in different colors, with four buckskin strings tied around the
    middle and running out on each side and fastened at each end to a small peg, so as to be more firmly grasped by the
    fingers. It was carried in the dance in 1890 by an old Arapaho named Tall Bear, who had had it in his possession for
    twenty years. Another specimen, shown in <a href="#fig_93">figure 93</a>, <i>a</i>, now in possession of the National Museum, is similar
    in construction, but with only one string on each side.</p>

  <p>A kindred toy—it can hardly be considered a musical instrument—is that known among the whites as the “bull-roarer.”
    It is found among most of the western tribes, as well as among our own children and primitive peoples all over the
    world. It is usually a simple flat piece of wood, about 6 inches long, sometimes notched on the edges and fancifully
    painted, attached to a sinew or buckskin string of convenient length. It is held in one hand, and when twirled
    rapidly in the air produces a sound not unlike the roaring of a bull or of distant thunder. With most tribes it is
    simply a child’s toy, but among the Hopi, according to Fewkes, and the Apache, according to Bourke, it has a sacred
    use to assist the prayers of the medicine-man in bringing on the storm clouds and the rain.</p>

  <p>In the mythology of many primitive nations, from the ancient Hindu to our own Indian tribes, the turtle or tortoise
    is the supporter of the earth, the Atlas on whose back rests the burden of the whole living universe. A reason for
    this is found in the amphibious character of the turtle, which renders it equally at home on land and in the water,
    and in its peculiar shape, which was held to be typical of the world, the world itself being conceived as a huge
    turtle swimming in a limitless ocean, the dome of the sky being its upper shell, and the flat surface of the earth
    being the bony breastplate of the animal, while inclosed between them was the living body, the human, animal, and
    vegetal creation. In Hindu mythology, when the gods are ready to destroy mankind, the turtle will grow weary and
    sink under his load and then the waters will rise and a deluge will overwhelm the earth. (<i>Fiske.</i>)</p>

  <p>The belief in the turtle as the upholder of the earth was common to all the Algonquian tribes, to which belong the
    Arapaho and Cheyenne, and to the northern Iroquoian tribes. Earthquakes were caused by his shifting his position
    from time to time. In their pictographs the turtle was frequently the symbol of the earth, and in their prayers it
    was sometimes addressed as mother. The most honored clan was the Turtle clan; the most sacred spot in the Algonquian
    territory was Mackinaw, the “Island of the Great Turtle;” the favorite medicine bowl of their doctors is the shell
    of a turtle; the turtle is pictured on the ghost shirts of the Arapaho, and farther south in Oklahoma it is the
    recognized stock brand by which it is known that a horse or cow belongs to one of the historic Delaware tribe.</p>

  <p>This is the most pathetic of the Ghost-dance songs. It is sung to a plaintive tune, sometimes with tears rolling
    down the cheeks of the dancers as the words would bring up thoughts of their present miserable and dependent
    condition. It may be considered the Indian paraphrase of the Lord’s prayer.</p>

  <p>The meaning of this song is not clear. It may refer to the Thunderbird or to the Crow, the sacred bird of the Ghost
    dance. The <i>ye′nis</i> or wild rose is much esteemed among the prairie tribes for its red seed berries, which are
    pounded into a paste and dried for food. It is frequently mentioned in the ghost songs, and is sometimes pictured on
    the ghost shirts. Although rather insipid, the berries possess nutritive qualities. They are gathered in winter, and
    are sometimes eaten raw, but more generally are first boiled and strained to get rid of the seeds. This dough-like
    substance is sometimes mixed with marrow from broken bones and pasted around sticks and thus roasted before the
    fire. It is never packed away for future use. The Cherokee call the same plant by a name which means “rabbit food,”
    on account of this animal’s fondness for the berries.</p>

  <p>This is another song about the whites, who are spoken of as “yellow hides” or “white skins.” The proper Arapaho
    name for a white man is <i>Nia′tha</i>, “skillful.” A great many names are applied to the whites by the different
    Indian tribes. By the Comanche, Shoshoni, and Paiute they are called <i>Tai′vo</i>, “easterners;” by the Hopi, of
    the same stock as the three tribes mentioned, they are known as <i>Paha′na</i>, “eastern water people;” by the Kiowa
    they are called <i>Be′dălpago</i>, “hairy mouths,” or <i>Ta‛ka′-i</i>, “standing ears.” It is very doubtful if the
    “pale face” of romance ever existed in the Indian mind.</p>

  <p>The Kiowa, the Sioux, and perhaps some other tribes performed the Ghost dance around a tree set up in the center of
    the circle. With the Kiowa this tree was a cedar, and such was probably the case with the other tribes, whenever a
    cedar could be obtained, as it is always a sacred tree in Indian belief and ceremonial. The southern Arapaho and
    Cheyenne never had a tree in connection with the Ghost dance, so that this song could not have originated among
    them. The cedar is held sacred for its evergreen foliage, its fragrant smell, its red heart wood, and the durable
    character of its timber. On account of its fine grain, and enduring qualities the prairie tribes make their tipi
    poles of its wood, which will not warp through heat or moisture. Their flageolets or flutes are also made of cedar,
    and in the mescal and other ceremonies its dried and crumbled foliage is thrown upon the fire as incense. In
    Cherokee and Yuchi myth the red color of the wood comes from the blood of a wizard who was killed and decapitated by
    a hero, and whose head was hung in the top of several trees in succession, but continued to live until, by the
    advice of a medicine-man, the people hung it in the topmost branches of a cedar tree, where it finally died. The
    blood of the severed head trickled down the trunk of the tree and thus the wood was stained.</p>

  <p>From the buffalo they had food, fuel, dress, shelter, and domestic furniture, shields for defense, points for their
    arrows, and strings for their bows. As the old Spanish chronicles of Coronado put it: “To be short, they make so
    many things of them as they have need of, or as many as suffice them in the use of this life.”</p>

  <p>Among Indians the professions of medicine and religion are inseparable. The doctor is always a priest, and the
    priest is always a doctor. Hence, to the whites in the Indian country the Indian priest-doctor has come to be known
    as the “medicine-man,” and anything sacred, mysterious, or of wonderful power or efficacy in Indian life or belief
    is designated as “medicine,” this term being the nearest equivalent of the aboriginal expression in the various
    languages. To “make medicine” is to perform some sacred ceremony, from the curing of a sick child to the
    consecration of the sun-dance lodge. Among the prairie tribes the great annual tribal ceremony was commonly known as
    the “medicine dance,” and the special guardian deity of every warrior was spoken of as his “medicine.”</p>

  <p>The buffalo was to the nomad hunters of the plains what corn was to the more sedentary tribes of the east and
    south—the living, visible symbol of their support and existence; the greatest gift of a higher being to his
    children. Something of the buffalo entered into every important ceremony. In the medicine dance—or sun dance, as it
    is frequently called—the head and skin of a buffalo hung from the center pole of the lodge, and in the fearful
    torture that accompanied this dance among some tribes, the dancers dragged around the circle buffalo skulls tied to
    ropes which were fastened to skewers driven through holes cut in their bodies and limbs. A buffalo skull is placed
    in front of the sacred sweat-lodge, and on the battlefield of Wounded Knee I have seen buffalo skulls and plates of
    dried meat placed at the head of the graves. The buffalo was the sign of the Creator on earth as the sun was his
    glorious manifestation in the heavens. The hair of the buffalo was an important element in the preparation of
    “medicine,” whether for war, hunting, love, or medicine proper, and for such <span class="pagenum" id="Page_981">
    981</span>purpose the Indian generally selected a tuft taken from the breast close under the shoulder of the
    animal. When the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache delegates visited Washington in the spring of 1894, they made an
    earnest and successful request for some buffalo hair from the animals in the Zoological Park, together with some
    branches from the cedars in the grounds of the Agricultural Department, to take home with them for use in their
    sacred ceremonies.</p>

  <p>This song refers to the sweat-lodge already described in treating of the Ghost dance among the Sioux. In preparing
    the sweat-lodge a small hole, perhaps a foot deep, is dug out in the center of the floor space, to serve as a
    receptacle for the heated stones over which the water is poured to produce the steam. The earth thus dug out is
    piled in a small hillock a few feet in front of the entrance to the sweat-lodge, which always faces the east. This
    small mound is called <i>thi′äya</i> in the Arapaho language, the same name being also applied to a memorial stone
    heap or to a stone monument. It is always surmounted by a buffalo skull, or in these days by the skull of a steer,
    placed so as to face the doorway of the lodge. The <i>thi′äya</i> is mentioned in several of the Ghost-dance songs,
    and usually, as here, in connection with crying or lamentation, as though the sight of these things in the trance
    vision brings up sad recollections.</p>

  <p>The crow (<i>ho</i>) is the sacred bird of the Ghost dance, being revered as the messenger from the spirit world
    because its color is symbolic of death and the shadow land. The raven, which is practically a larger crow, and which
    lives in the mountains, but occasionally comes down into the plains, is also held sacred and regarded as a bringer
    of omens by the prairie tribes, as well as by the Tlinkit and others of the northwest coast and by the Cherokee in
    the east. The crow is depicted on the shirts, leggings, and moccasins of the Ghost dancers, and its feathers are
    worn on their heads, and whenever it is possible to kill one, the skin is stuffed as in life and carried in the
    dance, as shown in the picture of Black Coyote (<a href="#plate_cv">plate <span class="smcap">cv</span>)</a>. At one time the dancers in
    Left Hand’s camp had a crow which it was claimed had the power of speech and prophetic utterance, and its hoarse
    inarticulate cries were interpreted as inspired messages from the spirit world. Unfortunately the bird did not
    thrive in confinement, and soon took its departure for the land of spirits, leaving the Arapaho once more dependent
    on the guidance of the trance revelations. The eagle, the magpie, and the sage-hen are also sacred in the Ghost
    dance, the first being held in veneration by Indians, as well as by other peoples throughout the world, while the
    magpie and the sage-hen are revered for their connection with the country of the messiah and the mythology of his
    tribe.</p>

  <p>The crow was probably held sacred by all the tribes of the Algonquian race. Roger Williams, speaking of the New
    England tribes, says that although the crows sometimes did damage to the corn, yet hardly one Indian in a hundred
    would kill one, because it was their tradition that this bird had brought them their first grain and vegetables,
    carrying a grain of corn in one ear and a bean in the other, from the field of their great god Cautantouwit in
    Sowwani′u, the southwest, the happy spirit world where dwelt the gods and the souls<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_983">983</span> of the great and good. The souls of the wicked were not permitted to enter this
    elysium after death, but were doomed to wander without rest or home. (<i>Williams, Key into the Language of America,
    1643.</i>)</p>

  <p>In Arapaho belief, the spirit world is in the west, not on the same level with this earth of ours, but higher up,
    and separated also from it by a body of water. In their statement of the Ghost-dance mythology referred to in this
    song, the crow, as the messenger and leader of the spirits who had gone before, collected their armies on the other
    side and advanced at their head to the hither limit of the shadow land. Then, looking over, they saw far below them
    a sea, and far out beyond it toward the east was the boundary of the earth, where lived the friends they were
    marching to rejoin. Taking up a pebble in his beak, the crow then dropped it into the water and it became a mountain
    towering up to the land of the dead. Down its rocky slope he brought his army until they halted at the edge of the
    water. Then, taking some dust in his bill, the crow flew out and dropped it into the water as he flew, and it became
    a solid arm of land stretching from the spirit world to the earth. He returned and flew out again, this time with
    some blades of grass, which he dropped upon the land thus made, and at once it was covered with a green sod. Again
    he returned, and again flew out, this time with some twigs in his bill, and dropping these also upon the new land,
    at once it was covered with a forest of trees. Again he flew back to the base of the mountain, and is now, for the
    fourth time, coming on at the head of all the countless spirit host which has already passed over the sea and is
    marshaling on the western boundary of the earth.</p>

    world, to conduct him to his friends who had gone before. The song is a favorite one, and is sung with a quick
    forcible tune when the excitement begins to grow more intense, in order to hasten the trances, the idea conveyed to
    the dancers being that their spirit friends are close at hand.</p>

  <p>This song was composed by Nakash, or “Sage,” one of the northern Arapaho delegates to the messiah. It evidently
    refers to one of his trance experiences in the other world, and has to do with an interesting feature in the
    sociology of the Arapaho and other prairie tribes. The <i>ga′ahinĕ′na</i> or <i>gaahi′na</i>, “coyote men,” were an
    order of men of middle age who acted as pickets or lookouts for the camp. When the band encamped in some convenient
    situation for hunting or other business, it was the duty of these men, usually four or six in a band, to take their
    stations on the nearest hills to keep watch and give timely warning in case of the approach of an enemy. It was an
    office of danger and responsibility, but was held in corresponding respect. When on duty, the <i>gaahi′nĕn</i> wore
    a white buffalo robe and had his face painted with white clay and carried in his hand the <i>ya′haga′ahi′na</i> or
    “coyote gun,” a club decorated with feathers and other ornaments and usually covered with a sheath of bear gut
    (<i>i′tha′q</i>). He must be unmarried and remain so while in office, finally choosing his own successor and
    delivering to him the “coyote gun” as a staff of authority. They were never all off duty at the same time, but at
    least half were always on guard, one or more coming down at a time to the village to eat or sleep. They built no
    shelter on the hills, but slept there in their buffalo robes, or sometimes came down in turn and slept in their own
    tipis. They usually, however, preferred to sleep alone upon the hills in order to receive inspiration in dreams. If
    attacked or surprised by the enemy, they were expected to fight. The watcher was sometimes called
    <i>higa′ahi′na-ĭt</i>, “the man with the coyote gun.” The corresponding officer among the Cheyenne carried a bow and
    arrows instead of a club.</p>

  <p>In his trance vision the author of this song saw a large camp of Arapaho, and in the midst of the camp circle, as
    in the old days, were sitting the seven priests of the <i>Chĭ′nachichi′bät</i>, each wearing on his head the
    Thunderbird headdress, already described and figured under song number 14. This vision of the old life of the tribe
    brought up sorrowful memories and caused him to weep. In the similar song next given the singer laments for the
    <i>Chĭ′nachichi′bät</i> and the <i>bä′qati</i> gaming wheel. The priests here referred to were seven in number, and
    constituted the highest order of the military and social organization which existed among the Blackfeet, Sioux,
    Cheyenne, Kiowa, and probably all the prairie tribes excepting the Comanche in the south, among whom it seems to
    have been unknown. The society, so far as it has come under the notice of white men, has commonly been designated by
    them as the “Dog Soldier” society—a misapprehension of a name belonging probably to only one of the six or eight
    orders of the organization. The corresponding Blackfoot organization, the <i>Ikunuhkatsi</i> or “All Comrades,” is
    described by Grinnell in his “Blackfoot Lodge Tales.” The Kiowa organization will be noted later.</p>

  <p>Among the Arapaho the organization was called <i>Bĕni′nĕna</i>, “Warriors,” and consisted of eight degrees or
    orders, including nearly all the men of the tribe above the age of about seventeen. Those who were not enrolled in
    some one of the eight orders were held in but little respect, and were not allowed to take part in public
    ceremonies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_987">987</span> or to accompany war expeditions. Each of the first six
    orders had its own peculiar dance, and the members of the principal warrior orders had also their peculiar staff or
    badge of rank.</p>

  <p>First and lowest in rank were the <i>Nuhinĕ′na</i> or Fox men, consisting of young men up to the age of about 25
    years. They had no special duties or privileges, but had a dance called the <i>Nuha′wŭ</i> or fox dance.</p>

  <p>Next came the <i>Hă′thahu′ha</i> or Star men, consisting of young warriors about 30 years of age. Their dance was
    called the <i>Ha′thahŭ</i>.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 94</span>—Dog-soldier insignia—rattle and quirt.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The third order was that of the <i>Hichăä′quthi</i> or Club men. Their dance was called <i>Hichăä′qawŭ</i>. They
    were an important part of the warrior organization, and were all men in the prime of life. The four leaders carried
    wooden clubs, bearing a general resemblance in shape to a gun, notched along the edges and variously ornamented. In
    an attack on the enemy it was the duty of these leaders to dash on ahead and strike the enemy with these clubs, then
    to ride back again and take their places in the front of the charge. It hardly need be<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_988">988</span> said that the position of leader of the <i>Hichăä′quthi</i> was a dangerous honor,
    but the honor was in proportion to the very danger, and there were always candidates for a vacancy. It was one of
    those offices where the holder sometimes died but never resigned. The other members of the order carried sticks
    carved at one end in the rude semblance of a horse head and pointed at the other. In desperate encounters they were
    expected to plant these sticks in the ground in line in front of the body of warriors and to fight beside them to
    the death unless a retreat should be ordered by the chief in command.</p>

  <p>The fourth order was called <i>Bitahi′nĕna</i> or Spear men, and their dance was called <i>Bitaha′wŭ</i>. This
    order came originally from the Cheyenne. Their duties and peculiar insignia of office were about the same among all
    the tribes. They performed police duty in camp, when traveling, and on the hunt, and were expected to see that the
    orders of the chief were obeyed by the tribe. For instance, if any person violated the tribal code or failed to
    attend a general dance or council, a party of <i>Bitahi′nĕna</i> was sent to kill his dogs, destroy his tipi, or in
    extreme cases to shoot his ponies. On hunting expeditions it was their business to keep the party together and see
    that no one killed a buffalo until the proper ceremonies had been performed and the order was given by the chief.
    They were regarded as the representatives of the law and were never resisted in performing their duty or inflicting
    punishments. In war they were desperate warriors, equaling or surpassing even the <i>Hichăä′quthi</i>. Of the
    leaders of the order, two carried a sort of shepherd’s crook called <i>nu′sa-icha′tha</i>, having a lance point at
    its lower end; two others carried lances wrapped around with otter skin; four carried lances painted black; one
    carried a club shaped like a baseball bat, and one carried a rattle made of the scrotum of a buffalo and ornamented
    with its hair. In battle, if the enemy took shelter behind defenses, it was this man’s duty to lead the charge,
    throw his rattle among the enemy, and then follow it himself.</p>

  <p>The fifth order was called <i>Aha′känĕ′na</i> or Crazy men. They were men more than 50 years of age, and were not
    expected to go to war, but must have graduated from all the lower orders. Their duties were religious and
    ceremonial, and their insignia consisted of a bow and a bundle of blunt arrows. Their dance was the <i>Ahaka′wŭ</i>
    or crazy dance, which well deserved the name. It will be described in another place.</p>

  <p>The sixth was the order of the <i>Hĕthĕ′hinĕ′na</i> or Dog men. Their dance was called <i>Hĕthĕwa′wû′</i>. They had
    four principal leaders and two lesser leaders. The four principal leaders were the generals and directors of the
    battle. Each carried a rattle and wore about his neck a buckskin strap (two being yellow, the other two black) which
    hung down to his feet. On approaching the enemy, they were obliged to go forward, shaking their rattles and chanting
    the war song, until some other warriors of the party took the rattles out of their hands. When forming for the
    attack, they dismounted, and, driving their lances into <span class="pagenum" id="Page_989">989</span>the
    ground, tied themselves to them by means of the straps, thus anchoring themselves in front of the battle. Here they
    remained until, if the battle seemed lost, they themselves gave the order to retreat. Even then they waited until
    some of their own society released them by pulling the lances out of the ground and whipping them away from the
    place with a peculiar quirt carried only by the private members of this division. No one was allowed to retreat
    without their permission, on penalty of disgrace, nor were they themselves allowed to retire until thus released.
    Should their followers forget to release them in the confusion of retreat, they were expected to die at their posts.
    They could not be released excepting by one of their own division, and anyone else attempting to pull up the lances
    from the ground was resisted as an enemy. When pursued on the retreat, they must give up their horses to the women,
    if necessary, and either find other horses or turn and face the enemy alone on foot. They seldom accompanied any but
    large war parties, and, although they did but little actual fighting, their very presence inspired the warriors with
    desperate courage, and the driving of their lances into the ground was always understood as the signal for an
    encounter to the death.</p>

  <p>The seventh order was that of the <i>Nûnaha′wŭ</i>, a word of which the meaning is now unknown. This was a secret
    order. They had no dance and their ceremonies were witnessed only by themselves. They did not fight, but accompanied
    the war parties, and every night in secret performed ceremonies and prayers for their success.</p>

  <p>The eighth and highest order was that of the <i>Chĭ′nachinĕ′na</i> or Water-pouring men, the “seven venerable
    priests” to whom the song refers. They were the high priests and instructors of all the other orders, and were seven
    in number, from among the oldest warriors of the tribe. Their name refers to their pouring the water over the heated
    stones in the sweat-house to produce steam. They had no dance, and were not expected to go to war, although one of
    the seven was allowed to accompany the war party, should he so elect. Their ceremonies were performed in a large
    sweat-lodge, called <i>chĭnachichi′bät</i>, which, when the whole tribe was camped together, occupied the center of
    the circle, between the entrance and the lodge in which was kept the sacred medicine pipe. Unlike the ordinary
    sweat-lodge, this one had no mound and buffalo skull in front of the entrance.</p>

  <p>The warrior organization of the Kiowa is called <i>Yä′pähe</i>, “Soldiers,” and consisted of six orders, each with
    its own dance, songs, and ceremonial dress. 1. <i>Poläñyup</i> or <i>Tsäñ′yui</i>, “Rabbits.” These were boys and
    young men from 8 to 15 years of age. Their dance, in which they were drilled by certain old men, has a peculiar
    step, in imitation of the jumping movement of a rabbit; 2. <i>Ädalto′yui</i>, or <i>Te′ñbiyu′i</i>, “Young Mountain
    Sheep,” literally “Herders or Corralers;” 3. <i>Tseñtä′nmo</i>, “Horse Head-dress (?) people;” 4. <i>Toñkoñ′ko</i>,
    (?) “Black-leg people;” 5. <i>T‘äñpe′ko</i>, “Skunkberry (?) people;” 6. <i>Kâ′itseñ′ko</i>, “Principal Dogs or Real
    Dogs.” These last were the highest warrior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_990">990</span> order, and also the
    camp police, combining the functions of the <i>Bitahi′nĕna</i> and the <i>Hĕthĕ′binĕ′na</i> of the Arapaho
    organization. Their two leaders carried an arrow-shape lance, with which they anchored themselves in the front of
    the battle by means of buckskin straps brought over the shoulders. The <i>Toñkoñ′ko</i> captains carried in a
    similar way a crook-shape lance, called <i>pabo′n</i>, similar to that of the <i>Bitahi′nĕna</i> of the Arapaho.</p>

  <p>This song refers to the pemmican or preparation of dried and pounded meat, which formerly formed a favorite food of
    the prairie tribes, and which the author of the song evidently tasted as it was being prepared by the women in the
    spirit world. (See <a href="#Sioux_7">Sioux song 7</a>.) One must be an Indian to know the thrill of joy that would come to the heart of
    the dancers when told that some dreamer had seen their former friends in the spirit world still making and feasting
    on pemmican. During the first year or two of the excitement, it several times occurred at Ghost dances in the north
    and south, among Sioux as well as among Arapaho and others, that meat was exhibited and tasted as genuine buffalo
    beef or pemmican brought back from the spirit world by one of the dancers. It is not necessary to explain how this
    deception was accomplished or made successful. It is sufficient to know that it was done, and that the dancers were
    then in a condition to believe anything.</p>

  <p>This song refers to the vision of a northern Arapaho, who found one of his friends in the spirit world preparing a
    pitfall trap to catch eagles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_992">992</span> Wherever found, the eagle was
    regarded as sacred among the Indian tribes both east and west, and its feathers were highly prized for ornamental
    and “medicine” purposes, and an elaborately detailed ritual of prayer and ceremony was the necessary accompaniment
    to its capture. Among all the tribes the chief purpose of this ritual was to obtain the help of the gods in inducing
    the eagle to approach the hunter, and to turn aside the anger of the eagle spirits at the necessary sacrilege. The
    feathers most valued were those of the tail and wings. These were used to ornament lances and shields, to wear upon
    the head, and to decorate the magnificent war bonnets, the finest of which have a pendant or trail of eagle-tail
    feathers reaching from the warrior’s head to the ground when he stands erect. The whistle used in the sun dance and
    other great ceremonies is made of a bone from the leg or wing of the eagle, and the fans carried by the warriors on
    parade and used also to sprinkle the holy water in the mescal ceremony of the southern prairie tribes is commonly
    made of the entire tail or wing of that bird. Hawk feathers are sometimes used for these various purposes, but are
    always considered far inferior to those of the eagle. The smaller feathers are used upon arrows. Eagle feathers and
    ponies were formerly the standard of value and the medium of exchange among the prairie tribes, as wampum was with
    those of the Atlantic coast. The standard varied according to place and season, but in a general way from two to
    four eagles were rated as equal to a horse. In these days the eagle-feather war bonnets and eagle-tail fans are the
    most valuable parts of an Indian’s outfit and the most difficult to purchase from him. Among the pueblo tribes
    eagles are sometimes taken from the nest when young and kept in cages and regularly stripped of their best feathers.
    Among the Caddo, Cherokee, and other tribes of the timbered country in the east they were shot with bow and arrow or
    with the gun, but always according to certain ritual ceremonies. Among the prairie tribes along the whole extent of
    the plains they were never shot, but must be captured alive in pitfalls and then strangled or crushed to death, if
    possible without the shedding of blood. A description of the Arapaho method will answer with slight modifications
    for all the prairie tribes.</p>

  <p>The hunter withdrew with his family away from the main camp to some rough hilly country where the eagles were
    abundant. After some preliminary prayers he went alone to the top of the highest hill and there dug a pit large
    enough to sit or lie down in, being careful to carry the earth taken out of the hole so far away from the place that
    it would not attract the notice of the eagle. The pit was roofed over with a covering of light willow twigs, above
    which were placed earth and grass to give it a natural appearance. The bait was a piece of fresh meat, or, as
    appears from this song, a piece of tallow stripped from the ribs of the buffalo. This was tied to a rawhide string
    and laid upon the top of the pit, while the rope was passed down through the roof into the cavity below. A coyote
    skin, stuffed and set up erect as in life, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_993">993</span> sometimes placed
    near the bait to add to the realistic effect. Having sat up all night, singing the eagle songs and purifying himself
    for the ceremony, the hunter started before daylight, without eating any breakfast or drinking water, and went up
    the hill to the pit, which he entered, and, having again closed the opening, he seated himself inside holding the
    end of the string in his hands, to prevent a coyote or other animal from taking the bait, and waiting for the eagles
    to come.</p>

  <p>Should other birds come, he drove them away or paid no attention to them. When at last the eagle came the other
    birds at once flew away. The eagle swooped down, alighting always at one side and then walking over upon the roof of
    the trap to get at the bait, when the hunter, putting up his hand through the framework, seized the eagle by the
    legs, pulled it down and quickly strangled it or broke its neck. He then rearranged the bait and the roof and sat
    down to wait for another eagle. He might be so lucky as to capture several during the day, or so unfortunate as to
    take none at all. At night, but not before, he repaired to his own tipi to eat, drink, and sleep, and was at the pit
    again before daylight. While in the pit he did not eat, drink, or sleep. The eagle hunt, if it may be so called,
    lasted four days, and must end then, whatever might have been the good or bad fortune of the hunter.</p>

  <p>At the expiration of four days he returned to his home with the dead bodies of the eagles thus caught. A small
    lodge was set up outside his tipi and in this the eagles were hung up by the neck upon a pole laid across two forked
    sticks driven into the ground. After some further prayers and purifications the feathers were stripped from the
    bodies as they hung.</p>

  <p>The Blackfoot method, as described by Grinnell, in his Blackfoot Lodge Tales, was the same in all essentials as
    that of the Arapaho. He adds several details, which were probably common to both tribes and to others, but which my
    Arapaho informants failed to mention. While the hunter was away in the pit his wife or daughters at home must not
    use an awl for sewing or for other purposes, as, should they do so, the eagle might scratch the hunter. He took a
    human skull with him into the pit, in order that he might be as invisible to the eagle as the spirit of the former
    owner of the skull. He must not eat the berries of the wild rose during this period, or the eagle would not attack
    the bait, and he must put a morsel of pemmican into the mouth of the dead eagle in order to gain the good will of
    its fellows and induce them to come in and be caught.</p>

  <p>The eagle-catching ceremony of the Caddo, Cherokee, and other eastern tribes will be noticed in treating of the
    Caddo songs.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This song is from the northern Arapaho. The author of it, in his visit to the spirit world, found his former
    friends playing the old game of the <i>bä′qati</i> wheel, which was practically obsolete among the prairie tribes,
    but which is being revived since the advent of the Ghost dance. As it was a favorite game with the men in the olden
    times, a great many of the songs founded on these trance visions refer to it, and the wheel and sticks are made by
    the dreamer and carried in the dance as they sing.</p>

  <p>The game is played with a wheel (<i>bä′qati</i>, “large wheel”) and two pairs of throwing sticks
    (<i>qa′qa-u′nûtha</i>). The Cheyenne call the wheel <i>ä′ko′yo</i> or <i>äkwi′u</i>, and the sticks
    <i>hoo′isi′yonots</i>. It is a man’s game, and there are three players, one rolling the wheel, while the other two,
    each armed with a pair of throwing sticks, run after it and throw the sticks so as to cross the wheel in a certain
    position. The two throwers are the contestants, the one who rolls the wheel being merely an assistant. Like most
    Indian games, it is a means of gambling, and high stakes are sometimes wagered on the result. It is common to the
    Arapaho, Cheyenne, Sioux, and probably to all the northern prairie tribes, but is not found among the Kiowa or
    Comanche in the south.</p>

  <p>The wheel is about 18 inches in diameter, and consists of a flexible young tree branch, stripped of its bark and
    painted, with the two ends fastened together with sinew or buckskin string. At equal distances around the
    circumference of the wheel are cut four figures, the two opposite each other constituting a pair, but being
    distinguished by different colors, usually blue or black and red, and by lines or notches on the face. These figures
    are designated simply by their colors. Figures of birds, crescents, etc., are sometimes also cut or painted upon the
    wheel, but have nothing to do with the game. (See <a href="#plate_cxi">plate <span class="smcap">cxi</span></a>.)</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_995">995</span></p>

  <p>The sticks are light rods, about 30 inches long, tied in pairs by a peculiar arrangement of buckskin strings, and
    distinguished from one another by pieces of cloth of different colors fastened to the strings. There is also a pile
    of tally sticks, usually a hundred in number, about the size of lead pencils and painted green, for keeping count of
    the game. The sticks are held near the center in a peculiar manner between the fingers of the closed hand. When the
    wheel is rolled, each player runs from the same side, and endeavors to throw the sticks so as to strike the wheel in
    such a way that when it falls both sticks of his pair shall be either over or under a certain figure. It requires
    dexterity to do this, as the string has a tendency to strike the wheel in such a way as to make one stick fall under
    and the other over, in which case the throw counts for nothing. The players assign their own value to each figure,
    the usual value being five points for one and ten for the other figure, with double that number for a throw which
    crosses the two corresponding figures, and one hundred tallies to the game.</p>

  <p>The wheel-and-stick game, in some form or another, was almost universal among our Indian tribes. Another game among
    the prairie tribes is played with a netted wheel and a single stick or arrow, the effort being to send the arrow
    through the netting as nearly as possible to the center or bull’s-eye. This game is called <i>ana′wati′n-hati</i>,
    “playing wheel,” by the Arapaho.</p>

    rehearsal, and was therefore always held in reserve until the singers were about ready to separate. The tune is one
    of the best.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_997">997</span> The special office of the crow as the messenger from

  <p>The meaning of this song is somewhat obscure. It seems to be a message from the messiah to the effect that he
    paints himself with yellow paint, because it pleases him, the inference being that it would please him to have his
    children do the same. Those who take part in the sun dance are usually painted yellow, that being the color of the
    sun. This song is peculiar in having at the end two sharp yelps, in the style of the ordinary songs of the warrior
    dances.</p>

  <p>This song was composed by Little Raven, one of the delegation of seven from the southern Arapaho and Cheyenne which
    visited the messiah in Nevada in August, 1891. It is a message to the believers to be ready for the near coming of
    the new earth. The first line is sometimes sung <i>I′nita′ta-u′sä-hu′na</i>.</p>

  <p>This song affords a good specimen of the possibilities of Indian word building. The second word might serve as a
    companion piece to Mark Twain’s picture of a complete word in German. It consists of seventeen syllables, all so
    interwoven to complete the sense of the word sentence that no part can be separated from the rest without destroying
    the whole. The verbal part proper indicates that “I have given you (plural) a headdress again.” The final syllables,
    <i>wa-u′i-naga′thi</i>, show that the headdress consists of the tail feathers (<i>wagathi</i>) of the magpie
    (<i>wa-u-i</i>). The syllable <i>cha</i> implies repetition or return of action, this being probably not the first
    time that the messiah had given magpie feathers to his visitors.</p>

  <p>The magpie (<i>Pica hudsonica</i> or <i>mittalii</i>) of the Rocky mountains and Sierra Nevada and the intermediate
    region of Nevada and Utah is perhaps the most conspicuous bird in the Paiute country. It bears a general resemblance
    to a crow or blackbird, being about the size<span class="pagenum" id="Page_999">999</span> of the latter, and
    jet black, with the exception of the breast, which is white, and a white spot on each wing. In its tail are two long
    feathers with beautiful changeable metallic luster. It is a home bird, frequenting the neighborhood of the Paiute
    camps in small flocks. It is held sacred among the Paiute, by whom the long tail feathers are as highly prized for
    decorative purposes as eagle feathers are among the tribes of the plains. The standard price for such feathers in
    1891 was 25 cents a pair. The delegates who crossed the mountains to visit the messiah brought back with them
    quantities of these feathers, which thenceforth filled an important place in the ceremonial of the Ghost dance. In
    fact they were so eagerly sought after that the traders undertook to meet the demand, at first by importing genuine
    magpie feathers from the mountains, but later by fraudulently substituting selected crow feathers from the east at
    the same price.</p>

  <p>The song is also peculiar in referring to the messiah as “my mother” (<i>nena</i>) instead of “our father”
    (<i>hesûnanin</i>), as usual.</p>

  <p>The woman who composed this song tells how, on waking up in the spirit world, she met there a party of her former
    girl companions and sat down with them to play the two games universally popular with the women of all the prairie
    tribes.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 95</span>—Diagram of awl game.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The first is called <i>nĕ′bäku′thana</i> by the Arapaho and <i>tsoñä</i> or “awl game” (from <i>tsoñ</i>, an awl)
    by the Kiowa, on account of an awl, the Indian woman’s substitute for a needle, being used to keep record of the
    score. The game is becoming obsolete in the north, but is the everyday summer amusement of the women among the
    Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache in the southern plains. It is very amusing on account of the unforeseen “rivers” and
    “whips” that are constantly turning up to disappoint the expectant winner, and a party of women will frequently sit
    around the blanket for half a day at a time, with a constant ripple of laughter and good-humored jokes as they
    follow the chances of the play. It would make a very pretty picnic game, or could readily be adapted to the parlor
    of civilization.</p>

  <figure class="illowp50 figright" id="fig_96">
    <img src="images/fig96.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 96</span>—Sticks used in awl game.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The players sit upon the ground around a blanket marked in charcoal with lines and dots, and quadrants in the
    corners, as shown in <a href="#fig_95">figure 95</a>. In the center is a stone upon which the sticks are thrown. Each dot, excepting those
    between the parallels, counts a point, making twenty-four points for dots. Each of the parallel lines, and each end
    of the curved lines in the corners, also counts a point,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1003">1003</span> making
    sixteen points for the lines or forty points in all. The players start from the bottom, opposing players moving in
    opposite directions, and with each throw of the sticks the thrower moves her awl forward and sticks it into the
    blanket at the dot or line to which her throw carries her. The parallels on each of the four sides are called
    “rivers,” and the dots within these parallels do not count in the game. The rivers at the top and bottom are
    “dangerous” and can not be crossed, and when the player is so unlucky as to score a throw which brings her upon the
    edge of the river (i.&nbsp;e., upon the first line of either of these pairs of parallels), she “falls into the river” and
    must lose all she has hitherto gained, and begin again at the start. In the same way, when a player moving around in
    one direction makes a throw which brings her awl to the place occupied by the awl of her opponent coming around from
    the other side, the said opponent is “whipped back” to the starting point and must begin all over again. Thus there
    is a constant succession of unforeseen accidents which furnish endless amusement to the players.</p>

    <img src="images/fig97.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 97</span>—Trump sticks used in awl game.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The game is played with four sticks, each from 6 to 10 inches long, flat on one side and round on the other (<a href="#fig_96">figure
    96</a>). One of these is the trump stick and is marked in a distinctive manner in the center on both sides, and is also
    distinguished by having a green line along the flat side (<a href="#fig_97">figure 97</a>), while the others have each a red line. The
    Kiowa call this trump stick <i>sahe</i>, “green,” on account of the green stripe, while the others are called
    <i>guadal</i>, “red.” There are also a number of small green sticks, about the size of lead pencils, for keeping
    tally. Each player in turn takes up the four sticks together in her hand and throws them down on end upon the stone
    in the center. The number of points depends on the number of flat or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1004">
    1004</span> round sides which turn up. A lucky throw with the green or trump stick generally gives the thrower
    another trial in addition. The formula is:</p>

  <table class="small clear">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="min-width: 20em;">One flat side up counts</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>One flat side (if <i>sahe</i>) counts</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 1 and another throw.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Two flat sides up, with or without <i>sahe</i>, count</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Three flat sides up count</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Three flat sides up, including <i>sahe</i>, count</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 3 and another throw.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>All four flat sides up count</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 6 and another throw.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>All four round sides up count</td>
        <td>10 and another throw.</td>
      </tr>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 98</span>—Baskets used in dice game.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Only the flat sides count except when all the sticks turn round side up. This is the best throw of all, as it
    counts ten points and another throw. On completing one round of forty points the player takes one of the small green
    tally sticks from the pile and she who first gets the number of tally sticks previously agreed on wins the game.
    Two, four, or any even number of persons may play the game, half on each side. When two or more play on a side, all
    the partners move up the same number of points at each throw, but only the lucky thrower gets a second trial in case
    of a trump throw.</p>

  <p>The other woman’s game mentioned, the dice game, is called <i>ta-u′sĕta′tina</i> (literally, “striking,” or
    “throwing against” something) by the Arapaho, and <i>mo′nshimûnh</i> by the Cheyenne, the same name being now given
    to the modern card games. It was practically universal among all the tribes east and west, and under the name of
    “hub-bub” is described by a New England writer as far back as 1634, almost precisely as it exists today among the
    prairie tribes. The only difference seems to have been that in the east it was played also by the men, and to the
    accompaniment of a song such as is used in the hand games of the western tribes.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1005">1005</span></p>

  <figure class="illowp40 figright clear" id="fig_99">
    <img src="images/fig99.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 99</span>—Dice used in dice game.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The requisites are a small wicker bowl or basket (<i>hatĕchi′na</i>), five dice made of bone or of plum stones, and
    a pile of tally sticks such as are used in the awl game. The bowl is 6 or 8 inches in diameter and about 2 inches
    deep, and is woven in basket fashion of the tough fibers of the yucca (<a href="#fig_98">figure 98</a>). The dice may be round,
    elliptical, or diamond-shape and are variously marked on one side with lines and figures, the turtle being a
    favorite design among the Arapaho (<a href="#fig_99">figure 99</a>). Two of the five must be alike in shape and marking. The other three
    are marked with another design and may also be of another shape. Any number of women or girls may play, each
    throwing in turn, and sometimes one set of partners playing against another. The players toss up the dice from the
    basket, letting them drop again into it, and score points according to the way the dice turn up in the basket. The
    first throw by each player is made from the hand instead of from the basket. One hundred points usually count a
    game, and stakes are wagered on the result as in almost every other Indian contest of skill or chance. For the
    purpose of explanation, we shall designate two of the five as “rounds” and the other three as “diamonds,” it being
    understood that only the marked side counts in the game, excepting when the throw happens to turn up the three
    diamonds blank while the other two show the marked side, or, as sometimes happens, when all five dice turn up blank.
    In every case all of one kind at least must turn up to score a point. A successful throw entitles the player to
    another throw, while a failure obliges her to pass the basket to some one else. The formula is:</p>

  <table class="small clear">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="min-width: 22em;">1 only of either kind</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2 rounds</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3 diamonds (both rounds with blank side up)</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3 diamonds blank (both rounds with marked side up)</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4 marked sides up</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5 (all) blank sides up</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5 (all) marked sides up</td>
        <td>&nbsp; 8</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>A game similar in principle, but played with six dice instead of five, is also played by the Arapaho women, as well
    as by those of the Comanche and probably also of other tribes.</p>

  <p>The man who made this song when he entered the spirit world in his vision met there one of his boy friends who had
    died long years before, and once more spun tops with him as in childhood.</p>

  <p>Tops are used by all Indian boys, and are made of wood or bone. They are not thrown or spun with a string, but are
    kept in motion by whipping with a small quirt or whip of buckskin. In winter they are spun upon the ice. The younger
    children make tops to twirl with the fingers by running a stick through a small seed berry.</p>

  <p>With the Arapaho, as with many other tribes, the moon is masculine, and the sun is feminine. In mythology the two
    are brother and sister. There are various myths to account for the spots on the moon’s surface, some discerning in
    them a large frog, while to others they bear a likeness to a kettle hung over the fire. The Arapaho name for the
    moon, <i>bi′gushish</i>, means literally “night sun,” the sun itself being called <i>hishinishish</i>, “day sun.” A
    similar nomenclature exists among most other tribes.</p>

  <p>This beautiful song originated among the northern Arapaho, and is a favorite north and south. In it the messiah is
    supposed to be addressing his children. There is a rhythmic swing to the vocalic syllables that makes the tune
    particularly pleasing, and the imagery of thought expressed is poetry itself. The same idea occurs in European
    ballad and legend, and has a parallel in the angel of the evangelist, “clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow upon his
    head.”</p>

  <p>This song was composed by a woman of the southern Arapaho. The reference is not entirely clear, but it is probable
    that in her trance vision she saw her children in the other world playing the game mentioned, and that afterward she
    made the game sticks and carried them in the dance, hoping by this means to obtain another vision of the spirit
    world, where she could again talk with her children who had gone before her to the shadow land. In one Ghost dance
    seven different women carried these game sticks.</p>

  <p>The <i>băti′qtûba</i> (abbreviated <i>ti′qtûp</i>) game of the Arapaho and other prairie tribes somewhat resembles
    the Iroquois game of the “snow snake,” and is played by children or grown persons of both sexes. It<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_1008">1008</span> is a very simple game, the contestants merely throwing or sliding
    the sticks along the ground to see who can send them farthest. Two persons or two parties play against each other,
    boys sometimes playing against girls or men against women. It is, however, more especially a girl’s game. The game
    sticks (<i>bătĭqta′wa</i>) are slender willow rods about 4 feet long, peeled and painted and tipped with a point of
    buffalo horn to enable them to slide more easily along the ground. In throwing, the player holds the stick at the
    upper end with the thumb and fingers, and, swinging it like a pendulum, throws it out with a sweeping motion. Young
    men throw arrows about in the same way, and small boys sometimes throw ordinary reeds or weed stalks. Among the
    Omaha, according to Dorsey, bows, unstrung, are made to slide along the ground or ice in the same manner.</p>

  <p>In his trance vision the author of this song entered a tipi and found it filled with a circle of his old friends
    playing the <i>ga′qutit</i>, or “hunt the button” game. This is a favorite winter game with the prairie tribes, and
    was probably more or less general throughout the country. It is played both by men and women, but never by the two
    sexes together. It is the regular game in the long winter nights after the scattered families have abandoned their
    exposed summer positions on the open prairie, and moved down near one another in the shelter of the timber along the
    streams. When hundreds of Indians are thus camped together, the sound of the drum, the rattle, and the gaming song
    resound nightly through the air. To the stranger there is a fascination about such a camp at night, with the conical
    tipis scattered about under the trees, the firelight from within shining through the white canvas and distinctly
    outlining upon the cloth the figures of the occupants making merry inside with jest and story, while from half a
    dozen different directions comes the measured tap of the Indian drum or the weird chorus of the gaming songs.
    Frequently there will be a party of twenty to thirty men gaming in one tipi, and singing so that their voices can be
    heard far out from the camp, while from another tipi a few rods away comes a shrill chorus from a group of women
    engaged in another game of the same kind.</p>

  <p>The players sit in a circle around the tipi fire, those on one side of the fire playing against those on the other.
    The only requisites are the “button” or <i>ga′qaä</i>, usually a small bit of wood, around which is tied a piece of
    string or otter skin, with a pile of tally sticks, as has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1009">1009</span> been
    already described. Each party has a “button,” that of one side being painted black, the other being red. The leader
    of one party takes the button and endeavors to move it from one hand to the other, or to pass it on to a partner,
    while those of the opposing side keep a sharp lookout, and try to guess in which hand it is. Those having the button
    try to deceive their opponents as to its whereabouts by putting one hand over the other, by folding their arms, and
    by putting their hands behind them, so as to pass the <i>ga′qaä</i>, on to a partner, all the while keeping time to
    the rhythm of a gaming chorus sung by the whole party at the top of their voices. The song is very peculiar, and
    well-nigh indescribable. It is usually, but not always or entirely, unmeaning, and jumps, halts, and staggers in a
    most surprising fashion, but always in perfect time with the movements of the hands and arms of the singers. The
    greatest of good-natured excitement prevails, and every few minutes some more excitable player claps his hands over
    his mouth or beats the ground with his flat palms, and gives out a regular war-whoop. All this time the opposing
    players are watching the hands of the other, or looking straight into their faces to observe every telltale movement
    of their features, and when one thinks he has discovered in which hand the button is, he throws out his thumb toward
    that hand with a loud “<i>that!</i>” Should he guess aright, his side scores a certain number of tallies, and in
    turn takes the button and begins another song. Should the guess be wrong, the losing side must give up an equivalent
    number of tally sticks. So the play goes on until the small hours of the night. It is always a gambling game, and
    the stakes are sometimes very large.</p>

  <p>The first line of the song here given is an imitation of one of these gambling songs. Among the prairie tribes each
    song has one or perhaps two words with meaning bearing on the game, the rest of the song being a succession of
    unmeaning syllables. Among some other tribes, particularly among the Navaho, as described by Dr Washington Matthews,
    the songs have meaning, being prayers to different animal or elemental gods to assist the player.</p>

  <p>As specimens of another variety of gambling songs, we give here two heard among the Paiute of Nevada when visiting
    the messiah in the winter of 1891–92. They have pretty tunes, very distinct from those of the prairie tribes, and
    were borrowed by the Paiute from the Mohave, in whose language they may have a meaning, although unintelligible to
    the Paiute.</p>

  <p>This song is sung about daylight, just before the closing song, after the dancers have danced all night and are now
    ready to quit and go home. When the new doctrine came among the prairie tribes, the Ghost dance was held at
    irregular and frequent intervals, almost every other night, in fact—lasting sometimes until about midnight,
    sometimes until daylight, without any rule. As the ceremonial became crystallized, however, the messiah gave
    instructions that the dance should be held only at intervals of six weeks, and should then continue four consecutive
    nights, lasting the first three nights until about midnight, but on the fourth night to continue all night until
    daylight of the next morning. The original letter containing these directions is given in chapter X. For a long time
    these directions were implicitly followed, but the tendency now is to the original fashion of one-night dances, at
    short intervals. This song to the morning star was sung just before daylight on the final morning of the dance.</p>

  <p>With all the prairie tribes the morning star is held in great reverence and is the subject of much mythological
    belief and ceremony. It is universally represented in their pictographs as a cross, usually of the Maltese pattern.
    In this form it is frequently pictured on the ghost shirts. The Arapaho name, <i>nagaq′</i>, means literally “a
    cross.” The Kiowa know it as <i>t’aiñso</i>, “the cross,” or sometimes, as <i>dä-e′dal</i>, “the great star.”</p>

  <p>This is the closing song of the dance since the return of the great delegation of southern Arapaho and Cheyenne who
    visited the messiah in August, 1891. Before that time the closing song had been number 52, beginning
    <i>Ni′nini′tubi′na hu′hu′</i>. The literal rendering of the second part is “stop five times,” the meaning and
    practice being that they must make five circuits singing this song and then stop. As already stated, in accordance
    with the instructions of the messiah, the Ghost dance is now held (theoretically) at intervals of six weeks and
    continues for four consecutive nights, closing about midnight, excepting on the last night, when the believers dance
    until daylight. As daylight begins to appear in the east, they sing the song to the morning star, as just given
    (number 72), and then, after a short rest, the leaders start this, the closing song, which is sung while the dancers
    make five circuits, resting a few moments between circuits. Then they unclasp hands, wave their blankets in the air
    to fan away all evil influences, and go down to the river to bathe, the men in one place and the women in another.
    After bathing, they resume their clothing and disperse to their various camps, and the Ghost dance is over.</p>

  <h4 id="Arapaho_glossary">ARAPAHO GLOSSARY</h4>

  <p>In this and the other glossaries here given it is intended only to give a concise definition of the meaning of each
    word without going into details of grammar or etymology. The Ghost dance was studied for its mythology, psychology,
    ritual, and history, and language in this connection was only the means to an end, as it was impossible in a few
    months of time to devote close attention to the numerous languages spoken by the tribes represented in the dance.</p>

  <p>The Arapaho language, as will be seen from the specimens given, is eminently vocalic, almost every syllable ending
    in a vowel, and there being almost no double consonant sounds. Like the Cheyenne language, it lacks <i>l</i> and
    <i>r</i>. The most prominent vowel sounds are <i>a</i>, <i>ä</i>, and <i>i</i>, and in some instances there are
    combinations of several vowel sounds without any intervening consonant. The soft <i>th</i> sound is also prominent.
    The <i>g</i> and <i>d</i> frequently approximate to <i>k</i> and <i>t</i>, respectively, and <i>b</i> in the
    standard dialect becomes <i>v</i> among the northern Arapaho. The only sound of the language (excepting the medial
    <i>k</i> and <i>t</i>) not found in English is the gutteral <i>q</i>, and the language is entirely devoid of the
    hissing effect of Cheyenne or the choking sounds of Kiowa.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1013">1013</span></p>

  <p>In the songs it is common to prefix <i>a</i>, and to add <i>i</i>, <i>hi</i>, <i>hu</i>, <i>huhu</i>, etc, to the
    ends of words in order to fill out the meter. In a few cases changes are made in the body of the word for the same
    purpose. In the glossary these unmeaning syllables are not given where they occur at the end of words. Words
    beginning with a vowel sound may sometimes be written as beginning with the breathing <i>h</i>, and <i>s</i> is
    sometimes pronounced <i>sh</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1024">1024</span></p>

  <h4 id="Cheyenne_sign">TRIBAL SIGN</h4>

  <p>The Cheyenne tribal sign, made by drawing the right index finger several times across the left forefinger, is
    commonly interpreted “cut fingers” or “cut wrists,” and is said to be derived from their custom of cutting off the
    fingers and hands of slain enemies. Although the same practice was found among other tribes, the Cheyenne were
    particularly distinguished in this regard. In Mackenzie’s great fight with the Cheyenne in Wyoming, in 1876, two
    necklaces made of human fingers were found in the captured Indian camp, together with a small bag filled with hands
    cut from the bodies of children of the Shoshoni tribe, their enemies. One of these necklaces was afterward deposited
    in the National Museum at Washington. (See <i><a href="#Bourke">Bourke</a></i> in <i>Ninth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology</i>.)
    Some competent Indian authorities say, however, that the sign is intended to indicate “stripe people,” or
    “striped-arrow people,” referring to the fact that the Cheyenne usually feathered their arrows with the striped
    feathers of the wild turkey. This agrees with the interpretation of the name for the Cheyenne in several different
    languages.</p>

  <h4 id="Cheyenne_sketch">SKETCH OF THE TRIBE</h4>

  <p>The Cheyenne are one of the westernmost tribes of the great Algonquian stock. In one of their ghost songs they sing
    of the “turtle river,” on which they say they once lived. (<i>Cheyenne song 3.</i>) From several evidences this
    seems to be identical with the Saint Croix, which forms the boundary between Wisconsin and Minnesota. This statement
    agrees with the opinion of <a href="#Clark">Clark</a> (<i>Indian Sign Language</i>), who locates their earliest tradition in the
    neighborhood of Saint Anthony falls. They were driven out by the Sioux and forced toward the northwest, where they
    came in contact with the Asiniboin (called by them Hohe′), with whom they were never afterward at peace. At a later
    period, according to Lewis and Clark, they lived on the Cheyenne branch of Red river, in northern Minnesota, whence
    they were again driven by the Sioux into the prairie.</p>

  <p>In 1805 they wandered about the head of Cheyenne river of Dakota and in the Black hills, and were at war with the
    Sioux, though at peace with most other tribes. Since then they have pushed on to the west and south, always in close
    confederation with the Arapaho. These two tribes say they have never known a time when they were not associated.
    About forty years ago, in Wyoming, the band since known as the northern Cheyenne separated from the others (Clark),
    and have since lived chiefly in Montana or with the Sioux, with whom the Cheyenne made peace about sixty years ago.
    The other and larger portion of the tribe continued to range chiefly on the lands of the Arkansas and Canadian in
    Colorado and the western part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1025">1025</span> Kansas and Oklahoma. They and
    the Arapaho made peace with the Kiowa and Comanche in 1840, and raided in connection with these tribes into Texas
    and Mexico until assigned in 1869 to a reservation in what is now western Oklahoma. In 1874 they, as well as the
    Kiowa, Comanche, and Kiowa Apache, again went on the warpath in consequence of the depredations of the buffalo
    hunters, but the outbreak was speedily suppressed. In 1890 they sold their reservation and took allotments in
    severalty. The northern Cheyenne joined the Sioux in the “Custer war” of 1876–77. At the surrender of the hostiles
    they were removed to Oklahoma and placed with the southern Cheyenne, but were much dissatisfied with their location,
    the dissatisfaction culminating in the attempt of a large party, under Dull Knife, to escape to the north, in
    September, 1878. They were pursued, and a part of them captured and confined at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, whence they
    made a desperate attempt to escape on the night of January 9, 1879, resulting in the killing of nearly all of the
    prisoners. They were finally assigned a reservation in Montana, where they now are, with the exception of a few
    among the Sioux. According to the official report for 1892, the southern Cheyenne in Oklahoma numbered 2,119, the
    northern Cheyenne in Montana, 1,200, and those with the Sioux at Pine Edge, South Dakota, 120, a total of 3,439.</p>

  <p>The Cheyenne have eleven tribal divisions. They have at least two dialects, but probably more. The tribal divisions
    in their order in the camping circle are—</p>

  <p>1. <i>Evĭ′sts-unĭ′pahĭs</i> (“smoky lodges”—Grinnell, <i>fide</i> Clark).</p>

  <p>2. <i>Sŭta′ya</i> or <i>Sŭ′tasi′na</i>. This is one of the most important divisions and formerly constituted a
    distinct tribe, but was afterward incorporated with the Cheyenne. According to concurrent Cheyenne and Blackfoot
    tradition, as given by Grinnell, they seem originally to have been a part of the Blackfeet, who became separated
    from the main body of their tribe by the sudden breaking up of the ice while crossing a large river. They drifted to
    the southward and finally met and joined the Cheyenne in the Black hills. Their name, spelled <i>Suti</i> by
    Grinnell, is said to mean “strange talkers.” They live now on the upper Washita in Oklahoma and speak a dialect
    differing considerably from that of the rest of the tribe.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Ĭ′sium-itä′niuw’</i>, (“ridge-people;” singular, <i>Ĭ′siumi-tän</i>—Grinnell, <i>fide</i> Clark).</p>

  <p>4. <i>Hĕwă-tä′niuw’</i>, “hairy men.” The name is also sometimes used collectively to designate all of the southern
    Cheyenne as distinguished from the northern Cheyenne, called collectively <i>Hmĭ′sĭs</i>. The southern Cheyenne are
    also designated collectively as <i>So′wăniă</i>, “southerners.”</p>

  <p>5. <i>Ŏ′ivimă′na</i>, “scabby.” This name is said to have been given them originally on account of an epidemic
    which once broke out among their horses and rendered them mangy.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Wi′tapi′u</i> (“haters”—Grinnell, <i>ƒide</i> Clark).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1026">1026</span></p>

  <p>7. <i>Hotă′mi-tä′niuw′</i>, “dog men,” or <i>Mĭ′stäviĭ′nût</i>, “heavy eyebrows.” This is also the name of one of
    the divisions of their warrior organization.</p>

  <p>8. <i>O′tu′gŭnŭ.</i></p>

  <p>9. <i>Hmĭ′sĭs</i>, “eaters.” This is the most important division of the northern Cheyenne, and the name is also
    used by those of the south to designate all the northern Cheyenne collectively.</p>

  <p>10. <i>Anskowĭ′nĭs.</i></p>

  <p>11. <i>Pĭnû′tgû′.</i></p>

  <figure class="illowp100" id="fig_100">
    <img src="images/fig100.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 100</span>—Cheyenne camping circle.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>These are the names given to the author by the Cheyenne themselves as the complete list of their tribal divisions.
    Grinnell, on the authority of the Clark manuscript, names six of these with two others, <i>Matsĭ′shkota</i>, “corpse
    from a scaffold,” and <i>Miayŭma</i>, “red lodges,” which may be identical with some of the others named above, or
    may perhaps be degrees of their military organization instead of tribal divisions.</p>

  <p>In the great ceremony of the “medicine arrow,” last enacted on the Washita in 1890, the camping circle opened to
    the south. At all other gatherings of the tribe the circle opened to the east, agreeable to the<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_1027">1027</span> general Indian custom, the several divisions encamping in the order shown in
    <a href="#fig_100">figure 100</a>.</p>

  <p>The Cheyenne, like the prairie tribes generally, are, or were until within a few years past, a nation of nomads,
    living in skin tipis, and depending almost entirely on the buffalo for food. Yet they have a dim memory of a time
    when they lived in permanent villages and planted corn, and in their genesis tradition, which occupies four “smokes”
    or nights in the telling, they relate how they “lost” the corn a long time ago before they became wanderers on the
    plains. They deposit their dead on scaffolds in trees, unlike their confederates, the Arapaho, who bury in the
    ground. Their most sacred possession is the bundle of “medicine arrows,” now in possession of the southern division
    of the tribe. They have a military organization similar to that existing among the Arapaho and other prairie tribes,
    as described under number 43 of the Arapaho songs. Above all the tribes of the plains they are distinguished for
    their desperate courage and pride of bearing, and are preeminently warriors among people whose trade is war. They
    are strongly conservative and have steadily resisted every advance of civilization, here again differing from the
    Arapaho, who have always shown a disposition to meet the white man half-way. In fact, no two peoples could well
    exhibit more marked differences of characteristics on almost every point than these two confederated tribes. The
    Cheyenne have quick and strong intelligence, but their fighting temper sometimes renders them rather unmanageable
    subjects with whom to deal. Their conservatism and tribal pride tend to restrain them from following after strange
    gods, so that in regard to the new messiah they assume a rather skeptical position, while they conform to all the
    requirements of the dance code in order to be on the safe side.</p>

  <p><a href="#Clark">Clark</a>, in his <i>Indian Sign Language</i>, thus sums up the characteristics of the Cheyenne:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>As a tribe they have been broken and scattered, but in their wild and savage way they fought well for their
      country, and their history during the past few years has been written in blood. The men of the Cheyenne Indians
      rank as high in the scale of honesty, energy, and tenacity of purpose as those of any other tribe I have ever met,
      and in physique and intellect they are superior to those of most tribes and the equal of any. Under the most
      demoralizing and trying circumstances they have preserved in a remarkable degree that part of their moral code
      which relates to chastity, and public sentiment has been so strong in them in regard to this matter that they have
      been, and are still, noted among all the tribes which surround them, for the virtue of their women.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Cheyenne language lacks the liquids <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>. It is full of hissing sounds and difficult
    combinations of consonants, so that it does not lend itself readily to song composition, for which reason, among
    others, the Cheyenne in the south usually join the Arapaho in the Ghost dance and sing the Arapaho songs.</p>

  <p>The interpretation of this song is imperfect and the meaning is not clear. It evidently refers to the earthquake
    which it is supposed will occur at the moment of contact of the spirit world with the old earth. The literal meaning
    of the second line, rendered “when you meet your friends again,” is “when you are living together again.”</p>

  <p>This song has a very pretty tune. The Cheyenne claim to have lived originally in the north on a stream known to
    them as the “River of Turtles.” Reverend H. R. Voth, former missionary among the Cheyenne and Arapaho, states that
    the Indians say that along the banks of this stream were clays of different colors which they used for paint. In a
    letter of October 1, 1891, he says: “I have now in my possession some red and some gray or drab paint that Black
    Coyote brought with him from the north, which he claims came from that ancient Turtle river, and which the Indians
    are now using to paint themselves. They say there are more than two kinds of color at that river, or at least used
    to be.” According to <a href="#Clark">Clark</a> (<i>Indian Sign Language</i>, page 99) the oldest traditions of the Cheyenne locate their
    former home on the headwaters of the Mississippi in Minnesota, about where Saint Paul now is. Other facts
    corroborate this testimony, and the traditional “Turtle river” would seem to be identical with the Saint Croix,
    which is thus described by Coxe in 1741:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A little higher up is the river Chabadeda, above which the Meschacebe makes a fine lake twenty miles long and
      eight or ten broad. Nine or ten miles above that lake, on the east side, is a large fair river, called the river
      of Tortoises, after you have entered a little way, which leads far into the country to the northeast, and is
      navigable by the greatest boats forty miles. About the same distance farther up, the Meschacebe is precipitated
      from the rocks about fifty feet, but is so far navigable by considerable ships, as also beyond, excepting another
      fall, eighty or ninety miles higher, by large vessels, unto its sources, which are in the country of the Sieux,
      not <span class="pagenum" id="Page_1030">1030</span>at a very great distance from Hudson’s bay. There are
      many other smaller rivers which fall into the Meschacebe, on both sides of it, but being of little note, and the
      description of them of small consequence, I have passed over them in silence. (Coxe, Carolana, 1741, in French’s
      Hist. Coll. of La., part 2, 233, 1850.)</p>

  <p>Quite a number of the Cheyenne ghost songs refer to rivers seen in the spirit world, these being frequently
    designated by colors, as yellow, blue, etc. It may be that certain rivers play a prominent part in their mythology,
    and as has been said they locate their earliest traditional home on the “Turtle river.” The word here rendered
    “blue-green” might mean either blue or green, as in Cheyenne and in many other Indian languages the two colors are
    not differentiated. Compare <a href="#Cheyenne_16">Cheyenne song number 16</a>.</p>

  <p>This song refers to the crazy dance, which the author of the song saw the former warriors of his tribe performing
    in the spirit world. The crazy dance, called <i>Psam</i> by the Cheyenne and <i>Ahaka′wŭ</i> by the Arapaho,
    belonged to one order of the military organization already described in treating of the Arapaho songs.
    (See <a href="#Arapaho_43">Arapaho song 43</a>.) The name in both languages is derived from the word for “crazy.” Men, women, and children took part in the
    ceremony, dressed in skins or other costume to represent various animals, as buffaloes, panthers, deer, and birds,
    with one bear, two foxes, and seven wolves, besides two “medicine wolves.” Each strove to imitate the animal
    personated in action as well as in appearance. It was the business of the two foxes to be continually running and
    stumbling over the others in their efforts to escape from the crowd. The dance, whose essential feature was the
    doing of everything by contraries, had its parallel among many eastern tribes, particularly among the old Huron and
    Iroquois. It was considered the most picturesque and amusing dance among the prairie tribes. The “half buffalo” of
    the song refers to the robe worn by certain of the dancers, which consisted of the upper half of a buffalo skin, the
    head portion, with the horns attached, coming over the head of the dancers. The dance was an exhibition of
    deliberate craziness in which the performers strove to outdo one another in nonsensical and frenzied actions,
    particularly in constantly doing the exact opposite of what they were told to do. It was performed only in obedience
    to a vow made by some person for the recovery of a sick child, for a successful war expedition, or for some other
    Indian blessing. It lasted four days, the performers dancing naked the first three days and in full dance costume on
    the fourth. The leaders in the absurdities were two performers whose bodies and cheeks were painted with white clay,
    and whose ears were filled with hair shed by the buffalo, which was believed to confer strong “medicine” powers.
    They carried whistles, and shot at the spectators with blunt arrows. Almost every license was permitted to these
    two, who in consequence were really held in dread by the others. Among other things the crazy dancers were
    accustomed to dance through a fire until they extinguished it by their tramping. This was done in imitation of the
    fire-moth, called <i>aha′kăa′</i>, “crazy,” by the Arapaho, which hovers about a flame or fire and finally flies
    into it. They also handled poisonous snakes, and sometimes, it is said, would even surround and kill a buffalo by
    their unaided physical strength. The Cheyenne dance differed somewhat from that of the Arapaho. It was last
    performed in the south about ten years ago.</p>

  <p>The whirlwind is regarded with reverence by all the prairie tribes. In the mythology of the Ghost dance it seems to
    be an important factor in assisting the onward progress of the new world and the spirit army. It is mentioned also
    in several Arapaho ghost songs.</p>

  <p>Red is a sacred color with all Indians, and is usually symbolic of strength and success, and for this reason is a
    favorite color in painting the face and body for the dance or warpath, and for painting the war pony, the lance,
    etc. On all important occasions, when painting the face or body, the skin is first anointed with grease to make the
    paint adhere better, so as not to obscure the sharp lines of the design.</p>

  <p>This song was also composed by Mo′‛ki, “Little Woman,” the wife of Grant Left-hand. On account of her frequent
    trances and consequent leadership in the Cheyenne Ghost dance, she assumes the title of the Crow Woman, i.&nbsp;e., the
    woman messenger from the spirit world. The story of her own and her husband’s connection with the Ghost dance is of
    interest for the light it throws on the working of the Indian mind, especially with regard to religion.</p>

  <p>Mo′‛ki is a young Cheyenne woman married to a young Arapaho, Grant Left-hand, about 30 years of age, a former
    Carlisle student, and the son of Nawat, or Left-hand, the principal chief of the southern Arapaho. Notwithstanding
    several years of English education, Grant is a firm believer in the doctrine and the dance, and the principal
    organizer and leader of the auxiliary “crow dance” in his own tribe, while his wife is as prominent in the Ghost
    dance among the Cheyenne, and has composed a series of a dozen or more songs descriptive of her various trance
    experiences in the other world.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1039">1039</span></p>

  <p>Her first child died soon after birth, and the young mother was keenly affected by the bereavement. Afterward a boy
    was born to them, and became the idol of his parents, especially of the father. He grew up into a bright and active
    little fellow, but when about 4 years of age was suddenly seized with a spasm in the night and died in a few
    minutes, almost before his father could reach his bed. This second loss brought deep sorrow to them both, and the
    mother brooded over it so that there was serious fear for her own life. Then came the Ghost dance and the new
    doctrine of a reunion with departed friends. The mother went to the dance, fell into a trance, met her children as
    in life, and played with her little boy. On awaking and returning home she told her husband. He could hardly believe
    it at first, but it required but little persuasion to induce him to attend the next Ghost dance with her, because,
    as he said, “I want to see my little boy.” He himself fell into a trance, saw his children, and rode with his little
    boy on the horse behind him over the green prairies of the spirit land. From that time both became devoted adherents
    and leaders of the Ghost dance; their trances have been frequent, and every dance is welcomed as another opportunity
    of reunion with departed friends. The young man was deeply affected as he spoke of his love for his children, the
    sudden death of the little boy, and their second meeting in the other world, and as his wife sat by his side looking
    up into our faces and listening intently to every word, although she understood but little English, it could not be
    doubted that their faith in the reality of the vision was real and earnest. Every Indian parent who has lost a
    child, every child who has lost a parent, and every young man and woman who has lost a brother, sister, or friend
    affirms a similar reason for belief in the Ghost dance.</p>

  <h4 id="Comanche_sign">TRIBAL SIGN</h4>

  <p>The tribal sign for the Comanche is “snakes,” the same as that for the Shoshoni, but with the finger drawn toward
    the rear instead of thrust forward.</p>

  <h4 id="Comanche_sketch">SKETCH OF THE TRIBE</h4>

  <p>The Comanche are one of the southern tribes of the great Shoshonean stock, and the only one of that group living
    entirely on the plains. Their language and traditions show that they are a comparatively recent offshoot from the
    Shoshoni of Wyoming, both tribes speaking practically the same dialect and until very recently keeping up<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_1044">1044</span> constant and friendly communication. Within the traditionary
    period the two tribes lived adjacent to each other in southern Wyoming, since which time the Shoshoni have been
    beaten back into the mountains by the Sioux and other prairie tribes, while the Comanche have been driven steadily
    southward by the same pressure. In this southern migration the Pe′nätĕka seem to have preceded the rest of the
    tribe. The Kiowa say that when they themselves moved southward from the Black-hills region, the Arkansas was the
    northern boundary of the Comanche.</p>

  <p>In 1719 the Comanche are mentioned under their Siouan name of Pa′douca as living in what now is western Kansas. It
    must be remembered that from 500 to 800 miles was an ordinary range for a prairie tribe, and that the Comanche were
    equally at home on the Platte and in the Bolson de Mapimi of Chihuahua. As late as 1805 the North Platte was still
    known as Padouca fork. At that time they roamed over the country about the heads of the Arkansas, Red, Trinity, and
    Brazos rivers, in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. For nearly two hundred years they were at war with the
    Spaniards of Mexico and extended their raids far down into Durango. They were friendly to the Americans generally,
    but became bitter enemies of the Texans, by whom they were dispossessed of their best hunting grounds, and carried
    on a relentless war against them for nearly forty years. They have been close confederates of the Kiowa for perhaps
    one hundred and fifty years. In 1835 they made their first treaty with the government, and by the treaty of Medicine
    Lodge in 1867 agreed to go on their present reservation, situated between Washita and Red rivers, in the
    southwestern part of Oklahoma; but it was not until after the last outbreak of the southern prairie tribes in
    1874–75 that they and their allies, the Kiowa and Apache, finally settled on it. They were probably never a large
    tribe, although supposed to be populous on account of their wide range. Within the last fifty years they have been
    terribly wasted by war and disease. They numbered 1,512 in 1893.</p>

  <p>The gentile system seems to be unknown among the Comanche. They have, or still remember, thirteen recognized
    divisions or bands, and may have had others in former times. Of these all but five are practically extinct. The
    Kwă′hări and Pe′nätĕka are the most important. Following in alphabetic order is the complete list as given by their
    leading chiefs:</p>

  <p>1. <i>Detsăna′yuka</i> or <i>No′koni</i>. This band, to which the present head chief Quanah Parker belongs, was
    formerly called <i>No′koni</i>, “wanderers,” but on the death of Quanah’s father, whose name was also No′koni, the
    name was tabued, according to Comanche custom, and the division took the name of <i>Detsăna′yuka</i>, “bad campers,”
    intended to convey the same idea of wandering.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Ditsä′kăna</i>, <i>Wĭ′dyu</i>, <i>Yäpä</i>, or <i>Yä′mpäri′ka</i>. This division was formerly known as
    <i>Wĭ′dyu</i>, “awl,” but for a reason similar to that just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1045">1045</span>
    mentioned the name was changed to <i>Ditsä′kăna</i>, “sewers,” which conveys the same idea, an awl being the
    substitute for a needle. They are equally well known as <i>Yäpä</i>, the Comanche name of the root of the <i>Carum
    gairdneri</i>, known to the Shoshoni and Bannock as <i>yampa</i>, or sometimes as <i>Yämpä-ri′ka</i>, a dialectic
    form signifying “yampa eaters.” The whole Comanche tribe is known to the Shoshoni under the name of <i>Yä′mpaini</i>
    or <i>Yämpai-rĭ′kani</i>, “yampa people” or “yampa eaters.” The Yäpä are sometimes known also as
    <i>Etsitü′biwat</i>, “northerners,” or “people of the cold country,” from having usually ranged along the northern
    frontier of the tribal territory; a fact which may account for the Shoshoni having designated the whole tribe by
    their name.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Kewa′tsăna.</i> “No ribs;” extinct.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Kotsa′i.</i> Extinct.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Ko′tso-tĕ′ka.</i> “Buffalo eaters,” from <i>ko′tso</i>, buffalo, and <i>tĕ′ka</i>, the root of the verb “to
    eat.”</p>

  <p>6. <i>Kwa′hări</i> or <i>Kwa′hădi</i>. “Antelopes.” This division was one of the most important of the tribe, and
    was so called because its members frequented the prairie country and the staked plains, while the Pe′nätĕka and
    others ranged farther east on the edge of the timber region. They were the last to come in after the surrender in
    1874. The Kwa′hări, Ditsä′kana, and Detsăna′yuka were sometimes designated together by the whites as northern
    Comanche as distinguished from the Pe′nätĕka, who were known as eastern or southern Comanche.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Motsai′.</i> Perhaps from <i>pä-motsan</i>, “a loop in a stream.” These and the Tĕna′wa were practically
    exterminated in a battle with the Mexicans about 1845.</p>

  <p>8. <i>Pä′gatsû.</i> “Head of the stream” (<i>pä</i>, a stream); extinct.</p>

  <p>9. <i>Pe′nätĕka</i>, or <i>Penä′nde</i>. “Honey eaters.” These and the Kwa′hări were the two most important
    divisions in the tribe. They lived on the edge of the timber country in eastern Texas, and hence were frequently
    known to the whites as eastern or southern Comanche. They had but a loose alliance with their western kinsmen, and
    sometimes joined the Texans against them. Other Comanche names for them are <i>Te′yuwĭt</i>, “hospitable;”
    <i>Tĕ′‛kăpwai</i>, “no meat,” and <i>Ku′baratpat</i>, “steep climbers.”</p>

  <p>10. <i>Po′hoi.</i> “Wild-sage people,” i.&nbsp;e., Shoshoni. This is not properly the name of a Comanche division, but
    of some immigrant Shoshoni from the north incorporated with the Comanche.</p>

  <p>11. <i>Tänĭ′ma.</i> “Liver eaters,” from <i>nĭm</i> or <i>nüm</i>, liver. This band is extinct, only one old man
    being known to survive.</p>

  <p>12. <i>Tĕna′wa</i> or <i>Te′nähwĭt</i>. From <i>tĕ′näw’</i>, “down stream.” Extinct. See <i>Motsai′</i> above.</p>

  <p>13. <i>Wa-ai′h.</i> “Maggot.” Extinct.</p>

  <p>The Comanche were nomad buffalo hunters, constantly on the move, cultivating nothing from the ground, and living in
    skin tipis. Excepting that they are now confined to a reservation and forced to depend on government rations, they
    are but little changed from their original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1046">1046</span> condition. They are
    still for the most part living in tipis of canvas, and are dressed in buckskin. They were long noted as the finest
    horsemen of the plains, and bore a reputation for dash and courage. They have a high sense of honor, and hold
    themselves superior to the other tribes with which they are associated. In person they are well built and rather
    corpulent. Their language is the trade language of the region, and is more or less understood by all the neighboring
    tribes. It is sonorous and flowing, its chief characteristic being a rolling <i>r</i>. It has no <i>l</i>. The
    language has several dialects, and is practically the same as that of the Shoshoni in the north. Their present head
    chief is Quanah Parker, an able man, whose mother was an American captive. His name, <i>Kwäna</i> or <i>Kwai′na</i>,
    signifies a sweet smell.</p>

  <p>Having taken but little part in the Ghost dance, the Comanche have but few songs in their own language, but these
    are particularly pleasing for their martial ring or soothing softness. They call the dance <i>A′p-Anĕ‛ka′ra</i>,
    “the father’s dance” (from <i>a′pă</i>, father; <i>nĕ‛ka′ra</i>, a dance), or by another name which signifies the
    “dance with joined hands.”</p>

  <p>This song was probably sung at daylight, when the first rays of the sun shone in the east, after the dancers had
    been dancing all night. The introductory part is a suggestion from the songs of the mescal rite, to which the
    Comanche are so much attached. Although the words convey but little meaning, the tune is unique and one of the best
    of all the ghost songs on account of its sprightly measure.</p>

  <p><i>Te′äyä</i> refers to the sun’s rays or beams; <i>torä′bi</i>, a possessive form of <i>tä′bi</i>, sun;

      collective name of Diggers.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h4 id="Paiute_sketch">SKETCH OF THE PAIUTE</h4>

  <h5 id="Paiute_characteristics">CHARACTERISTICS</h5>

  <p>The Paiute belong to the great Shoshonean stock and occupy most of Nevada, together with adjacent portions of
    southwestern Utah, northwestern Arizona, and northwestern and southeastern California. The Pahvant and Gosiute on
    their eastern border are frequently, but improperly, classed as Paiute, while the Chemehuevi, associated with the
    Walapai in Arizona, are but a southern offshoot of the Paiute and speak the same language. With regard to the
    Indians of Walker River and Pyramid Lake reservations, who constitute the main body of those commonly known as
    Paiute, Powell claims that they are not Paiute at all, but another tribe which he calls Paviotso. He says: “The
    names by which the tribes are known to white men and the department give no clue to the relationship of the Indians.
    For example, the Indians in the vicinity of the reservation on the Muddy and the Indians on the Walker River and
    Pyramid Lake reservations are called Pai or Pah Utes, but the Indians know only those on the Muddy by that name,
    while those on the other two reservations are known as Paviotsoes, and speak a very different language, but closely
    allied to, if not identical with, that of the Bannocks.” (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 45.</i>) The Ghost dance originated among these
    Indians in the neighborhood of Walker river, from whom the songs here given were obtained, and for convenience of
    reference we shall speak of them under their popular title of Paiute, without asserting its correctness.</p>

  <p>The different small bands have little political coherence and there is no recognized head chief. The most
    influential chiefs among them in modern times have been Winnemucca, who died a few years ago, and Natchez. Wovoka’s
    leadership is spiritual, not political. The Indians of Walker river and Pyramid lake claim the Bannock as their
    cousins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1049">1049</span> and say that they speak the same language. As a rule
    they have been peaceable and friendly toward the whites, although in the early sixties they several times came into
    collision with miners and emigrants, hostility being frequently provoked by the whites themselves. The northern
    Paiute are more warlike than those of the south, and a considerable number of them took part with the Bannock in the
    war of 1878. Owing to the fact that the great majority of the Paiute are not on reservations, many of them being
    attached to the ranches of white men, it is impossible to get any correct statement of their population,<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_1050">1050</span> but they may be safely estimated at from 7,000 to 8,000 and are
    thought to be increasing. In 1893 those on reservations, all in Nevada, were reported to number, at Walker River,
    563; at Pyramid Lake, 494; at Duck Valley (Western Shoshone agency, in connection with the Shoshoni), 209. Nevada
    Indians off reservation were estimated to number 6,815, nearly all of whom were Paiute.</p>

  <figure class="illowp77" id="fig_101">
    <img class="figbox1" src="images/fig101.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 101</span>—Paiute wikiup.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>As a people the Paiute are peaceable, moral, and industrious, and are highly commended for their good qualities by
    those who have had the best opportunities for judging. While apparently not as bright in intellect as the prairie
    tribes, they appear to possess more solidity of character. By their willingness and efficiency as workers, they have
    made themselves necessary to the white farmers and have been enabled to supply themselves with good clothing and
    many of the comforts of life, while on the other hand they have steadily resisted the vices of civilization, so that
    they are spoken of by one agent as presenting the “singular anomaly” of improvement by contact with the whites.
    Another authority says: “To these habits and excellence of character may be attributed the fact that they are
    annually increasing in numbers, and that they are strong, healthy, active people. Many of them are employed as
    laborers on the farms of white men in all seasons, but they are especially serviceable during the time of harvesting
    and hay-making.” (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 46.</i>) They would be the last Indians in the world to preach a crusade of
    extermination against the whites, such as the messiah religion has been represented to be. Aside from their earnings
    among the whites, they derive their subsistence from the fish of the lakes, jack rabbits and small game of the sage
    plains and mountains, and from piñon nuts and other seeds which they grind into flour for bread. Their ordinary
    dwelling is the wikiup or small rounded hut of tulé rushes over a framework of poles, with the ground for a floor
    and the fire in the center and almost entirely open at the top. Strangely enough, although appreciating the
    advantages of civilization so far as relates to good clothing and such food as they can buy at the stores, they
    manifest no desire to live in permanent houses or to procure the furniture of civilization, and their wikiups are
    almost bare of everything excepting a few wicker or grass baskets of their own weaving.</p>

  <p>The Paiute ghost songs have a monotonous, halting movement that renders them displeasing to the ear of a white man,
    and are inferior in expression to those of the Arapaho and the Sioux. A number of words consisting only of unmeaning
    syllables are inserted merely to fill in the meter. Like the cognate Shoshoni and Comanche, the language has a
    strong rolling <i>r</i>.</p>

  <h5 id="Genesis_myth">GENESIS MYTH</h5>

  <p>At first the world was all water, and remained so a long time. Then the water began to go down and at last
    Kura′ngwa (Mount Grant) emerged from the water, near the southwest end of Walker lake. There was fire on its top (it
    may have been a volcano), and when the wind blew hard the water dashed over the fire and would have

    (<i>hutsi</i>—<i>Centrocercus urophasianus</i>) nestled down over it and fanned away the water with her wings. The
    heat scorched the feathers on the breast of the sage-hen and they remain black to this day. Afterward the Paiute got
    their first fire from the mountain through the help of the rabbit, who is a great wonder-worker, “same as a god.” As
    the water subsided other mountains appeared, until at last the earth was left as it is now.</p>

  <p>Then the great ancestor of the Paiute, whom they call <i>Nümi′naă′</i>, “Our Father,” came from the south in the
    direction of Mount Grant, upon which his footprints can still be seen, and journeyed across to the mountains east of
    Carson sink and made his home there. A woman, <i>Ibidsíi</i>, “Our Mother,” followed him from the same direction,
    and they met and she became his wife. They dressed themselves in skins, and lived on the meat of deer and mountain
    sheep, for there was plenty of game in those days. They had children—two boys and two girls. Their father made bows
    and arrows for the boys, and the mother fashioned sticks for the girls with which to dig roots. When the children
    grew up, each boy married his sister, but the two families quarreled until their father told them to separate. So
    one family went to Walker lake and became <i>Aga′ih-tĭka′ra</i>, “fish eaters” (the Paiute of Walker lake), while
    the other family went farther north into Idaho and became <i>Kotso′-tĭkăra</i>, “buffalo eaters” (the Bannock), but
    both are one people and have the same language. After their children had left them, the parents went on to the
    mountains farther east, and there <i>Nüminaă′</i> went up into the sky and his wife followed him.</p>

  <h4 id="The_Washo">THE WASHO</h4>

  <p>Associated with the Paiute are the Washo, or <i>Wâ′siu</i>, as they call themselves, a small tribe of about 400
    souls, and having no affinity, so far as known, with any other Indians. They occupy the mountain region in the
    extreme western portion of Nevada, about Washo and Tahoe lakes and the towns of Carson and Virginia City. They
    formerly extended farther east and south, but have been driven back by the Paiute, who conquered them, reducing them
    to complete subjection and forbidding them the use of horses, a prohibition which was rigidly enforced until within
    a few years. Thus broken in spirit, they became mere hangers-on of the white settlements on the opening up of the
    mines, and are now terribly demoralized. They have been utterly neglected by the government, have never been
    included in any treaty, and have now no home that they can call their own. They are devoted adherents of the
    messiah, but usually join in the dance with the nearest camp of Paiute, whose songs they sing, and have probably no
    Ghost songs in their own language. We quote a gloomy account of their condition in 1866. The description will apply
    equally well today, excepting that their numbers have diminished:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This is a small tribe of about 500 Indians, living in the extreme western part of the state. They are usually a
      harmless people, with much less physical and mental <span class="pagenum" id="Page_1052">1052</span>
      development than the Paiutes, and more degraded morally. They are indolent, improvident, and much
      addicted to the vices and evil practices common in savage life. They manifest an almost uncontrollable appetite
      for intoxicating drinks. They are sensual and filthy, and are annually diminishing in numbers from the diseases
      contracted through their indulgences. A few have learned the English language and will do light work for a
      reasonable compensation. They spend the winter months about the villages and habitations of white men, from whom
      they obtain tolerable supplies of food and clothing. The spring, summer, and autumn months are spent in fishing
      about Washo and Tahoe lakes and the streams which flow through their country. They also gather grass seed and pine
      nuts, hunt rabbits, hares, and ducks. There is no suitable place for a reservation in the bounds of their
      territory, and, in view of their rapidly diminishing numbers and the diseases to which they are subjected, none is
      required. (<i><a href="#Comr">Comr.</a>, 47.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h4 id="Pit_River_Indians">THE PIT RIVER INDIANS</h4>

  <p>Another group of Indians closely associated with the Paiute on the northwest consists of a number of small tribes,
    known collectively to the whites as Pit River or Hot Springs Indians, holding the basin of Pit river in northeastern
    California from Goose lake to the junction with the Sacramento. Among their tribes or bands are the Achoma′wi,
    Huma′whi, Estakéwach, Hantéwa, Chumâ′wa, Atua′mih or Hamefku′ttelli, Ilma′wi, and Pa′kamalli. (<i><a href="#Powers">Powers</a></i>,
    <i>Tribes of California</i>.) They are at present supposed to constitute a distinct linguistic group, but it is
    probable that better information will show their affinity with some of the neighboring Californian stocks. With the
    exception of a few at Round Valley reservation, California, none of them are on reservations or have any official
    recognition by the government. They probably number 1,000 to 1,500 souls. The northern bands have suffered much from
    Modoc slave raids in former days, and are much inferior in physique and intellect to those lower down the river, who
    were the terror of northern California thirty years ago, and who are described by recent observers as good workers,
    intelligent, brave, and warlike. (<i><a href="#AGO">A. G. O.</a>, 9.</i>)</p>

  <p>This is one of the favorite songs of the Paiute Ghost dance. The tune has a plaintive but rather pleasing effect,
    although inferior to the tunes of most of the ghost songs of the prairie tribes. The words as they stand are very
    simple, but convey a good deal of meaning to the Indian. It must be remembered that the dance is held in the open
    air at night, with the stars shining down on the wide-extending plain walled in by the giant sierras, fringed at the
    base with dark pines, and with their peaks white with eternal snows. Under such circumstances this song of the snow
    lying white upon the mountains, and the Milky Way stretching across the clear sky, brings up to the Paiute the same
    patriotic home love that comes from lyrics of singing birds and leafy trees and still waters to the people of more
    favored regions. In the mythology of the Paiute, as of many other tribes, the Milky Way is the road of the dead to
    the spirit world. <i>Ro′răni′</i> serves merely to fill in the meter.</p>

  <h4 id="Sioux_sketch">SKETCH OF THE TRIBE</h4>

  <p>The Sioux constitute the largest tribe in the United States, and are too well known to need an extended description
    here. Although now thought of chiefly as a prairie tribe, their emergence upon the plains is comparatively recent,
    and within the historic period their range extended as far eastward as central Wisconsin, from which, and most of
    Minnesota, they have been driven out by the westward advance of the Ojibwa. There is ground for believing that the
    true home of the whole Siouan stock is not in the west, or even in the central region, but along the south Atlantic
    slope. (See the author’s <i>Siouan Tribes of the East</i>.)</p>

  <p>The Sioux language has three well-marked dialects—the eastern or Santee, the middle or Yankton (including the
    Asiniboin in the north), and the western or Teton. The tribe consists of seven great divisions, each of which again
    has or had subdivisions. Dorsey enumerates over one hundred in all. Each grand division had its own camping circle,
    and when two or more such divisions camped together they usually camped in concentric circles. (<i>Dorsey.</i>) The
    seven great divisions are: 1. <i>Mde-wakañ-toñwañ</i> (Medewacanton), “village of the Spirit lake;” 2.
    <i>Waqpekute</i> (Wahpacoota), “leaf shooters;” 3. <i>Waqpetoñwañ</i> (Wahpeton), “leaf village;” 4.
    <i>Sisitoñwañ</i> (Sisseton), variously rendered “slimy village” or “swamp village;” 5. <i>Ihanktoñwañ</i>
    (Yankton), “end village;” 6. <i>Ihanktoñwañna</i> (Yanktonais), “upper end village;” 7. <i>Titoñwañ</i> (Teton),
    “prairie village.”</p>

  <p>The first four divisions collectively are known as Isañati or Santee Sioux. The name is supposed to be derived from
    <i>isañ</i>, the dialectic word for “knife.” They formerly held Mississippi, Minnesota, and upper Red rivers in
    Minnesota and were afterward gathered on reservations at Devils lake, North Dakota; Lake Traverse (Sisseton agency)
    and Flandreau, South Dakota; and Santee agency, Nebraska. Those at Lake Traverse and Flandreau have now taken
    allotments as citizens.</p>

  <p>The Yankton and Yanktonais, together speaking the middle dialect, occupied chiefly the country of James river, east
    of the Missouri, in North Dakota and South Dakota and extending into Iowa. They are now on Yankton and Crow Creek
    reservations in South Dakota, and Fort Peck reservation, Montana.</p>

  <p>The Teton constitute more than two-thirds of the whole Sioux tribe, and held nearly the whole country southwest of
    the Missouri from Cannonball river to the South Platte, extending westward beyond the Black hills. They are all now
    on reservations in South and North Dakota. They are again subdivided into seven principal divisions: 1.
    <i>Sichañgu</i>, “burnt thighs” (Brulés), now on Rosebud reservation; 2. <i>Ogalala</i>, referring to “scattering”
    of dust in the face (Clark), now on Pine Ridge reservation, under the celebrated chief Red Cloud
    (<i>Maqpe-Luta</i>); 3. <i>Hunkpapa</i>, “those who camp at the end (or opening)<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_1059">1059</span> of the camping circle” (Clark), on Standing Rock reservation; 4. <i>Minikañzu</i>,
    “those who plant by the water,” on Cheyenne River reservation; 5. <i>Itazipko</i>, “without bows” (Sans Arcs), on
    Cheyenne River reservation; 6. <i>Sihasapa</i>, “black feet” (not to be confounded with the Blackfoot tribe), on
    Cheyenne River and Standing Rock reservations; 7. <i>Ohenoñpa</i>, “two kettles,” on Cheyenne River and Rosebud
    reservations. According to the official report for 1893, the Sioux within the United States number about 23,410,
    which, with 600 permanently settled in Manitoba, make the whole population about 24,000 souls.</p>

  <p>The Sioux, under the name of Nadouessi, are mentioned by the Jesuit missionaries as early as 1632. They made their
    first treaties with our government in 1815. The most prominent events in their history since that date have been the
    treaty of Prairie du Chien in 1825, which defined their eastern boundary and stopped the westward advance of the
    Ojibwa; the Minnesota massacre of 1862, which resulted in the expulsion of the Sioux from Minnesota; the Sioux war
    of 1876–77, largely consequent on the unauthorized invasion of the Black hills by miners, and the chief incident of
    which was the defeat and massacre of an entire detachment under General Custer; the treaty by which the great
    reservation was broken up in 1889, and the outbreak of 1890, with the massacre of Wounded Knee.</p>

  <p>By reason of their superior numbers the Sioux have always assumed, if not exercised, the lordship over all the
    neighboring tribes with the exception of the Ojibwa, who, having acquired firearms before the Sioux, were enabled to
    drive the latter from the headwaters of the Mississippi, and were steadily pressing them westward when stopped by
    the intervention of the United States government. The Sioux in turn drove the Cheyenne, Crow, Kiowa, and others
    before them and forced them into the mountains or down into the southern prairies. The eastern bands were sedentary
    and largely agricultural, but the Teton were solely and preeminently wandering buffalo hunters. All dwelt in
    <i>tipis</i>—the word is from the Sioux language—which were of bark in the timber country and of buffalo skins on
    the plains. In warlike character they are probably second only to the Cheyenne, and have an air of proud superiority
    rather unusual with Indians. Clark says of them, “In mental, moral, and physical qualities I consider the Sioux a
    little lower but still nearly equal to the Cheyenne, and the Teton are the superior branch of the family.”
    (<i>Indian Sign Language</i>, 345.) The eastern Sioux are now far advanced toward civilization through the efforts
    of teachers and missionaries for over a generation, and the same is true in a less degree of the Yankton, while the
    majority of the Teton are still nearly in their original condition.</p>

  <p>I found the Sioux very difficult to approach on the subject of the Ghost dance. This was natural, in view of the
    trouble that had resulted to them in consequence of it. When I was first at Pine Ridge, the troops still camped
    there served as a reminder of the conflict, while in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1060">1060</span> the little
    cemetery at the agency were the fresh graves of the slain soldiers, and only a few miles away was the Wounded Knee
    battlefield and the trench where the bodies of nearly three hundred of their people had been thrown. To my questions
    the answer almost invariably was, “The dance was our religion, but the government sent soldiers to kill us on
    account of it. We will not talk any more about it.” Another reason for their unwillingness was the fact that most of
    the interpreters were from the eastern or Santee portion of the tribe, and looked with contempt on the beliefs and
    customs of their more primitive western brethren, between whom and themselves there was in consequence but little
    friendly feeling. On one occasion, while endeavoring to break the ice with one of the initiates of the dance, I told
    him how willingly the Arapaho had given me information and even invited me to join in the dance. “Then,” said he,
    “don’t you find that the religion of the Ghost dance is better than the religion of the churches?” I could not well
    say yes, and hesitated a moment to frame an answer. He noticed it at once and said very deliberately, “Well, then,
    if you have not learned that you have not learned anything about it,” and refused to continue the conversation.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The Sioux ghost songs are all in the dialect of the Teton, who took the most active interest in the dance, which
    was hardly known among the bands east of the Missouri. The vocalic character of the language,<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_1061">1061</span> and the frequent liquid <i>l</i> of this dialect, renders these songs peculiarly
    musical, while for beauty of idea and expression they are second only to those of the Arapaho.</p>

  <p>This song refers to the sacred pipe which, according to the Sioux tradition, was brought to them by a mysterious
    young woman from the spirit world. The story, as outlined by Captain J. M. Lee, is as follows: In the old times the
    Sioux were always at war, not only with other tribes, but also among themselves. On one occasion two young men were
    out hunting when they saw a young woman approaching them with folded arms. Seeing that she was not of their own
    tribe, one proposed to the other that they kill her, but he refused and urged that they wait until they learned what
    she wanted. The first speaker, however, was about to kill her as she drew near, when she suddenly stooped down and
    took from around her ankle something resembling an anklet, which she waved about her head. The motion was so rapid
    that it seemed as though a cloud encircled her for a few moments, when she ceased, and the snake which she had taken
    from off her ankle glided away through the grass. But the young warrior who had thought to kill her had disappeared,
    swept from the face of the earth.</p>

  <p>Turning now to his companion, she said, “To you I come as a friend and helper. Your people have been killing each
    other. I bring you a pipe, which is a token of peace,” and she held out a pipe as she spoke. “When you smoke it your
    thoughts will be of peace, and no murderer (i.&nbsp;e., no one who kills a member of his own tribe) must be allowed to
    smoke it.” She returned with him to his village, where the women prepared for her reception a large tipi, to which
    the chiefs of the tribe came to listen to her instructions. She taught them to be at peace with<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_1063">1063</span> one another, if they would be happy, and when they listened to her words and
    accepted her teachings, she gave them the sacred medicine pipe to smoke thenceforth in their councils as a perpetual
    reminder of the peace covenant of the Lakota. Her mission now ended, she said she must leave them, and although they
    begged her earnestly to stay with them, she could not tarry longer, but disappeared as suddenly and mysteriously as
    she had come.</p>

  <p>A variant of this legend is given by Colonel Mallery in his paper in the Tenth Annual Report of the Bureau of
    Ethnology, where it is illustrated by a colored plate from a picture by the Indian story teller. According to this
    version, the pipe maiden was the mysterious white Buffalo Cow, and brought, with the pipe, a package of four grains
    of maize of different colors. This corn sprang from the milk which dropped from her udder, and was thus, with the
    flesh of the buffalo itself, appointed from the beginning to be the food of all the red tribes. The seeming snakes
    about her waist and ankles were really blades of grass (corn?). She taught the people to call her “grandmother,” a
    reverential title among Indians, and after leading them to her relatives, the buffalo, she faded from their sight as
    they stood gazing at her.</p>

  <p>The pipe holds an important part in the mythology and ritual of almost all our tribes, east and west, and no great
    ceremony is complete and no treaty was ever ratified without it. It is generally symbolic of peace and truth. As a
    peace emblem, it was formerly carried by every bearer of a friendly message from one tribe to another and was smoked
    in solemn ratification of treaties, the act of smoking being itself in the nature of an oath. Among the prairie
    tribes an individual accused of crime is offered the sacred pipe, and if he accepts it and smokes he is declared
    innocent, as no Indian would dare to smoke it if guilty. The ordinary ceremonial pipe of the prairie tribes is made
    of the red stone, known as catlinite, from the famous pipestone quarry in Minnesota in the old country of the Sioux.
    The peace pipe of the Cherokee was made of a white stone, somewhat resembling talc, from a quarry near Knoxville,
    Tennessee. It is said to have had seven stem holes, emblematic of the seven clans of the Cherokee, and was smoked by
    seven counselors at the same time. In every case the tribe has a legend to account for the origin of the pipe. A
    flat pipe is the tribal “medicine” of the Arapaho, and is still preserved with the northern band in Wyoming. (See
    Arapaho songs 1 and 2.) Besides the stone pipe, there are also in use pipes of clay or bone, as well as cigarettes,
    but as a rule no ceremonial character attaches to these. In ceremonial smoking the pipe is passed around the circle
    of councilors, each of whom takes only a few whiffs and then hands it to his neighbor. Each one as he receives the
    pipe offers it first to the sun, holding the bowl up toward the sky and saying, “Grandfather, smoke;” then to the
    earth, the fire, and perhaps also to each of the four cardinal points and to one or another of their mythologic
    heroes. Among the Kiowa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1064">1064</span> I have seen a man hold up the pipe to
    the sky, saying, “Smoke, Sinti” (Sinti being their great mythologic trickster), and then in the same way, “Smoke,
    Jesus.”</p>

  <p>In the Ghost dance at Rosebud and Pine Ridge, as usually performed, a young woman stood in the center of the circle
    holding out a pipe toward the messiah in the west, and remained thus throughout the dance. Another young woman
    usually stood beside her holding out a <i>bäqati</i> wheel (see <a href="#Arapaho_49">Arapaho song 49</a>) in the same way. This feature of
    the dance is said to have been introduced by Short Bull.</p>

  <p>This song brings up a vivid picture of the old Indian life. In her trance vision the old grandmother whose
    experience it relates came upon her friends in the spirit world just as all the women of the camp were engaged in
    cutting up the meat for drying after a successful buffalo hunt. In her joy she calls for her knife to assist in the
    work, and says that as soon as the meat is dry she will make some pemmican.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>In the old days an Indian camp during the cutting up of the meat after a buffalo hunt was a scene of the most
    joyous activity, some faint recollection of which still lingers about ration day at the agency. Thirty years ago,
    when a grand hunt was contemplated, preparations were made for days and weeks ahead. Couriers were sent out to
    collect the neighboring bands at a common rendezvous, medicine-men began their prayers and ceremonies to attract the
    herd, the buffalo songs were sung, and finally when all was ready the confederated bands or sometimes the whole
    tribe—men, women, children, horses, dogs, and travois—moved out into the buffalo grounds. Here the immense camp of
    hundreds of tipis was set up, more ceremonies were performed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1067">1067</span>
    and the mounted warriors rode out in a body to surround and slaughter the herd. The women followed close after them
    to strip the hides from the fresh carcasses and cut out the choice portion of the meat and tallow and bring it into
    camp. Here the meat was cut into thin strips and hung upon frames of horizontal poles to dry, while the tallow was
    stripped off in flakes. In the dry prairie atmosphere one day is usually sufficient to cure the meat, without the
    aid of salt or smoke. When thus dried it is known as “jerked beef.” While the meat is fresh, for the first day or
    two the camp is a scene of constant feasting, the juicy steaks or the sweet ribs being kept broiling over the coals
    in one tipi or another until far into the night. It is the harvest home of the prairie tribes. As soon as the meat
    is dry, the tipis are taken down and packed into the wagons along with the meat, and one family after another starts
    for home until in a short time the great camp is a thing of the past.</p>

  <p>The jerked beef or venison is commonly prepared for eating by being boiled until reasonably tender. In eating, the
    Indian takes a strip thus cooked, dips one end into a soup made by dissolving some salt in warm water, takes the
    portion thus salted between his teeth, and saws off enough for a mouthful with a knife held in his other hand.
    Between mouthfuls he takes bites from a strip of dried tallow placed in the dish with the meat.</p>

  <p>For pemmican the jerked beef or other meat is toasted over a fire until crisp and is then pounded into a hash with
    a stone hammer. In the old times a hole was dug in the ground and a buffalo hide was staked over so as to form a
    skin dish, into which the meat was thrown to be pounded. The hide was that from the neck of the buffalo, the
    toughest part of the skin, the same used for shields, and the only part which would stand the wear and tear of the
    hammers. In the meantime the marrow bones are split up and boiled in water until all the grease and oil come to the
    top, when it is skimmed off and poured over the pounded beef. As soon as the mixture cools, it is sewed up into skin
    bags (not the ordinary painted parfléche cases) and laid away until needed. It was sometimes buried or otherwise
    cached. Pemmican thus prepared will keep indefinitely. When prepared for immediate use, it is usually sweetened with
    sugar, mesquite pods, or some wild fruit mixed and beaten up with it in the pounding. It is extremely nourishing,
    and has a very agreeable taste to one accustomed to it. On the march it was to the prairie Indian what parched corn
    was to the hunter of the timber tribes, and has been found so valuable as a condensed nutriment that it is
    extensively used by arctic travelers and explorers. A similar preparation is in use upon the pampas of South America
    and in the desert region of South Africa, while the canned beef of commerce is an adaptation from the Indian idea.
    The name comes from the Cree language, and indicates something mixed with grease or fat. (<i>Lacombe.</i>)</p>

  <p>This touching song was a favorite among the Sioux. It was composed by a young woman who saw her dead mother in the
    other world, and on waking out of her trance vision implores the mother to come back to them again, as her little
    brother is forever crying after her.</p>

    the old life of the Indians, before they used the guns and other things of the white man. The last line has no
    particular connection with the rest, except as a common refrain of the ghost songs.</p>

  <p>This song may be considered supplementary to the last. In the old times, when going on a buffalo hunt, it was
    customary among the Sioux to send out a small advance party to locate the herd. On finding it, these men at once
    returned at full gallop to the main body of hunters, but instead of stopping on reaching them they dashed past and
    then turned and fell in behind. It is to this custom that the first line refers. The author of the song, on waking
    up in the spirit world, sees the scouting party just dashing in with the news of the presence of the buffalo.
    Everyone at once prepares to join the hunt and “the father” commands him to make (or get ready) his arrows and go
    with them.</p>

  <p>The form of the verb <i>oka′tañna</i> shows that it is a woman speaking, even if we did not learn this from the
    context. To those who know the Indian life it brings up a vivid picture of a prairie band on the march, halting at
    noon or in the evening. As soon as the halt is called by some convenient stream, the women jump down and release the
    horses from the wagons (or the travois in the old times, and hobble them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1074">

    over them, and drive in the pegs around the bottom and the wooden pins up the side, other women take axes and
    buckets and go down to the creek for wood and water. When they return, they find the tipis set up and the blankets
    spread out upon the grass, and in a few minutes fires are built and the meal is in preparation. The woman who
    composed the song evidently in her vision accompanied her former friends on such a march.</p>

  <h4 id="Kiowa_sign">KIOWA TRIBAL SIGN</h4>

  <p>The Kiowa tribal sign indicates “hair cut off at right ear,” in allusion to a former custom of the warriors. From a
    careless habit in making this sign it has sometimes been wrongly interpreted to mean “foolish,” or “rattle-brain.”</p>

  <h4 id="Kiowa_sketch">SKETCH OF THE KIOWA</h4>

  <p>So far as present knowledge goes, the Kiowa constitute a distinct linguistic stock; but it is probable that more
    material will enable us to prove their connection with some tribes farther north, from which direction they came.
    They are noticed in the Spanish records as early at least as 1732. Their oldest tradition, which agrees with the
    concurrent testimony of the Shoshoni and Arapaho, locates them about the junction of Jefferson, Madison, and
    Gallatin forks, at the extreme head of Missouri river, in the neighborhood of the present Virginia<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_1079">1079</span> City, Montana. They afterward moved down from the mountains and
    formed an alliance with the Crow, with whom they have since continued on friendly terms. From here they drifted
    southward along the base of the mountains, driven by the Cheyenne and Arapaho. About 1840 they made peace with the
    latter tribes, with which they have since commonly acted in concert. The Sioux claim to have driven them out of the
    Black hills, and in 1805 they were reported as living upon the North Platte. According to the Kiowa account, when
    they first reached Arkansas river they found their passage opposed by the Comanche, who claimed all the country to
    the south. A war followed, but peace was finally concluded, when the Kiowa crossed over to the south side of the
    Arkansas and formed a confederation with the Comanche, which continues to the present day. In connection with the
    Comanche they carried on a constant war upon the frontier settlements of Mexico and Texas, extending their
    incursions as far south at least as Durango. Among all the prairie tribes they were noted as the most predatory and
    bloodthirsty, and have probably killed more white men in proportion to their numbers than any of the others. They
    made their first treaty with the government in 1837, and were put upon their present reservation jointly with the
    Comanche and Apache in 1868. Their last outbreak was in 1874–75, in connection with the Comanche, Apache, and
    Cheyenne. While probably never very numerous, they have been greatly reduced by war and disease. Their last terrible
    blow came in the spring of 1892, when the measles destroyed over 300 of the three confederated tribes. Their present
    chief is <i>Gu′i-pä′go</i>, Lone Wolf. They occupy the same reservation with the Comanche and Apache, between
    Washita and Red rivers, in southwestern Oklahoma, and numbered 1,017 in 1893.</p>

  <p>The Kiowa do not have the gentile system, and there is no restriction as to intermarriage among the divisions. They
    have six tribal divisions, including the Apache associated with them, who form a component part of the Kiowa camping
    circle. A seventh division, the <i>K̔uăto</i>, is now extinct. The tribal divisions in the order of the camping
    circle are:</p>

  <p>1. <i>K̔a′ta</i>—“biters,” i.&nbsp;e., Arikara or Ree; so called, not because of Arikara origin, but because they were
    more intimate with that tribe in trade and otherwise when the Kiowa lived in the north.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Ko′‛gu′i</i>—“elks.”</p>

  <p>3. <i>Kâ′igwŭ</i>—“Kiowa proper.” This is the oldest division, to which belongs the keeping of the medicine tipi,
    in which is the grand medicine of the tribe.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Kiñep</i>—“big shields.” This is the largest division in the tribe and of corresponding importance.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Semät</i>—“thieves,” the Apache.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Koñtä′lyui</i>—“black boys.” Sometimes also called <i>Si′ndiyu′i</i>, “Sindi’s children.” Said to be of
    darker color than the rest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1080">1080</span> tribe, which, if true, might
    indicate a foreign origin. Sindi is the great mythic hero of the Kiowa.</p>

  <p>7. <i>K̔u′ato</i>—“pulling up from the ground or a hole.” An extinct division, speaking a slightly different
    dialect, and exterminated by the Sioux in one battle about the year 1780. On this occasion, according to tradition,
    the Kiowa were attacked by an overwhelming force of Sioux and prepared to retreat, but the chief of the K̔uato
    exhorted his people not to run, “because, if they did, their relatives in the other world would not receive them.”
    So they stood their ground and were killed, while the others escaped. Their place in the tribal camp circle is not
    known.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>In the annual sun dance and in other great tribal gatherings the several divisions camped in the order shown in
    <a href="#fig_104">figure 104</a>.</p>

  <p>Although brave and warlike, the Kiowa are considered inferior in most respects to the Comanche. In person they are
    dark and heavily built, forming a marked contrast to the more slender and brighter-complexioned prairie tribes
    farther north. Their language is full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1081">1081</span> choking and nasal
    sounds, and is not well adapted to rhythmic composition, for which reason they frequently used the Arapaho songs in
    the Ghost dance, without any clear idea of the meaning or correct pronunciation, although they have quite a number
    of songs of their own.</p>

  <h4 id="Kiowa_Apache">THE KIOWA APACHE</h4>

  <p>A small tribe of Athapascan stock, calling themselves <i>Na′-isha</i> or <i>Na-di′isha-de′na</i>, and popularly
    known as Apache or Kiowa Apache, has been associated with the Kiowa as far back as the traditions of either tribe
    go. While retaining their distinct language, they nearly all speak and understand Kiowa and form a component part of
    the Kiowa camping circle. In dress and general habits of life they are in no way distinguishable. They have come
    from the north with the Kiowa, and are mentioned under the name of Cataka as living in the Black-hills country in
    1805. La Salle speaks of them under the name of Gattacka as early as 1681. There is no reason to suppose that they
    ever formed a part of the Apache proper of Arizona and New Mexico, but are probably, like the Sarsi, a distinct
    Athapascan people who have always lived east of the mountains, and who, having been obliged by weakness of numbers
    to unite themselves with a stronger tribe, have since shared their migratory fortunes southward along the plains.
    The Na-isha are called <i>Ga′taqka</i> by the Pawnee and sometimes by the Wichita; <i>Cataka</i> by Lewis and Clark,
    in 1805; <i>Kataka</i> in their first treaty with the government, made jointly with the Kiowa in 1837;
    <i>Ta′shĭn</i> by the Comanche; <i>Gĭnä′s</i> by the Wichita; <i>Ka′ntsi</i>, “deceivers,” by the Caddo;
    <i>Kĭri′năhĭs</i> by the Kichais; <i>Tha‛kahinĕ′na</i>, “knife-whetting men (?)” by the Arapaho, and
    <i>Mûtsiănătä′niuw′</i>, “whetstone people,” by the Cheyenne. They have several names among the Kiowa, but are
    commonly known by them as <i>Semät</i>, “thieves.” Other Kiowa names for them are <i>Tagu′i</i>, of unknown meaning,
    and <i>Sa′dălso′mte-k̔iñago</i>, “weasel people.” The tribal sign for them, as for the Apache, Lipan, and Navaho,

    epidemic of measles, to 224.</p>

  <p>This song was composed by Pa-guadal, “Red Buffalo,” at a Ghost dance held on Walnut creek in the summer of 1893,
    under the direction of the prophet Pa-iñgya (see <a href="#Page_907">page 907</a>), for the purpose of resurrecting Red Buffalo’s son, who
    had recently died. Pa-iñgya assured the people that if they held the dance as he directed, the dead boy would rise
    up alive from the ground before their eyes. In the dance Red Buffalo became “crazy” and composed this song. In his
    trance he evidently imagined himself a bird. His father was one of the “buffalo doctors,” or surgeons of the tribe,
    who are under the special protection of the buffalo and whose war cry is an imitation of the bellowing of a buffalo
    bull. Red Buffalo claims to have inherited his father’s knowledge; hence his assertion that he bellows like a bull.
    The boy was not resurrected.</p>

  <p>This song gives a pretty picture of the old Indian home life and hospitality. In her dream the woman who composed
    it imagines herself cooking fruit, when the word comes that travelers are approaching, the verb implying that they
    are on the march with their children, dogs, and household property. She stirs the berries around a few times more,
    lifts them out with a spoon of buffalo horn, and goes to offer them to the strangers. The translation is an exact
    paraphrase of the rhythmic repetition of the original. The berry called <i>eyhuñ′i</i>, “principal or best fruit,”
    is not found in the present country of the Kiowa, but is remembered among the pleasant things of their old home in
    the north. It is described as a species of cherry.</p>

  <p>“Pierced nose,” in allusion to their former custom of boring the nose for the insertion of a ring.</p>

  <h4 id="Caddo_sketch">SKETCH OF THE CADDO</h4>

  <p>The Caddo are the principal southern representatives of the Caddoan stock, which includes also the Wichita, Kichai,
    Pawnee, and Arikara. Their confederacy consisted of about a dozen tribes or divisions, claiming as their original
    territory the whole of lower Red river and adjacent country in Louisiana, eastern Texas, and southern Arkansas. The
    names of these twelve divisions, including two of foreign origin, have been preserved as follows:</p>

  <p><i>Kä′dohadä′cho</i> (Caddo proper).</p>

  <p><i>Nädä′ko</i> (Anadarko).</p>

  <p><i>Hai′-nai</i> (Toni).</p>

  <p><i>Nä′bai-dä′cho</i> (Nabedache).</p>

  <p><i>Nä′kohodo′tsi</i> (Nacogdoches).</p>

  <p><i>Näshi′tosh</i> (Natchitoches).</p>

  <p><i>Nä′ka‛na′wan.</i></p>

  <p><i>Hădai′-i</i> (Adai, Adaize).</p>

  <p><i>Hai′-ĭsh</i> (Eyeish, Aliche, Aes).</p>

  <p><i>Yä′tăsi.</i></p>

  <p><i>I′măha</i>—a band of Omaha, or perhaps more probably Kwâpâ, who lived with the Kä′dohadä′cho, but retained their
    own distinct language.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1093">1093</span> There are still a few living with the
    Caddo, but they retain only the name. It will be remembered that when the Caddo lived in eastern Louisiana the
    Arkansas or Kwâpâ were their nearest neighbors on the north, and these Imaha may have been a part of the Kwâpâ who
    lived “up stream” (<i>U′mañhañ</i>) on the Arkansas. The Caddo call the Omaha tribe by the same name.</p>

  <p><i>Yowa′ni</i>—originally a band of the Heyowani division of the Choctaw. They joined the Caddo a long time ago,
    probably about the time the Choctaw began to retire across the Mississippi before the whites. Some few are still
    living with the Caddo and retain their distinct language. There is evidence that some Koasati (Cooshatties) were
    mixed with them.</p>

  <p>The Kä′dohadä′cho seem to be recognized as the principal Caddo division, and the generic term <i>Hasi′nai</i> by
    which the confederates designate themselves is sometimes regarded as belonging more properly to the three divisions
    first named. According to their own statements some of the dialects spoken by the several divisions were mutually
    unintelligible. At present the Kädohadächo and Nädäko are the ruling dialects, while the Näbaidächo, Näkohodotsi,
    Hădai′-i, and Hai′-ĭsh are practically extinct. The Kichai, Bidai, and Akokisa, who formerly lived near the Caddo on
    the eastern border of Texas, did not belong to the confederacy, although at least one of these tribes, the Kichai,
    is of the same stock and is now on the same reservation.</p>

  <p>The Caddo have ten gentes: <i>Na′wotsi</i>, Bear; <i>Tasha</i>, Wolf; <i>Ta′năhă</i>, Buffalo; <i>Ta′o</i>, Beaver;
    <i>Iwi</i>, Eagle; <i>Oăt</i>, Raccoon; <i>Ka′g‛aih</i>, Crow; <i>Ka′găhănĭn</i>, Thunder; <i>Kĭshi</i>, Panther;
    <i>Sûko</i>, Sun. The Bear gens is the most numerous. The Buffalo gens is sometimes called also <i>Koho′</i> or
    Alligator, because both animals bellow in the same way. These of a particular gens will not kill the animal from
    which the gens takes its name, and no Caddo in the old times would kill either an eagle or a panther, although they
    were not afraid to kill the bear, as are so many of the western tribes. The eagle might be killed, however, for its
    feathers by a hunter regularly initiated and consecrated for that purpose.</p>

  <p>The original home of the Caddo was on lower Red river in Louisiana. According to their own tradition, which has
    parallels among several other tribes, they came up from under the ground through the mouth of a cave in a hill which
    they call <i>Cha′‛kanĭ′nă</i>, “The place of crying,” on a lake close to the south bank of Red river, just at its
    junction with the Mississippi. In those days men and animals were all brothers and all lived together under the
    ground. But at last they discovered the entrance to the cave leading up to the surface of the earth, and so they
    decided to ascend and come out. First an old man climbed up, carrying in one hand fire and a pipe and in the other a
    drum. After him came his wife, with corn and pumpkin seeds. Then followed the rest of the people and the animals.
    All intended to come out, but as soon as the wolf had climbed up he closed the hole, and shut up the<span
    class="pagenum" id="Page_1094">1094</span> rest of the people and animals under the ground, where they still
    remain. Those who had come out sat down and cried a long time for their friends below, hence the name of the place.
    Because the Caddo came out of the ground they call it <i>ină′</i>, mother, and go back to it when they die. Because
    they have had the pipe and the drum and the corn and pumpkins since they have been a people, they hold fast to these
    things and have never thrown them away.</p>

  <p>From this place they spread out toward the west, following up the course of Red river, along which they made their
    principal settlements. For a long time they lived on Caddo lake, on the boundary between Louisiana and Texas, their
    principal village on the lake being called Sha′chidĭ′ni, “Timber hill.” Their acquaintance with the whites began at
    a very early period. One of their tribes, the Nädäko, is mentioned under the name of Nandacao in the narrative of De
    Soto’s expedition as early as 1540. The Kädohadächo were known to the French as early as 1687. The relations of the
    Caddo with the French and Spaniards were intimate and friendly. Catholic missions were established among them, about
    the year 1700 and continued to exist until 1812, when the missions were suppressed by the Spanish government and the
    Indians were scattered. In the meantime Louisiana had been purchased by the United States, and the Caddo soon began
    to be pushed away from their ancient villages into the western territory, where they were exposed to the constant
    inroads of the prairie tribes. From this time their decline was rapid, and the events of the Texan and Mexican wars
    aided still further in their demoralization. They made their first treaty with the United States in 1835, at which
    time they were chiefly in Louisiana, southwest of Red river and adjoining Texas. They afterward removed to Brazos
    river in Texas, and to Washita river in Indian Territory in 1859. When the rebellion broke out, the Caddo, not
    wishing to take up arms against the government, fled north into Kansas and remained there until the close of the
    war, when they returned to the Washita. Their present reservation, which they hold only by executive order and
    jointly with the Wichita, lies between Washita and Canadian rivers in western Oklahoma, having the Cheyenne and
    Arapaho on the north and west and the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache on the south. In 1893 they numbered 507.</p>

  <p>In person the Caddo are rather smaller and darker than the neighboring prairie tribes, and from their long
    residence in Louisiana, they have a considerable admixture of French blood. They are an agricultural tribe, raising
    large crops of corn, pumpkins, and melons, and still retaining industrious habits in spite of their many
    vicissitudes of fortune. They were never buffalo hunters until they came out on the plains. They formerly lived in
    conical grass houses like the Wichita, but are now in log houses and generally wear citizen’s dress excepting in the
    dance. The old custom which gave rise to the name and tribal sign of “Pierced Nose” is now obsolete. In 1806 Sibley
    said of them, “They are brave, despise danger or death, and boast that they have<span class="pagenum"
    id="Page_1095">1095</span> never shed white man’s blood.” Their former enemies, the prairie tribes, bear
    witness to their bravery, and their friendship toward the whites is a part of their history, but has resulted in no
    great advantage to themselves, as they have been dispossessed from their own country and are recognized only as
    tenants at will in their present location.</p>

  <p>They and the Wichita received the new doctrine from the Arapaho, and were soon among its most earnest adherents,
    notwithstanding the fact that they were regarded as the most advanced of all the tribes in that part of the country.
    It may be that their history had led them to feel a special need of a messiah. They have been hard and constant
    dancers, at one time even dancing in winter when there was nearly a foot of snow upon the ground. Their first songs
    were those which they had heard from the Arapaho, and sang in corrupted form, with only a general idea of their
    meaning, but they now have a number of songs in their own language, some of which are singularly pleasing in melody
    and sentiment.</p>

  <h4 id="Wichita_Kichai_and_Delaware">THE WICHITA, KICHAI, AND DELAWARE</h4>

  <p>Closely associated with the Caddo on the same reservation are the Wichita, with their subtribes, the Tawakoni and
    Waco, numbering together 316 in 1893; the Delaware, numbering 94, and the Kichai (Keechies), numbering only 52. Of
    these, all but the Delaware, who are Algonquian, belong to the Caddoan stock. The Wichita and their subtribes,
    although retaining in indistinct form the common Caddoan tradition, claim as their proper home the Wichita
    mountains, near which they still remain. Sixty years ago their principal village was on the north side of the north
    fork of Red river, a short distance below the mouth of Elm creek, in Oklahoma. They live in conical grass houses
    and, like the other tribes of the stock, are agricultural. They call themselves <i>Kĭ′tikĭti′sh</i>—they are called
    <i>Tawe′hash</i> by the Caddo and Kichai—and are known to most of their other neighbors and in the sign language as
    the “Tattooed People” (<i>Do′kănă</i>, Comanche; <i>Do‛gu′at</i>, Kiowa), from an old custom now nearly obsolete.
    For the same reason and from their resemblance to the Pawnee, with whose language their own has a close connection,
    the French called them <i>Pani Pique′s</i>.</p>

  <p>The Kichai or Keechie, or <i>Ki′tsäsh</i>, as they call themselves, are a small tribe of the same stock, and claim
    to have moved up Red river in company with the Caddo. Their language is different from that of any of their
    neighbors, but approaches the Pawnee.</p>

  <p>The Delaware are a small band of the celebrated tribe of that name. They removed from the east and settled with the
    main body in Kansas, but drifted south into Texas while it was still Spanish territory. After a long series of
    conflicts with the American settlers of Texas, before and after the Mexican war, they were finally taken under the
    protection of the United States government and assigned to their present reservation along with other emigrant
    tribes from that state.</p>

  <p>This is another song composed by Nyu′taa, who herself explained it. In this trance vision she saw a spirit woman
    painted with blue stripes on her forehead and a crow on her chin, who told her that she was “her sister, the Evening
    Star.” While singing this song Nyu′taa was sitting near me, when she suddenly cried out and went into a spasm of
    trembling and crying lasting some minutes, lifting up her right hand toward the west at the same time. Such attacks
    were so common among the women at song rehearsals as frequently to interfere with the work, although the bystanders
    regarded them as a matter of course and took only a passing notice of these incidents.</p>

  <p>This refers to what the Caddo call the “return of the eagle feathers” in the Ghost dance. With the Caddo, as with
    other tribes, the eagle is a sacred bird, and in the old times only the few medicine-men who knew the sacred formula
    would dare to kill one for the feathers. Should anyone else kill an eagle, his family would die or some other great
    misfortune would come upon him. The formula consisted of certain secret prayers and ritual performances. Among the
    Cherokee the eagle killer’s prayer was a petition to the eagle not to be revenged upon the tribe, because it was not
    an Indian, but a Spaniard, who had killed him—an indication of the vivid remembrance in which the cruelty of the
    early Spaniards was held among the southern tribes. To further guard against the anger of the eagles, the Cherokee
    eagle killer, on his return to the village, announced that he had killed, not an eagle, but a snowbird, the latter
    being too small and insignificant to be dreaded. The eagle-killing ceremony among the northern prairie tribes has
    been already described under <a href="#Arapaho_47">Arapaho song 47</a>. The Caddo eagle killer always took with him a robe or some other
    valuable offering, and after shooting the eagle, making the prayer, and pulling out the tail and wing feathers he
    covered the body with the robe and left it there as a peace offering to the spirit of the eagle. The dead eagle was
    never brought home, as among the Cherokee. The last man of the Caddo who knew the eagle-killing ritual died some
    years ago, and since then they have had to go without eagle feathers or buy them from the Kiowa and other tribes.
    Since Sitting Bull came down and “gave the feather”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1101">1101</span> to the
    leaders of the dance the prohibition is removed, and men and women alike are now at liberty to get and wear eagle
    feathers as they will.</p>

  <p>From a letter of Judge James Wickersham, already quoted as an authority on the Shaker religion of the Columbia
    River tribes, it appears that Aiyal is not the same individual as Yowaluch, as was stated by our Yakima informants,
    who were doubtless deceived by the resemblance of sound. Judge Wickersham writes: “I know this man Aiyal, and he and
    Yowaluch, while great friends, are not the same person. Aiyal is a Cowlitz, and was sent by Yowaluch to the Yakima,
    together with John W. Simmons, to convert that tribe.”</p>

      enters into every important ceremonial performance of the Apache and Navaho. The latter always sprinkle some
      upon the surface of the water before crossing a stream. The name of the medicine-man is written also
      Nakay-doklunni or Nockay Delklinne, and he was commonly called Bobbydoklinny by the whites. Dr Washington
      Matthews, the best authority on the closely related dialect of the Navaho, thinks the name might mean “spotted
      or freckled Mexican,” <i>Nakai</i>, literally “white alien,” being the name for Mexican in both dialects. The
      name would not necessarily indicate that the medicine-man was of Mexican origin, but might have been given, in
      accordance with the custom of some tribes, to commemorate the fact that he had killed a freckled Mexican.

      Mount Idaho, in revenge for the murder of one of their tribe.” (Comr. Rept., 1877, page 12.)

      <p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>: Your letter of September 24 in regard to Jack Wilson, the ‘Messiah,’
        at hand and duly noted. In reply will say that his Indian name is Ko-wee-jow (‘Big belly’). I do not know as
        it will be possible to get a photo of him. I never saw him or a photo of him. He works among the whites about
        40 miles from my Walker Lake reserve, and never comes near the agency when I visit it. My headquarters are at
        Pyramid Lake, about 70 miles north of Walker. I am pursuing the course with him of nonattention or a silent
        ignoring. He seems to think, so I hear, that I will arrest him should he come within my reach. I would give
        him no such notoriety. He, like all other prophets, has but little honor in his own country. He has been
        visited by delegations from various and many Indian, tribes, which I think should be discouraged all that is
        possible. Don’t know what the ‘Smoholler’ religion, you speak of, is. He speaks English well, but is not
        educated. He got his doctrine in part from contact, living in and with a religious family. There are neither
        ghost songs, dances, nor ceremonials among them about my agencies. Would not be allowed. I think they died out
        with ‘Sitting Bull.’ This is the extent of the information I can give you.”</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p class="clear p2">Here is an agent who has under his special charge and within a few miles of his agency the man who has created
      the greatest religious ferment known to the Indians of this generation, a movement which had been engrossing the
      attention of the newspaper and magazine press for a year, yet he has never seen him; and while the Indian
      Office, from which he gets his commission, in a praiseworthy effort to get at an understanding of the matter, is
      sending circular letters broadcast to the western agencies, calling for all procurable information in regard to
      the messiah and his doctrines, he “pursues the course of nonattention.” He has never heard of the Smohalla
      religion of the adjacent northern tribes, although the subject is repeatedly mentioned in the volumes of the
      Indian Commissioner’s report from 1870 to 1879, which were, or should have been, on a shelf in the office in
      which the letter was written. He asserts that there are no ghost songs, dances, or ceremonies among his Indians,
      although these things were going on constantly and had been for at least three years, and only a short time
      before a large delegation from beyond the mountains had attended a Ghost dance near Walker lake which lasted
      four days and nights. Chapman in 1890, and the author in 1891, saw the cleared grounds with the willow frames
      where these dances were being held regularly at short intervals. I found the ghost songs familiar to all the
      Indians with whom I talked, and had no special trouble to find the messiah and obtain his picture. The peaceful
      character of the movement is sufficiently shown by the fact that while the eastern papers are teeming with
      rumors of uprising and massacre, and troops are being hurried to the front, the agent at the central point of
      the disturbance seems to be unaware that there is anything special going on around him and can “silently ignore”
      the whole matter.</p>

    <a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[7]</a> This battle, probably the most important conflict
      that ever occurred between the Paiute and the whites, was fought in April, 1860, near the present agency at
      Pyramid lake and about 8 miles from Wadsworth, Nevada. Some miners having seized and forcibly detained a couple
      of Indian women, their husbands raised a party and rescued them, without, however, inflicting any punishment on
      the guilty ones. This was considered an “Indian outrage” and a strong body of miners collected and marched
      toward Pyramid lake to wipe out the Indian camp. The Paiute, armed almost entirely with bows and arrows,
      surprised them in a narrow pass at the spot indicated, with the result that the whites were defeated and fled in
      disorder, leaving nearly fifty dead on the field. The whole affair in its causes and results was most
      discreditable to the whites.

    Say, shall not I at last attain
      Some height, from whence the Past is clear,
      In whose immortal atmosphere
    I shall behold my dead again?
                        _Bayard Taylor._

    For the fires grow cold and the dances fail,
      And the songs in their echoes die;
    And what have we left but the graves beneath,
      And, above, the waiting sky?
                        _The Song of the Ancient People._

    My Father, have pity on me!
    I have nothing to eat,
    I am dying of thirst—
    Everything is gone!
                        _Arapaho Ghost Song._

                       THE GHOST-DANCE RELIGION

                           By +James Mooney+

                             INTRODUCTION

In the fall of 1890 the author was preparing to go to Indian Territory,
under the auspices of the Bureau of Ethnology, to continue researches
among the Cherokee, when the Ghost dance began to attract attention,
and permission was asked and received to investigate that subject
also among the wilder tribes in the western part of the territory.
Proceeding directly to the Cheyenne and Arapaho, it soon became evident
that there was more in the Ghost dance than had been suspected, with
the result that the investigation, to which it had been intended to
devote only a few weeks, has extended over a period of more than
three years, and might be continued indefinitely, as the dance still
exists (in 1896) and is developing new features at every performance.
The uprising among the Sioux in the meantime made necessary also the
examination of a mass of documentary material in the files of the
Indian Office and the War Department bearing on the outbreak, in
addition to the study in the field of the strictly religious features
of the dance.

The first visit of about four months (December, 1890–April, 1891) was
made to the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Caddo, and
Wichita, all living near together in the western part of what was then
Indian Territory, but is now Oklahoma. These tribes were all more or
less under the influence of the new religion. The principal study
was made among the Arapaho, who were the most active propagators of
the “Messiah” doctrine among the southern tribes and are especially
friendly and cordial in disposition.

On returning to Washington, the author received a commission to make
an ethnologic collection for the World’s Columbian Exposition, and,
selecting the Kiowa for that purpose as a representative prairie
tribe, started out again almost immediately to the same field. This
trip, lasting three months, gave further opportunity for study of the
Ghost dance among the same tribes. After returning and attending to
the labeling and arranging of the collection, a study was made of all
documents bearing on the subject in possession of the Indian Office
and the War Department. Another trip was then made to the field for
the purpose of investigating the dance among the Sioux, where it had
attracted most attention, and among the Paiute, where it originated.
On this journey the author visited the Omaha, Winnebago, Sioux of Pine
Ridge, Paiute, Cheyenne, and Arapaho; met and talked with the messiah
himself, and afterward, on the strength of this fact, obtained from the
Cheyenne the original letter containing his message and instructions to
the southern tribes. This trip occupied about three months.

A few months later, in the summer of 1892, another journey was made
to the West, in the course of which the southern tribes and the Sioux
were revisited, and some time was spent in Wyoming with the Shoshoni
and northern Arapaho, the latter of whom were perhaps the most earnest
followers of the messiah in the north. This trip consumed four months.
After some time spent in Washington in elaborating notes already
obtained, a winter trip (1892–93) was made under another commission
from the World’s Fair to the Navaho and the Hopi or Moki, of New Mexico
and Arizona. Although these tribes were not directly concerned in the
Ghost dance, they had been visited by apostles of the new doctrine, and
were able to give some account of the ceremony as it existed among the
Havasupai or Cohonino and others farther to the west. On the return
journey another short stay was made among the Kiowa and Arapaho. In
the summer of 1893 a final visit, covering a period of five months,
was made to the western tribes of Oklahoma, bringing the personal
observation and study of the Ghost dance down to the beginning of 1894.

The field investigation therefore occupied twenty-two months, involving
nearly 32,000 miles of travel and more or less time spent with about
twenty tribes. To obtain exact knowledge of the ceremony, the author
took part in the dance among the Arapaho and Cheyenne. He also carried
a kodak and a tripod camera, with which he made photographs of the
dance and the trance both without and within the circle. Several months
were spent in consulting manuscript documents and printed sources
of information in the departments and libraries at Washington, and
correspondence was carried on with persons in various parts of the
country who might be able to give additional facts. From the beginning
every effort was made to get a correct statement of the subject. Beyond
this, the work must speak for itself.

As the Ghost dance doctrine is only the latest of a series of Indian
religious revivals, and as the idea on which it is founded is a
hope common to all humanity, considerable space has been given to a
discussion of the primitive messiah belief and of the teachings of the
various Indian prophets who have preceded Wovoka, together with brief
sketches of several Indian wars belonging to the same periods.

In the songs the effort has been to give the spirit and exact
rendering, without going into analytic details. The main purpose of the
work is not linguistic, and as nearly every tribe concerned speaks a
different language from all the others, any close linguistic study must
be left to the philologist who can afford to devote a year or more to
an individual tribe. The only one of these tribes of which the author
claims intimate knowledge is the Kiowa.

                             THE NARRATIVE

                              +Chapter I+

                             PARADISE LOST

    There are hours long departed which memory brings
    Like blossoms of Eden to twine round the heart.
                                                  _Moore._


The wise men tell us that the world is growing happier—that we live
longer than did our fathers, have more of comfort and less of toil,
fewer wars and discords, and higher hopes and aspirations. So say the
wise men; but deep in our own hearts we know they are wrong. For were
not we, too, born in Arcadia, and have we not—each one of us—in that
May of life when the world was young, started out lightly and airily
along the path that led through green meadows to the blue mountains
on the distant horizon, beyond which lay the great world we were to
conquer? And though others dropped behind, have we not gone on through
morning brightness and noonday heat, with eyes always steadily forward,
until the fresh grass began to be parched and withered, and the way
grew hard and stony, and the blue mountains resolved into gray rocks
and thorny cliffs? And when at last we reached the toilsome summits, we
found the glory that had lured us onward was only the sunset glow that
fades into darkness while we look, and leaves us at the very goal to
sink down, tired in body and sick at heart, with strength and courage
gone, to close our eyes and dream again, not of the fame and fortune
that were to be ours, but only of the old-time happiness that we have
left so far behind.

As with men, so is it with nations. The lost paradise is the world’s
dreamland of youth. What tribe or people has not had its golden age,
before Pandora’s box was loosed, when women were nymphs and dryads and
men were gods and heroes? And when the race lies crushed and groaning
beneath an alien yoke, how natural is the dream of a redeemer, an
Arthur, who shall return from exile or awake from some long sleep to
drive out the usurper and win back for his people what they have lost.
The hope becomes a faith and the faith becomes the creed of priests and
prophets, until the hero is a god and the dream a religion, looking to
some great miracle of nature for its culmination and accomplishment.
The doctrines of the Hindu avatar, the Hebrew Messiah, the Christian
millennium, and the Hesûnanin of the Indian Ghost dance are essentially
the same, and have their origin in a hope and longing common to all
humanity.

Probably every Indian tribe, north and south, had its early hero god,
the great doer or teacher of all first things, from the Inskeha and
Manabozho of the rude Iroquoian and Algonquian to the Quetzalcoatl, the
Bochica, and the Viracocha of the more cultivated Aztecs, Muyscas, and
Quichuas of the milder southland. Among the roving tribes of the north
this hero is hardly more than an expert magician, frequently degraded
to the level of a common trickster, who, after ridding the world of
giants and monsters, and teaching his people a few simple arts, retires
to the upper world to rest and smoke until some urgent necessity again
requires his presence below. Under softer southern skies the myth takes
more poetic form and the hero becomes a person of dignified presence, a
father and teacher of his children, a very Christ, worthy of all love
and reverence, who gathers together the wandering nomads and leads them
to their destined country, where he instructs them in agriculture,
house building, and the art of government, regulates authority, and
inculcates peaceful modes of life. “Under him, the earth teemed with
fruits and flowers without the pains of culture. An ear of Indian corn
was as much as a single man could carry. The cotton, as it grew, took
of its own accord the rich dyes of human art. The air was filled with
intoxicating perfumes and the sweet melody of birds. In short, these
were the halcyon days, which find a place in the mythic systems of
so many nations in the Old World. It was the golden age of Anahuac.”
(_Prescott, 1._)[1] When at last his work is well accomplished, he bids
farewell to his sorrowing subjects, whom he consoles with the sacred
promise that he will one day return and resume his kingdom, steps into
his magic boat by the seashore, and sails away out of their sight to
the distant land of sunrise.

Such was Quetzalcoatl of the Aztecs, and such in all essential respects
was the culture god of the more southern semicivilized races. Curiously
enough, this god, at once a Moses and a messiah, is usually described
as a white man with flowing beard. From this and other circumstances
it has been argued that the whole story is only another form of the
dawn myth, but whether the Indian god be an ancient deified lawgiver of
their own race, or some nameless missionary who found his way across
the trackless ocean in the early ages of Christianity, or whether we
have here only a veiled parable of the morning light bringing life
and joy to the world and then vanishing to return again from the east
with the dawn, it is sufficient to our purpose that the belief in the
coming of a messiah, who should restore them to their original happy
condition, was well nigh universal among the American tribes.

This faith in the return of a white deliverer from the east opened the
gate to the Spaniards at their first coming alike in Haiti, Mexico,
Yucatan, and Peru. (_Brinton, 1._) The simple native welcomed the white
strangers as the children or kindred of their long-lost benefactor,
immortal beings whose near advent had been foretold by oracles and
omens, whose faces borrowed from the brightness of the dawn, whose
glistening armor seemed woven from the rays of sunlight, and whose
god-like weapons were the lightning and the thunderbolt. Their first
overbearing demands awakened no resentment; for may not the gods claim
their own, and is not resistance to the divine will a crime? Not until
their most sacred things were trampled under foot, and the streets
of the holy city itself ran red with the blood of their slaughtered
princes, did they read aright the awful prophecy by the light of
their blazing temples, and know that instead of the children of an
incarnate god they had welcomed a horde of incarnate devils. “The light
of civilization would be poured on their land. But it would be the
light of a consuming fire, before which their barbaric glory, their
institutions, their very existence and name as a nation, would wither
and become extinct. Their doom was sealed when the white man had set
his foot on their soil.” (_Prescott, 2._)

The great revolt of the Pueblo Indians in August, 1680, was one of the
first determined efforts made by the natives on the northern continent
to throw off the yoke of a foreign oppressor. The Pueblo tribes along
the Rio Grande and farther to the west, a gentle, peaceful race, had
early welcomed the coming of the Spaniards, with their soldiers and
priests, as friends who would protect them against the wild marauding
tribes about them and teach them the mysteries of a greater “medicine”
than belonged to their own kachinas. The hope soon faded into bitter
disappointment. The soldiers, while rough and overbearing toward
their brown-skin allies, were yet unable to protect them from the
inroads of their enemies. The priests prohibited their dances and
simple amusements, yet all their ringing of bells and chanting of
hymns availed not to bring more rain on the crops or to turn aside the
vengeful Apache. “What have we gained by all this?” said the Pueblos
one to another; “not peace and not happiness, for these new rulers will
not protect us from our enemies, and take from us all the enjoyments we
once knew.”

The pear was ripe. Popé, a medicine-man of the Tewa, had come back
from a pilgrimage to the far north, where he claimed to have visited
the magic lagoon of Shipapu, whence his people traced their origin and
to which the souls of their dead returned after leaving this life. By
these ancestral spirits he had been endowed with occult powers and
commanded to go back and rouse the Pueblos to concerted effort for
deliverance from the foreign yoke of the strangers.

Wonderful beings were these spirit messengers. Swift as light and
impalpable as thought, they passed under the earth from the magic lake
to the secret subterranean chamber of the oracle and stood before him
as shapes of fire, and spoke, telling him to prepare the strings of
yucca knots and send them with the message to all the Pueblos far and
near, so that in every village the chiefs might untie one knot from the
string each day, and know when they came to the last knot that then was
the time to strike.

From the Pecos, across the Rio Grande to Zuñi and the far-distant Hopi
mesas, every Pueblo village accepted the yucca string and began secret
preparation for the rising. The time chosen was the new moon of August,
1680, but, through a partial discovery of the plot, the explosion was
precipitated on the 10th. So sudden and complete was the surprise that
many Spaniards in the Pueblo country, priests, soldiers, and civilians,
were killed, and the survivors, after holding out for a time under
Governor Otermin at Santa Fé, fled to El Paso, and in October there
remained not a single Spaniard in all New Mexico. (_Bandelier, 1a, 1b._)

Despite their bitter disappointment, the southern nations continued to
cherish the hope of a coming redeemer, who now assumed the character
of a terrible avenger of their wrongs, and the white-skin conqueror
has had bloody occasion to remember that his silent peon, as he toils
by blue Chapala or sits amid the ruins of his former grandeur in the
dark forests of Yucatan, yet waits ever and always the coming of the
day which shall break the power of the alien Spaniard and restore to
their inheritance the children of Anahuac and Mayapan. In Peru the
natives refused to believe that the last of the Incas had perished a
wanderer in the forests of the eastern Cordilleras. For more than two
centuries they cherished the tradition that he had only retired to
another kingdom beyond the mountains, from which he would return in
his own good time to sweep their haughty oppressors from the land. In
1781 the slumbering hope found expression in a terrible insurrection
under the leadership of the mestizo Condorcanqui, a descendant of the
ancient royal family, who boldly proclaimed himself the long lost
Tupac Amaru, child of the sun and Inca of Peru. With mad enthusiasm
the Quichua highlanders hailed him as their destined deliverer and
rightful sovereign, and binding around his forehead the imperial fillet
of the Incas, he advanced at the head of an immense army to the walls
of Cuzco, declaring his purpose to blot out the very memory of the
white man and reestablish the Indian empire in the City of the Sun.
Inspired by the hope of vengeance on the conqueror, even boys became
leaders of their people, and it was only after a bloody struggle of two
years’ duration that the Spaniards were able to regain the mastery and
consigned the captive Inca, with all his family, to an ignominious and
barbarous death. Even then so great was the feeling of veneration which
he had inspired in the breasts of the Indians that “notwithstanding
their fear of the Spaniards, and though they were surrounded by
soldiers of the victorious army, they prostrated themselves at the
sight of the last of the children of the sun, as he passed along the
streets to the place of execution.” (_Humboldt, 1._)

In the New World, as in the Old, the advent of the deliverer was to
be heralded by signs and wonders. Thus in Mexico, a mysterious rising
of the waters of Lake Tezcuco, three comets blazing in the sky, and a
strange light in the east, prepared the minds of the people for the
near coming of the Spaniards. (_Prescott, 3._) In this connection,
also, there was usually a belief in a series of previous destructions
by flood, fire, famine, or pestilence, followed by a regeneration,
through, the omnipotent might of the savior. The doctrine that the
world is old and worn out, and that the time for its renewal is near
at hand, is an essential part of the teaching of the Ghost dance.
The number of these cycles of destruction was variously stated among
different tribes, but perhaps the most sadly prophetic form of the
myth was found among the Winnebago, who forty years ago held that the
tenth generation of their people was near its close, and that at the
end of the thirteenth the red race would be destroyed. By prayers and
ceremonies they were then endeavoring to placate their angry gods and
put farther away the doom that now seems rapidly closing in on them.

                             +Chapter II+

                   THE DELAWARE PROPHET AND PONTIAC

  Hear what the Great Spirit has ordered me to tell you: Put off
  entirely the customs which you have adopted since the white people
  came among us.—_The Delaware Prophet._

  This is our land, and not yours.—_The Confederate Tribes, 1752._


The English advances were slow and halting, for a long period almost
imperceptible, while the establishment of a few small garrisons and
isolated trading stations by the French hardly deserved to be called an
occupancy of the country. As a consequence, the warlike northern tribes
were slow to realize that an empire was slipping from their grasp,
and it was not until the two great nations prepared for the final
struggle in the New World that the native proprietors began to read
the stars aright. Then it was, in 1752, that the Lenape chiefs sent to
the British agent the pointed interrogatory: “The English claim all on
one side of the river, the French claim all on the other—where is the
land of the Indians?” (_Bancroft, 1._) Then, as they saw the French
strengthening themselves along the lakes, there came a stronger protest
from the council ground of the confederate tribes of the west: “This is
our land and not yours. Fathers, both you and the English are white;
the land belongs to neither the one nor the other of you, but the Great
Being above allotted it to be a dwelling place for us; so, fathers, I
desire you to withdraw, as I have desired our brothers, the English.”
A wampum belt gave weight to the words. (_Bancroft, 2._) The French
commander’s reply was blunt, but more practiced diplomats assured
the red men that all belonged to the Indian, and that the great king
of the French desired only to set up a boundary against the further
encroachments of the English, who would otherwise sweep the red tribes
from the Ohio as they had already driven them from the Atlantic. The
argument was plausible. In every tribe were French missionaries, whose
fearless courage and devotion had won the admiration and love of the
savage; in every village was domiciliated a hardy voyageur, with his
Indian wife and family of children, in whose veins commingled the blood
of the two races and whose ears were attuned alike to the wild songs of
the forest and the rondeaus of Normandy or Provence. It was no common
tie that bound together the Indians and the French, and when a governor
of Canada and the general of his army stepped into the circle of braves
to dance the war dance and sing the war song with their red allies,
thirty-three wild tribes declared on the wampum belt, “The French are
our brothers and their king is our father. We will try his hatchet
upon the English” (_Bancroft, 3_), and through seven years of blood
and death the lily and the totem were borne abreast until the flag of
France went down forever on the heights of Quebec.

For some time after the surrender the unrest of the native tribes was
soothed into a semblance of quiet by the belief, artfully inculcated
by their old allies, that the king of France, wearied by his great
exertions, had fallen asleep for a little while, but would soon awake
to take vengeance on the English for the wrongs they had inflicted on
his red children. Then, as they saw English garrisons occupying the
abandoned posts and English traders passing up the lakes even to the
sacred island of the Great Turtle, the despairing warriors said to one
another, “We have been deceived. English and French alike are white men
and liars. We must turn from both and seek help from our Indian gods.”

In 1762 a prophet appeared among the Delawares, at Tuscarawas, on the
Muskingum, who preached a union of all the red tribes and a return
to the old Indian life, which he declared to be the divine command,
as revealed to himself in a wonderful vision. From an old French
manuscript, written by an anonymous eyewitness of the scene which he
describes, we have the details of this vision, as related by Pontiac
to his savage auditors at the great council of the tribes held near
Detroit in April, 1763. Parkman gives the story on the authority of
this manuscript, which he refers to as the “Pontiac manuscript,” and
states that it was long preserved in a Canadian family at Detroit,
and afterward deposited with the Historical Society of Michigan. It
bears internal evidence of genuineness, and is supposed to have been
written by a French priest. (_Parkman, 1._) The vision, from the same
manuscript, is related at length in Schoolcraft’s Algic Researches.

According to the prophet’s story, being anxious to know the “Master
of Life,” he determined, without mentioning his desire to anyone, to
undertake a journey to the spirit world. Ignorant of the way, and
not knowing any person who, having been there, could direct him, he
performed a mystic rite in the hope of receiving some light as to the
course he should pursue. He then fell into a deep sleep, in which he
dreamed that it was only necessary to begin his journey and that by
continuing to walk forward he would at last arrive at his destination.

Early the next morning, taking his gun, ammunition, and kettle,
he started off, firmly convinced that by pressing onward without
discouragement he should accomplish his object. Day after day he
proceeded without incident, until at sunset of the eighth day, while
preparing to encamp for the night by the side of a small stream in a
little opening in the forest, he noticed, running out from the edge of
the prairie, three wide and well-trodden paths. Wondering somewhat that
they should be there, he finished his temporary lodging and, lighting
a fire, began to prepare his supper. While thus engaged, he observed
with astonishment that the paths became more distinct as the night grew
darker. Alarmed at the strange appearance, he was about to abandon his
encampment and seek another at a safer distance, when he remembered
his dream and the purpose of his journey. It seemed to him that one of
these roads must lead to the place of which he was in search, and he
determined, therefore, to remain where he was until morning, and then
take one of the three and follow it to the end. Accordingly, the next
morning, after a hasty meal, he left his encampment, and, burning with
the ardor of discovery, took the widest path, which he followed until
noon, when he suddenly saw a large fire issuing apparently from the
earth. His curiosity being aroused, he went toward it, but the fire
increased to such a degree that he became frightened and turned back.

He now took the next widest of the three paths, which he followed
as before until noon, when a similar fire again drove him back and
compelled him to take the third road, which he kept a whole day
without meeting anything unusual, when suddenly he saw a precipitous
mountain of dazzling brightness directly in his path. Recovering from
his wonder, he drew near and examined it, but could see no sign of a
road to the summit. He was about to give way to disappointment, when,
looking up, he saw seated a short distance up the mountain a woman of
bright beauty and clad in snow-white garments, who addressed him in his
own language, telling him that on the summit of the mountain was the
abode of the Master of Life, whom he had journeyed so far to meet. “But
to reach it,” said she, “you must leave all your cumbersome dress and
equipments at the foot, then go and wash in the river which I show you,
and afterward ascend the mountain.”

He obeyed her instructions, and on asking how he could hope to climb
the mountain, which, was steep and slippery as glass, she replied that
in order to mount he must use only his left hand and foot. This seemed
to him almost impossible, but, encouraged by the woman, he began to
climb, and at length, after much difficulty, reached the top. Here the
woman suddenly vanished, and he found himself alone without a guide. On
looking about, he saw before him a plain, in the midst of which were
three villages, with well-built houses disposed in orderly arrangement.
He bent his steps toward the principal one, but after going a short
distance he remembered that he was naked, and was about to turn back
when a voice told him that as he had washed himself in the river he
might go on without fear. Thus bidden, he advanced without hesitation
to the gate of the village, where he was admitted and saw approaching
a handsome man in white garments, who offered to lead him into the
presence of the Master of Life. Admiring the beauty of everything about
him, he was then conducted to the Master of Life, who took him by
the hand and gave him for a seat a hat bordered with gold. Afraid of
spoiling the hat, he hesitated to sit down until again told to do so,
when he obeyed, and the Master of Life thus addressed him:

  I am the Master of Life, whom you wish to see and with whom you
  wish to speak. Listen to what I shall tell you for yourself and for
  all the Indians.

He then commanded him to exhort his people to cease from drunkenness,
wars, polygamy, and the medicine song, and continued:

  The land on which you are, I have made for you, not for others.
  Wherefore do you suffer the whites to dwell upon your lands? Can
  you not do without them? I know that those whom you call the
  children of your Great Father [the King of France] supply your
  wants; but were you not wicked as you are you would not need them.
  You might live as you did before you knew them. Before those whom
  you call your brothers [the French] had arrived, did not your bow
  and arrow maintain you? You needed neither gun, powder, nor any
  other object. The flesh of animals was your food; their skins
  your raiment. But when I saw you inclined to evil, I removed the
  animals into the depths of the forest that you might depend on your
  brothers for your necessaries, for your clothing. Again become good
  and do my will and I will send animals for your sustenance. I do
  not, however, forbid suffering among you your Father’s children. I
  love them; they know me; they pray to me. I supply their own wants,
  and give them that which they bring to you. Not so with those who
  are come to trouble your possessions [the English]. Drive them
  away; wage war against them; I love them not; they know me not;
  they are my enemies; they are your brothers’ enemies. Send them
  back to the lands I have made for them. Let them remain there.
  (_Schoolcraft, Alg. Res., 1._)

The Master of Life then gave him a prayer, carved in Indian
hieroglyphics upon a wooden stick, which he was told to deliver to his
chief on returning to earth. (_Parkman, 2._) His instructor continued:

  Learn it by heart, and teach it to all the Indians and children. It
  must be repeated morning and evening. Do all that I have told thee,
  and announce it to all the Indians as coming from the Master of
  Life. Let them drink but one draught, or two at most, in one day.
  Let them have but one wife, and discontinue running after other
  people’s wives and daughters. Let them not fight one another. Let
  them not sing the medicine song, for in singing the medicine song
  they speak to the evil spirit. Drive from your lands those dogs
  in red clothing; they are only an injury to you. When you want
  anything, apply to me, as your brothers do, and I will give to
  both. Do not sell to your brothers that which I have placed on the
  earth as food. In short, become good, and you shall want nothing.
  When you meet one another, bow and give one another the [left]
  hand of the heart. Above all, I command thee to repeat morning and
  evening the prayer which I have given thee.

The Indian received the prayer, promising to do as he had been
commanded and to recommend the same course to others. His former
conductor then came and, leading him to the foot of the mountain, bid
him resume his garments and go back to his village. His return excited
much surprise among his friends, who had supposed him lost. They asked
him where he had been, but as he had been commanded to speak to no one
until he had seen the chief, he motioned with his hand to signify that
he had come from above. On entering the village he went at once to the
wigwam of the chief, to whom he delivered the prayer and the message
which he had received from the Master of Life. (_Schoolcraft, Alg.
Res., 2._)

Although the story as here given bears plain impress of the white
man’s ideas, it is essentially aboriginal. While the discrimination
expressed by the Master of Life in favor of the French and against
the English may have been due to the fact that the author of the
manuscript was a Frenchman, it is more probable that we have here set
forth only the well-known preference of the wild tribes. The occupancy
of a region by the English always meant the speedy expulsion of the
natives. The French, on the contrary, lived side by side with the red
men, joining in their dances and simple amusements, and entering with
fullest sympathy into their wild life, so that they were regarded
rather as brethren of an allied tribe than as intruders of an alien
race. This feeling is well indicated in the prophet’s narrative,
where the Indians, while urged to discard everything that they have
adopted from the whites, are yet to allow the French to remain among
them, though exhorted to relentless war on the English. The difference
received tragic exemplification at Michilimackinac a year later, when
a handful of French traders looked on unarmed and unhurt while a
crew of maddened savages were butchering, scalping, and drinking the
blood of British soldiers. The introduction of the trivial incident
of the hat is characteristically Indian, and the confounding of
dreams and visions with actual happenings is a frequent result of
mental exaltation of common occurrence in the history of religious
enthusiasts. The Delaware prophet regards the whole experience as an
actual fact instead of a distempered vision induced by long fasts and
vigils, and the hieroglyphic prayer—undoubtedly graven by himself while
under the ecstasy—is to him a real gift from heaven. The whole story
is a striking parallel of the miraculous experiences recounted by the
modern apostles of the Ghost dance. The prayer-stick also and the
heavenly map, later described and illustrated, reappear in the account
of Känakûk, the Kickapoo prophet, seventy years afterward, showing in a
striking manner the continuity of aboriginal ideas and methods.

The celebrated missionary, Heckewelder, who spent fifty years among
the Delawares, was personally acquainted with this prophet and gives a
detailed account of his teachings and of his symbolic parchments. He
says:

  In the year 1762 there was a famous preacher of the Delaware
  nation, who resided at Cayahaga, near Lake Erie, and travelled
  about the country, among the Indians, endeavouring to persuade them
  that he had been appointed by the Great Spirit to instruct them in
  those things that were agreeable to him, and point out to them the
  offences by which they had drawn his displeasure on themselves, and
  the means by which they might recover his favour for the future.
  He had drawn, as he pretended, by the direction of the Great
  Spirit, a kind of map on a piece of deerskin, somewhat dressed like
  parchment, which he called “the great Book or Writing.” This, he
  said, he had been ordered to shew to the Indians, that they might
  see the situation in which the Mannitto had originally placed them,
  the misery which they had brought upon themselves by neglecting
  their duty, and the only way that was now left them to regain
  what they had lost. This map he held before him while preaching,
  frequently pointing to particular marks and spots upon it, and
  giving explanations as he went along.

  The size of this map was about fifteen inches square, or, perhaps,
  something more. An inside square was formed by lines drawn within
  it, of about eight inches each way; two of these lines, however,
  were not closed by about half an inch at the corners. Across these
  inside lines, others of about an inch in length were drawn with
  sundry other lines and marks, all which was intended to represent
  a strong inaccessible barrier, to prevent those without from
  entering the space within, otherwise than at the place appointed
  for that purpose. When the map was held as he directed, the corners
  which were not closed lay at the left-hand side, directly opposite
  to each other, the one being at the southeast by south, and the
  nearest at the northeast by north. In explaining or describing the
  particular points on this map, with his fingers always pointing to
  the place he was describing, he called the space within the inside
  lines “the heavenly regions,” or the place destined by the Great
  Spirit for the habitation of the Indians in future life. The space
  left open at the southeast corner he called the “avenue,” which had
  been intended for the Indians to enter into this heaven, but which
  was now in the possession of the white people; wherefore the Great
  Spirit had since caused another “avenue” to be made on the opposite
  side, at which, however, it was both difficult and dangerous for
  them to enter, there being many impediments in their way, besides a
  large ditch leading to a gulf below, over which they had to leap;
  but the evil spirit kept at this very spot a continual watch for
  Indians, and whoever he laid hold of never could get away from him
  again, but was carried to his regions, where there was nothing but
  extreme poverty; where the ground was parched up by the heat for
  want of rain, no fruit came to perfection, the game was almost
  starved for want of pasture, and where the evil spirit, at his
  pleasure, transformed men into horses and dogs, to be ridden by him
  and follow him in his hunts and wherever he went.

  The space on the outside of this interior square was intended to
  represent the country given to the Indians to hunt, fish, and
  dwell in while in this world; the east side of it was called the
  ocean or “great salt-water lake.” Then the preacher, drawing the
  attention of his hearers particularly to the southeast avenue,
  would say to them, “Look here! See what we have lost by neglect and
  disobedience; by being remiss in the expression of our gratitude to
  the Great Spirit for what he has bestowed upon us; by neglecting
  to make to him sufficient sacrifices; by looking upon a people
  of a different colour from our own, who had come across a great
  lake, as if they were a part of ourselves; by suffering them to
  sit down by our side, and looking at them with indifference, while
  they were not only taking our country from us, but this (pointing
  to the spot), this, our own avenue, leading into those beautiful
  regions which were destined for us. Such is the sad condition to
  which we are reduced. What is now to be done, and what remedy is
  to be applied? I will tell you, my friends. Hear what the Great
  Spirit has ordered me to tell you! You are to make sacrifices, in
  the manner that I shall direct; to put off entirely from yourselves
  the customs which you have adopted since the white people came
  among us. You are to return to that former happy state, in which we
  lived in peace and plenty, before these strangers came to disturb
  us; and, above all, you must abstain from drinking their deadly
  _beson_, which they have forced upon us, for the sake of increasing
  their gains and diminishing our numbers. Then will the Great Spirit
  give success to our arms; then he will give us strength to conquer
  our enemies, to drive them from hence, and recover the passage to
  the heavenly regions which they have taken from us.”

  Such was in general the substance of his discourses. After having
  dilated more or less on the various topics which I have mentioned,
  he commonly concluded in this manner: “And now, my friends, in
  order that what I have told you may remain firmly impressed on your
  minds, and to refresh your memories from time to time, I advise
  you to preserve, in every family at least, such a book or writing
  as this, which I will finish off for you, provided you bring me
  the price, which is only one buckskin or two doeskins apiece.” The
  price was of course bought (_sic_), and the book purchased. In some
  of those maps, the figure of a deer or turkey, or both, was placed
  in the heavenly regions, and also in the dreary region of the evil
  spirit. The former, however, appeared fat and plump, while the
  latter seemed to have nothing but skin and bones. (_Heckewelder,
  1._)

From the narrative of John McCullough, who had been taken by the
Indians when a child of 8 years, and lived for some years as an
adopted son in a Delaware family in northeastern Ohio, we gather some
additional particulars concerning this prophet, whose name seems
to be lost to history. McCullough himself, who was then but a boy,
never met the prophet, but obtained his information from others who
had, especially from his Indian brother, who went to Tuscarawas (or
Tuscalaways) to see and hear the new apostle on his first appearance.

  It was said by those who went to see him that he had certain
  hieroglyphics marked on a piece of parchment, denoting the
  probation that human beings were subjected to whilst they were
  living on earth, and also denoting something of a future state.
  They informed me that he was almost constantly crying whilst he
  was exhorting them. I saw a copy of his hieroglyphics, as numbers
  of them had got them copied and undertook to preach or instruct
  others. The first or principal doctrine they taught them was to
  purify themselves from sin, which they taught they could do by
  the use of emetics and abstinence from carnal knowledge of the
  different sexes; to quit the use of firearms, and to live entirely
  in the original state that they were in before the white people
  found out their country. Nay, they taught that that fire was not
  pure that was made by steel and flint, but that they should make it
  by rubbing two sticks together.... It was said that their prophet
  taught them, or made them believe, that he had his instructions
  immediately from _Keesh-she-la-mil-lang-up_, or a being that
  _thought_ us into being, and that by following his instructions
  they would, in a few years, be able to drive the white people out
  of their country.

  I knew a company of them who had secluded themselves for the
  purpose of purifying from sin, as they thought they could do. I
  believe they made no use of firearms. They had been out more than
  two years before I left them.... It was said that they made use of
  no other weapons than their bows and arrows. They also taught, in
  shaking hands, to give the left hand in token of friendship, as it
  denoted that they gave the heart along with the hand. (_Pritts, 1._)

The religious ferment produced by the exhortations of the Delaware
prophet spread rapidly from tribe to tribe, until, under the guidance
of the master mind of the celebrated chief, Pontiac, it took shape in a
grand confederacy of all the northwestern tribes to oppose the further
progress of the English. The coast lands were lost to the Indians.
The Ohio and the lakes were still theirs, and the Alleghanies marked
a natural boundary between the two sections. Behind this mountain
barrier Pontiac determined to make his stand. Though the prospect of a
restoration of the French power might enable him to rally a following,
he himself knew he could expect no aid from the French, for their
armies had been defeated and their garrisons were already withdrawn;
but, relying on the patriotism of his own red warriors, when told that
the English were on their way to take possession of the abandoned
posts, he sent back the haughty challenge, “I stand in the path.”

To Pontiac must be ascribed the highest position among the leaders of
the Algonquian race. Born the son of a chief, he became in turn the
chief of his own people, the Ottawa, whom it is said he commanded on
the occasion of Braddock’s defeat. For this or other services in behalf
of the French he had received marks of distinguished consideration
from Montcalm himself. By reason of his natural ability, his influence
was felt and respected wherever the name of his tribe was spoken,
while to his dignity as chief he added the sacred character of high
priest of the powerful secret order of the Midé. (_Parkman, 3._) Now,
in the prime of manhood, he originated and formulated the policy of
a confederation of all the tribes, an idea afterward taken up and
carried almost to a successful accomplishment by the great Tecumtha.
As principal chief of the lake tribes, he summoned them to the great
council near Detroit, in April, 1763, and, as high priest and keeper
of the faith, he there announced to them the will of the Master of
Life, as revealed to the Delaware prophet, and called on them to unite
for the recovery of their ancient territories and the preservation of
their national life. Under the spell of his burning words the chiefs
listened as to an oracle, and cried out that he had only to declare
his will to be obeyed. (_Parkman, 4._) His project being unanimously
approved, runners were sent out to secure the cooperation of the more
remote nations, and in a short time the confederation embraced every
important tribe of Algonquian lineage, together with the Wyandot,
Seneca, Winnebago, and some of those to the southward. (_Parkman, 5._)

Only the genius of a Pontiac could have molded into a working unit
such an aggregation of diverse elements of savagery. His executive
ability is sufficiently proven by his creation of a regular commissary
department based on promissory notes—hieroglyphics graven on birchbark
and signed with the otter, the totem of his tribe; his diplomatic bent
appeared in his employment of two secretaries to attend to this unique
correspondence, each of whom he managed to keep in ignorance of the
business transacted by the other (_Parkman, 6_); while his military
capacity was soon to be evinced in the carefully laid plan which
enabled his warriors to strike simultaneously a crushing blow at every
British post scattered throughout the 500 miles of wilderness from
Pittsburg to the straits of Mackinaw.

The history of this war, so eloquently told by Parkman, reads like some
old knightly romance. The warning of the Indian girl; the concerted
attack on the garrisons; the ball play at Mackinac on the king’s
birthday, and the massacre that followed; the siege of Fort Pitt and
the heroic defense of Detroit; the bloody battle of Bushy run, where
the painted savage recoiled before the kilted Highlander, as brave and
almost as wild; Bouquet’s march into the forests of the Ohio, and the
submission of the vanquished tribes—all these things must be passed
over here. They have already been told by a master of language. But the
contest of savagery against civilization has but one ending, and the
scene closes with the death of Pontiac, a broken-spirited wanderer, cut
down at last by a hired assassin of his own race, for whose crime the
blood of whole tribes was poured out in atonement. (_Parkman, 7._)

                       EXPLANATION OF FIGURE 56

  The first portrait is taken from one given in Lossing’s American
  Revolution and War of 1812, +III+ (1875), page 189, and thus
  described: “The portrait of the Prophet is from a pencil sketch
  made by Pierre Le Dru, a young French trader, at Vincennes, in
  1808. He made a sketch of Tecumtha at about the same time, both of
  which I found in possession of his son at Quebec in 1848, and by
  whom I was kindly permitted to copy them.” The other is a copy of
  the picture painted by Catlin in 1881, after the tribe had removed
  to Kansas. The artist describes him as blind in his left (?) eye,
  and painted him holding his medicine fire in his right hand and his
  sacred string of beans in the other.

Forty years had passed away and changes had come to the western
territory. The cross of Saint George, erected in the place of the
lilies of France, had been supplanted by the flag of the young
republic, which in one generation had extended its sway from the lakes
to the gulf and from the Atlantic to the Rocky mountains. By treaties
made in 1768 with the Iroquois and Cherokee, the two leading Indian
confederacies in the east, the Ohio and the Kanawha had been fixed as
the boundary between the two races, the Indians renouncing forever
their claims to the seaboard, the Delaware, and the Susquehanna,
while they were confirmed in their possession of the Alleghany, the
Ohio, and the great northwest. But the restless borderer would not be
limited, and encroachments on the native domain were constantly being
made, resulting in a chronic warfare which kept alive the spirit of
resentment. The consequence was that in the final struggle of the
Revolution the Indian tribes ranged themselves on the British side.
When the war ended and a treaty of peace was made between the new
government and the old, no provision was made for the red allies of the
king, and they were left to continue the struggle single-handed. The
Indians claimed the Ohio country as theirs by virtue of the most solemn
treaties, but pioneers had already occupied western Pennsylvania,
western Virginia, and Kentucky, and were listening with eager attention
to the reports brought back by adventurous hunters from the fertile
lands of the Muskingum and the Scioto. They refused to be bound by the
treaties of a government they had repudiated, and the tribes of the
northwest were obliged to fight to defend their territories. Under the
able leadership of Little Turtle they twice rolled back the tide of
white invasion, defeating two of the finest armies ever sent into the
western country, until, worn out by twenty years of unceasing warfare,
and crushed and broken by the decisive victory of Wayne at the Fallen
Timbers, their villages in ashes and their cornfields cut down, the
dispirited chiefs met their conqueror at Greenville in 1795 and signed
away the rights for which they had so long contended.

[Illustration: +Fig. 57+—Greenville treaty medal, obverse and reverse.]

By this treaty, which marks the beginning of the end with the eastern
tribes, the Indians renounced their claims to all territory east of a
line running in a general way from the mouth of the Cuyahoga on Lake
Erie to the mouth of the Kentucky on the Ohio, leaving to the whites
the better portion of Ohio valley, including their favorite hunting
ground of Kentucky. The Delaware, the Wyandot, and the Shawano, three
of the leading tribes, were almost completely shorn of their ancient
inheritance and driven back as refugees among the Miami.

The Canadian boundary had been established along the lakes; the Ohio
was lost to the Indians; for them there was left only extermination or
removal to the west. Their bravest warriors were slain. Their ablest
chieftain, who had led them to victory against St Clair, had bowed to
the inevitable, and was now regarded as one with a white man’s heart
and a traitor to his race. A brooding dissatisfaction settled down on
the tribes. Who shall deliver them from the desolation that has come on
them?

Now arose among the Shawano another prophet to point out to his
people the “open door” leading to happiness. In November, 1805, a
young man named Laulewasikaw (Lalawe′thika, a rattle or similar
instrument—_Gatschet_), then hardly more than 30 years of age, called
around him his tribesmen and their allies at their ancient capital of
Wapakoneta, within the present limits of Ohio, and there announced
himself as the bearer of a new revelation from the Master of Life, who
had taken pity on his red children and wished to save them from the
threatened destruction. He declared that he had been taken up to the
spirit world and had been permitted to lift the veil of the past and
the future—had seen the misery of evil doers and learned the happiness
that awaited those who followed the precepts of the Indian god. He
then began an earnest exhortation, denouncing the witchcraft practices
and medicine juggleries of the tribe, and solemnly warning his hearers
that none who had part in such things would ever taste of the future
happiness. The firewater of the whites was poison and accursed; and
those who continued its use would after death be tormented with all
the pains of fire, while flames would continually issue from their
mouths. This idea may have been derived from some white man’s teaching
or from the Indian practice of torture by fire. The young must cherish
and respect the aged and infirm. All property must be in common,
according to the ancient law of their ancestors. Indian women must
cease to intermarry with white men; the two races were distinct and
must remain so. The white man’s dress, with his flint-and-steel, must
be discarded for the old time buckskin and the firestick. More than
this, every tool and every custom derived from the whites must be put
away, and they must return to the methods which the Master of Life had
taught them. When they should do all this, he promised that they would
again be taken into the divine favor, and find the happiness which
their fathers had known before the coming of the whites. Finally, in
proof of his divine mission, he announced that he had received power
to cure all diseases and to arrest the hand of death in sickness or
on the battlefield. (_Drake_, _Tecumseh, 1._) To avoid repetition, it
may be stated that, except when otherwise noted, the principal facts
concerning Tecumtha and the prophet are taken from Drake’s work, the
most valuable published on the subject. The prophet and his doctrines
are also spoken of at some length by Tanner, Kendall, Warren, and
Catlin, as hereafter quoted, while the history of Tecumtha is a part of
the history of Ohio valley, to be found in any work treating of that
section and period.)

In an account quoted by Drake, probably from an English writer, it is
stated that the prophet was noted for his stupidity and intoxication
until his fiftieth (?) year, when one day, while lighting his pipe in
his cabin, he suddenly fell back apparently lifeless and remained in
that condition until his friends had assembled for the funeral, when
he revived from his trance, and after quieting their alarm, announced
that he had been to the spirit world and commanded them to call the
people together that he might tell them what he had seen. When they had
assembled, he declared that he had been conducted to the border of the
spirit world by two young men, who had permitted him to look in upon
its pleasures, but not to enter, and who, after charging him with the
message to his people already noted, had left him, promising to visit
him again at a future time. (_Drake, Ab. Races, 1._)

Although the language of this account is somewhat overdrawn, the main
statements are probably correct, as it is in complete accordance with
the Indian system by which all truth has been revealed in dreams and
trances from the first dawn of tradition down to Smohalla and the
messiah of the Ghost dance.

His words aroused an intense excitement among his hearers, and the
impression deepened as the tidings of the new gospel were carried from
camp to camp. Those who were addicted to drunkenness—the besetting
sin of the Indians since their acquaintance with the whites—were so
thoroughly alarmed at the prospect of a fiery punishment in the spirit
world that for a long time intoxication became practically unknown
among the western tribes. Their zeal led also to the inauguration of
a crusade against all who were suspected of dealing in witchcraft or
magic arts; but here the prophet took advantage of this feeling to
effectually rid himself of all who opposed his sacred claims. It was
only necessary for him to denounce such a person as a witch to have him
pay the forfeit with reputation, if not with life.

  Among the first of his victims were several Delawares—Tatepocoshe
  (more generally known as Teteboxti), Patterson, his nephew,
  Coltos, an old woman, and an aged man called Joshua. These were
  successively marked by the prophet, and doomed to be burnt alive.
  The tragedy was commenced with the old woman. The Indians roasted
  her slowly over a fire for four days, calling upon her frequently
  to deliver up her charm and medicine bag. Just as she was dying,
  she exclaimed that her grandson, who was then out hunting, had it
  in his possession. Messengers were sent in pursuit of him, and when
  found he was tied and brought into camp. He acknowledged that on
  one occasion he had borrowed the charm of his grandmother, by means
  of which he had flown through the air over Kentucky, to the banks
  of the Mississippi, and back again, between twilight and bedtime;
  but he insisted that he had returned the charm to its owner, and,
  after some consultation, he was set at liberty. The following
  day a council was held over the case of the venerable chief
  Tatepocoshe, he being present. His death was decided upon after
  full deliberation; and, arrayed in his finest apparel, he calmly
  assisted in building his own funeral pile, fully aware that there
  was no escape from the judgment that had been passed upon him. The
  respect due to his whitened locks induced his executioners to treat
  him with mercy. He was deliberately tomahawked by a young man, and
  his body was then placed upon the blazing fagots and consumed. The
  next day the old preacher Joshua met a similar fate. The wife of
  Tatepocoshe and his nephew Billy Patterson were then brought into
  the council house and seated side by side. The latter had led an
  irreproachable life, and died like a Christian, singing and praying
  amid the flames which destroyed his body. While preparations were
  making for the immolation of Tatepocoshe’s wife, her brother, a
  youth of 20 years of age, suddenly started up, took her by the
  hand, and, to the amazement of the council, led her out of the
  house. He soon returned, and exclaiming, “The devil has come among
  us (alluding to the prophet), and we are killing each other,” he
  reseated himself in the midst of the crowd. This bold step checked
  the wild frenzy of the Indians, put an end to these cruel scenes,
  and for a time greatly impaired the impostor’s influence among the
  Delawares. (_Drake, Tecumseh, 2._)

The prophet now changed his name to Tenskwatawa, “The Open Door” (from
_skwa′te_, a door, and _the′nui_, to be open; frequently spelled
Elskwatawa), significant of the new mode of life which he had come to
point out to his people, and fixed his headquarters at Greenville,
Ohio, where representatives from the various scattered tribes of
the northwest gathered about him to learn the new doctrines. Some,
especially the Kickapoo, entered fervently into his spirit, while
others were disposed to oppose him. The Miami, who regarded the Shawano
as intruders, were jealous of his influence, and the chiefs of his
own tribe were somewhat inclined to consider him in the light of a
rival. To establish his sacred character and to dispel the doubts of
the unbelievers, he continued to dream dreams and announce wonderful
revelations from time to time, when an event occurred which effectually
silenced opposition and stamped him as one inspired.

By some means he had learned that an eclipse of the sun was to take
place in the summer of 1806. As the time drew near, he called about him
the scoffers and boldly announced that on a certain day he would prove
to them his supernatural authority by causing the sun to become dark.
When the day and hour arrived and the earth at midday was enveloped
in the gloom of twilight, Tenskwatawa, standing in the midst of the
terrified Indians, pointed to the sky and cried, “Did I not speak
truth? See, the sun is dark!” There were no more doubters now. All
proclaimed him a true prophet and the messenger of the Master of Life.
His fame spread abroad and apostles began to carry his revelations to
the remotest tribes.

We get but fragmentary light in regard to the details of the doctrine
and ceremonies of this religious revival, as well as of that which
preceded it. There were then no railroads, no newspaper correspondents
to gather each day’s proceedings, and no telegraph to flash the news
across the continent before nightfall; no reservation system, with its
attendant army of employees, everyone a spy when an emergency arose;
and no investigators to go among the tribes and study the matter
from an ethnologic point of view. Our information is derived chiefly
from military officers, who knew these things only as vague rumors
of Indian unrest fomented by British agents; from the statements of
a few illiterate interpreters or captives among the savages, and
from the misty recollections of old men long after the excitement
had passed away. Of the dances which are a part of every important
Indian ceremony, the songs which they chanted, the peculiar dress or
adornments which probably distinguished the believers—of all these we
know nothing; but we may well surmise that the whole elaborate system
of Indian mythology and ceremonial was brought into play to give weight
to the words of the prophet, and enough is known to show that in its
leading features the movement closely resembled the modern Ghost dance.

It is impossible to know how far the prophet was responsible for the
final shaping of the doctrine. Like all such movements, it undoubtedly
grew and took more definite form under the hands of the apostles who
went out from the presence of its originator to preach to the various
tribes. A religion which found adherents alike in the everglades
of Florida and on the plains of the Saskatchewan must necessarily
have undergone local modifications. From a comparison of the various
accounts we can arrive at a general statement of the belief.

The prophet was held to be an incarnation of Manabozho, the great
“first doer” of the Algonquian system. His words were believed to be
the direct utterances of a deity. Manabozho had taught his people
certain modes of living best suited to their condition and capacity.
A new race had come upon them, and the Indians had thrown aside their
primitive purity of life and adopted the innovations of the whites,
which had now brought them to degradation and misery and threatened
them with swift and entire destruction. To punish them for their
disobedience and bring them to a sense of their duty, Manabozho had
called the game from the forests and shut it up under the earth, so
that the tribes were now on the verge of starvation and obliged to eat
the flesh of filthy hogs. They had also lost their old love for one
another and become addicted to the secret practices of the poisoner
and the wizard, together with the abominable ceremonies of the calumet
dance. They must now put aside all these things, throw away the weapons
and the dress of the white man, pluck out their hair as in ancient
times, wear the eagle feather on their heads, and clothe themselves
again with the breechcloth and the skins of animals slain with the
bows and arrows which Manabozho had given them. (_Kendall, 1._) They
must have done with the white man’s flint-and-steel, and cook their
food over a fire made by rubbing together two sticks, and this fire
must always be kept burning in their lodges, as it was a symbol of the
eternal life, and their care for it was an evidence of their heed to
the divine commands. The firewater must forever be put away, together
with the medicine bags and poisons and the wicked juggleries which had
corrupted the ancient purity of the Midé rites. Instead of these the
prophet gave them new songs and new medicines. Their women must cease
from any connection with white men. They were to love one another and
make an end of their constant wars, to be kind to their children, to
keep but one dog in a family, and to abstain from lying and stealing.
If they would listen to his voice and follow his instructions, the
incarnate Manabozho promised that at the end of four years (i. e., in
1811) he would bring on two days of darkness, during which he would
travel invisibly throughout the land, and cause the animals which he
had created to come forth again out of the earth. (_Kendall, 2._) They
were also promised that their dead friends would be restored to them.

The ideas as to the catastrophe that was to usher in the new era seem
to have varied according to the interpreter of the belief. Among the
Ottawa, and perhaps among the lake tribes generally, there was to be a
period of darkness, as already stated. Among the Cherokee, and probably
also among the Creek, it was believed that there would be a terrible
hailstorm, which would overwhelm with destruction both the whites
and the unbelievers of the red race, while the elect would be warned
in time to save themselves by fleeing to the high mountain tops. The
idea of any hostile combination against the white race seems to have
been no part of the doctrine. In the north, however, there is always a
plain discrimination against the Americans. The Great Father, through
his prophet, is represented as declaring himself to be the common
parent alike of Indians, English, French, and Spaniards; while the
Americans, on the contrary, “are not my children, but the children of
the evil spirit. They grew from the scum of the great water, when it
was troubled by an evil spirit and the froth was driven into the woods
by a strong east wind. They are numerous, but I hate them. They are
unjust; they have taken away your lands, which were not made for them.”
(_Kendall, 3._)

From the venerable James Wafford, of the Cherokee nation, the author
in 1891 obtained some interesting details in regard to the excitement
among the Cherokee. According to his statement, the doctrine first
came to them through the Creek about 1812 or 1813. It was probably
given to the Creek by Tecumtha and his party on their visit to that
tribe in the fall of 1811, as will be related hereafter. The Creek
were taught by their prophets that the old Indian life was soon to
return, when “instead of beef and bacon they would have venison, and
instead of chickens they would have turkeys.” Great sacred dances
were inaugurated, and the people were exhorted to be ready for what
was to come. From the south the movement spread to the Cherokee, and
one of their priests, living in what is now upper Georgia, began to
preach that on a day near at hand there would be a terrible storm,
with a mighty wind and hailstones as large as hominy mortars, which
would destroy from the face of the earth all but the true believers
who had previously taken refuge on the highest summits of the Great
Smoky mountains. Full of this belief, numbers of the tribe in Alabama
and Georgia abandoned their bees, their orchards, their slaves, and
everything else that might have come to them through the white man,
and, in spite of the entreaties and remonstrances of friends who put no
faith in the prediction, took up their toilsome march for the mountains
of Carolina. Wafford, who was then about 10 years of age, lived with
his mother and stepfather on Valley river, and vividly remembers the
troops of pilgrims, with their packs on their backs, fleeing from the
lower country to escape from the wrath to come. Many of them stopped
at the house of his stepfather, who, being a white man, was somewhat
better prepared than his neighbors to entertain travelers, and who took
the opportunity to endeavor to persuade them to turn back, telling
them that their hopes and fears alike were groundless. Some listened
to him and returned to their homes, but others went on and climbed the
mountain, where they waited until the appointed day arrived, only to
find themselves disappointed. Slowly and sadly then they took up their
packs once more and turned their faces homeward, dreading the ridicule
they were sure to meet there, but yet believing in their hearts that
the glorious coming was only postponed for a time. This excitement
among the Cherokee is noted at some length in the Cherokee Advocate of
November 16, 1844, published at Tahlequah, Cherokee Nation. Among the
Creek the excitement, intensified by reports of the struggle now going
on in the north, and fostered and encouraged by the emissaries of Spain
and England, grew and spread until it culminated in the summer of 1813
in the terrible Creek war.

Enough is known of the ceremonial of this religion to show that it must
have had an elaborate ritual. We learn from Warren that the adherents
of the prophet were accustomed to perform certain ceremonies in solemn
councils, and that, after he had prohibited the corrupt secret rites,
he introduced instead new medicines and songs, and that at the ancient
capital of the Ojibwa on Lake Superior the Indians collected in great
numbers and performed these dances and ceremonies day and night.
(_Warren, 1._) They were also instructed to dance naked, with their
bodies painted and with the warclub in their hands. (_Kendall, 4._) The
solemn rite of confirmation, known as “shaking hands with the prophet,”
was particularly impressive. From the narrative of John Tanner, a
white man captured when a child from his home in Kentucky and brought
up among the wild Ojibwa, we get the best contemporary account of the
advent of the new doctrine in the north and its effect on the lake
tribes. He says:

  It was while I was living here at Great Wood river that news
  came of a great man among the Shawneese, who had been favoured
  by a revelation of the mind and will of the Great Spirit. I was
  hunting in the prairie, at a great distance from my lodge, when
  I saw a stranger approaching. At first I was apprehensive of
  an enemy, but as he drew nearer, his dress showed him to be an
  Ojibbeway; but when he came up, there was something very strange
  and peculiar in his manner. He signified to me that I must go
  home, but gave no explanation of the cause. He refused to look at
  me or enter into any kind of conversation. I thought he must be
  crazy, but nevertheless accompanied him to my lodge. When we had
  smoked, he remained a long time silent, but at last began to tell
  me he had come with a message from the prophet of the Shawneese.
  “Henceforth,” said he, “the fire must never be suffered to go out
  in your lodge. Summer and winter, day and night, in the storm,
  or when it is calm, you must remember that the life in your body
  and the fire in your lodge are the same and of the same date.
  If you suffer your fire to be extinguished, at that moment your
  life will be at its end. You must not suffer a dog to live; you
  must never strike either a man, a woman, a child, or a dog. The
  prophet himself is coming to shake hands with you; but I have
  come before, that you may know what is the will of the Great
  Spirit, communicated to us by him, and to inform you that the
  preservation of your life, for a single moment, depends on your
  entire obedience. From this time forward we are neither to be
  drunk, to steal, to lie, or to go against our enemies. While we
  yield an entire obedience to these commands of the Great Spirit,
  the Sioux, even if they come to our country, will not be able to
  see us; we shall be protected and made happy.” I listened to all
  he had to say, but told him, in answer, that I could not believe
  we should all die in case our fire went out; in many instances,
  also, it would be difficult to avoid punishing our children; our
  dogs were useful in aiding us to hunt and take animals, so that I
  could not believe the Great Spirit had any wish to take them from
  us. He continued talking to us until late at night; then he lay
  down to sleep in my lodge. I happened to wake first in the morning,
  and, perceiving the fire had gone out, I called him to get up and
  see how many of us were living and how many dead. He was prepared
  for the ridicule I attempted to throw upon his doctrine, and told
  me that I had not yet shaken hands with the prophet. His visit had
  been to prepare me for this important event, and to make me aware
  of the obligations and risks I should incur, by entering into
  the engagement implied in taking in my hand the message of the
  prophet. I did not rest entirely easy in my unbelief. The Indians,
  generally, received the doctrine of this man with great humility
  and fear. Distress and anxiety was visible in every countenance.
  Many killed their dogs, and endeavored to practice obedience to
  all the commands of this new preacher, who still remained among
  us. But, as was usual with me, in any emergency of this kind, I
  went to the traders, firmly believing that if the Deity had any
  communications to make to men, they would be given, in the first
  instance, to white men. The traders ridiculed and despised the
  idea of a new revelation of the Divine will, and the thought that
  it should be given to a poor Shawnee. Thus was I confirmed in my
  infidelity. Nevertheless, I did not openly avow my unbelief to
  the Indians, only I refused to kill my dogs, and showed no great
  degree of anxiety to comply with his other requirements. As long
  as I remained among the Indians, I made it my business to conform,
  as far as appeared consistent with my immediate convenience and
  comfort, with all their customs. Many of their ideas I have
  adopted, but I always found among them opinions which I could not
  hold. The Ojibbeway whom I have mentioned remained some time among
  the Indians in my neighborhood, and gained the attention of the
  principal men so effectually that a time was appointed and a lodge
  prepared for the solemn and public espousing of the doctrines of
  the prophet. When the people, and I among them, were brought into
  the long lodge, prepared for this solemnity, we saw something
  carefully concealed under a blanket, in figure and dimensions
  bearing some resemblance to the form of a man. This was accompanied
  by two young men, who, it was understood, attended constantly upon
  it, made its bed at night, as for a man, and slept near it. But
  while we remained no one went near it or raised the blanket which
  was spread over its unknown contents. Four strings of mouldy and
  discoloured beans were all the remaining visible insignia of this
  important mission. After a long harangue, in which the prominent
  features of the new revelation were stated and urged upon the
  attention of all, the four strings of beans, which we were told
  were made of the flesh itself of the prophet, were carried with
  much solemnity to each man in the lodge, and he was expected to
  take hold of each string at the top, and draw them gently through
  his hand. This was called shaking hands with the prophet, and was
  considered as solemnly engaging to obey his injunctions, and accept
  his mission as from the Supreme. All the Indians who touched the
  beans had previously killed their dogs; they gave up their medicine
  bags, and showed a disposition to comply with all that should be
  required of them.

  We had now been for some time assembled in considerable numbers.
  Much agitation and terror had prevailed among us, and now famine
  began to be felt. The faces of men wore an aspect of unusual
  gloominess; the active became indolent, and the spirits of the
  bravest seemed to be subdued. I started to hunt with my dogs, which
  I had constantly refused to kill or suffer to be killed. By their
  assistance, I found and killed a bear. On returning home, I said to
  some of the Indians, “Has not the Great Spirit given us our dogs to
  aid us in procuring what is needful for the support of our life,
  and can you believe he wishes now to deprive us of their services?
  The prophet, we are told, has forbid us to suffer our fire to be
  extinguished in our lodges, and when we travel or hunt, he will not
  allow us to use a flint and steel, and we are told he requires that
  no man should give fire to another. Can it please the Great Spirit
  that we should lie in our hunting camps without fire, or is it
  more agreeable to him that we should make fire by rubbing together
  two sticks than with a flint and a piece of steel?” But they would
  not listen to me; and the serious enthusiasm which prevailed among
  them so far affected me that I threw away my flint and steel, laid
  aside my medicine bag, and, in many particulars, complied with the
  new doctrines; but I would not kill my dogs. I soon learned to
  kindle a fire by rubbing some dry cedar, which I was careful to
  carry always about me, but the discontinuance of the use of flint
  and steel subjected many of the Indians to much inconvenience and
  suffering. The influence of the Shawnee prophet was very sensibly
  and painfully felt by the remotest Ojibbeways of whom I had any
  knowledge, but it was not the common impression among them that
  his doctrines had any tendency to unite them in the accomplishment
  of any human purpose. For two or three years drunkenness was much
  less frequent than formerly, war was less thought of, and the
  entire aspect of affairs among them was somewhat changed by the
  influence of one man. But gradually the impression was obliterated;
  medicine bags, flints, and steels were resumed; dogs were raised,
  women and children were beaten as before, and the Shawnee prophet
  was despised. At this day he is looked upon by the Indians as an
  impostor and a bad man. (_Tanner, 1._)

Tanner’s account is confirmed by Warren, from the statements of old men
among the Ojibwa who had taken part in the revival. According to their
story the ambassadors of the new revelation appeared at the different
villages, acting strangely and with their faces painted black—perhaps
to signify their character as messengers from the world of shades.
They told the people that they must light a fire with two dry sticks
in each of their principal settlements, and that this fire must
always be kept sacred and burning. They predicted the speedy return
of the old Indian life, and asserted that the prophet would cause the
dead to rise from the grave. The new belief took sudden and complete
possession of the minds of the Ojibwa and spread “like wildfire” from
end to end of their widely extended territory, and even to the remote
northern tribes in alliance with the Cree and Asiniboin. The strongest
evidence of their implicit obedience to the new revelation was given
by their attention to the command to throw away their medicine bags,
the one thing which every Indian holds most sacred. It is said that
the shores of Lake Superior, in the vicinity of the great village of
Shagawaumikong (Bayfield, Wisconsin), were strewn with these medicine
bags, which had been cast into the water. At this ancient capital of
the tribe the Ojibwa gathered in great numbers, to dance the dances and
sing the songs of the new ritual, until a message was received from
the prophet inviting them to come to him at Detroit, where he would
explain in person the will of the Master of Life. This was in 1808.
The excitement was now at fever heat, and it was determined to go in
a body to Detroit. It is said that 150 canoe loads of Ojibwa actually
started on this pilgrimage, and one family even brought with them a
dead child to be restored to life by the prophet. They had proceeded
a considerable distance when they were met by an influential French
trader, who reported, on the word of some who had already visited the
prophet’s camp and returned, that the devotees there were on the brink
of starvation—which was true, as the great multitude had consumed their
entire supply of provisions, and had been so occupied with religious
ceremonies that they had neglected to plant their corn. It was also
asserted that during the prophet’s frequent periods of absence from
the camp, when he would disappear for several days, claiming on his
return that he had been to the spirit world in converse with the Master
of Life, that he was really concealed in a hollow log in the woods.
This is quite probable, and entirely consistent with the Indian theory
of trances and soul pilgrimages while the body remains unconscious in
one spot. These reports, however, put such a damper on the ardor of
the Ojibwa that they returned to their homes and gradually ceased to
think about the new revelation. As time went on a reaction set in, and
those who had been most active evangelists of the doctrine among the
tribe became most anxious to efface the remembrance of it. One good,
however, resulted to the Ojibwa from the throwing away of the poisonous
compounds formerly in common use by the lower order of doctors, and
secret poisoning became almost unknown. (_Warren, 2._)

When the celebrated traveler Catlin went among the prairie tribes some
thirty years later, he found that the prophet’s emissaries—he says the
prophet himself, which is certainly a mistake—had carried the living
fire, the sacred image, and the mystic strings (see portrait and
description) even to the Blackfeet on the plains of the Saskatchewan,
going without hindrance among warring tribes where the name of the
Shawano had never been spoken, protected only by the reverence that
attached to their priestly character. There seems no doubt that by
this time they had developed the plan of a confederacy for driving
back the whites, and Catlin asserts that thousands of warriors among
those remote tribes had pledged themselves to fight under the lead of
Tecumtha at the proper time. His account of the prophet’s methods in
the extreme northwest agrees with what Tanner has reported from the
Ojibwa country. (_Catlin, 1._) But disaster followed him like a shadow.
Rivals, jealous of his success, came after him to denounce his plans as
visionary and himself as an impostor. The ambassadors were obliged to
turn back to save their lives and retrace their way in haste to the far
distant Wabash, where the fatal battle of Tippecanoe and the death of
his great brother, Tecumtha, put an end to all his splendid dreams.




                             +Chapter IV+

                        TECUMTHA AND TIPPECANOE

  These lands are ours. No one has a right to remove us, because we
  were the first owners.—_Tecumtha to Wells, 1807._

  The Great Spirit gave this great island to his red children.
  He placed the whites on the other side of the big water. They
  were not contented with their own, but came to take ours from
  us. They have driven us from the sea to the lakes—we can go no
  farther.—_Tecumtha, 1810._

  The President may sit still in his town and drink his wine, while
  you and I will have to fight it out.—_Tecumtha to Harrison, 1810._


And now we begin to hear of the prophet’s brother, Tecumtha, the most
heroic character in Indian history. Tecumtha, “The Meteor,” was the
son of a chief and the worthy scion of a warrior race. His tribe, the
Shawano, made it their proud boast that they of all tribes had opposed
the most determined resistance to the encroachments of the whites. His
father had fallen under the bullets of the Virginians while leading
his warriors at the bloody battle of Point Pleasant, in 1774. His
eldest and dearest brother had lost his life in an attack on a southern
frontier post, and another had been killed fighting by his side at
Wayne’s victory in 1794. What wonder that the young Tecumtha declared
that his flesh crept at the sight of a white man!

But his was no mean spirit of personal revenge; his mind was too
noble for that. He hated the whites as the destroyers of his race,
but prisoners and the defenseless knew well that they could rely on
his honor and humanity and were safe under his protection. When only
a boy—for his military career began in childhood—he had witnessed
the burning of a prisoner, and the spectacle was so abhorrent to his
feelings that by an earnest and eloquent harangue he induced the party
to give up the practice forever. In later years his name was accepted
by helpless women and children as a guaranty of protection even in
the midst of hostile Indians. Of commanding figure, nearly six feet
in height and compactly built; of dignified bearing and piercing eye,
before whose lightning even a British general quailed; with the fiery
eloquence of a Clay and the clear-cut logic of a Webster; abstemious in
habit, charitable in thought and action, brave as a lion, but humane
and generous withal—in a word, an aboriginal American knight—his life
was given to his people, and he fell at last, like his father and his
brothers before him, in battle with the destroyers of his nation, the
champion of a lost cause and a dying race.

His name has been rendered “The Shooting Star” and “The Panther
Crouching, or Lying in Wait.” From a reply to a letter of inquiry
addressed to Professor A. S. Gatschet, the well-known philologist, I
extract the following, which throws valuable light on the name system
and mythology of the Shawano, and shows also that the two renderings,
apparently so dissimilar, have a common origin:

  Shawano personal names are nearly all clan names, and by their
  interpretation the clan to which the individual or his father or
  mother belongs may be discovered. Thus, when a man is called “tight
  fitting” or “good fit,” he is of the _Rabbit_ clan, because the
  fur fits the rabbit very tightly and closely. The name of Tecumtha
  is derived from _nila ni tka′mthka_, “I cross the path or way of
  somebody, or of an animal.” This indicates that the one so named
  belongs to the clan of the round-foot or claw-foot animals, as
  panther, lion, or even raccoon. Tecumtha and his brother belonged
  to the clan of the manetuwi msipessi or “miraculous panther”
  (_msi_, great, big; _pishiwi_, abbreviated _pessi_, cat, both
  combined meaning the American lion). So the translations “panther
  lying in wait,” or “crouching lion,” give only the sense of the
  name, and no animal is named in it. But the _msi-pessi_, when the
  epithet miraculous (_manetuwi_) is added to it, means a “celestial
  tiger,” i. e., a meteor or shooting star. The _manetuwi msi-pessi_
  lives in water only and is visible not as an animal, but as a
  shooting star, and exceeding in size other shooting stars. This
  monster gave name to a Shawano clan, and this clan, to which
  Tecumtha belonged, was classed among the claw-foot animals also.
  The quick motion of the shooting star was correctly likened to that
  of a tiger or wildcat rushing upon his prey. Shooting stars are
  supposed to be souls of great men all over America. The home of the
  dead is always in the west, where the celestial bodies set, and
  since meteors travel westward they were supposed to return to their
  western home.

  to produce revolutions and overturn the established order of

                       EXPLANATION OF FIGURE 58

  This portrait is a copy of the one given by Lossing in his American
  Revolution and the War of 1812, +III.+ (1875), page 283. He quotes
  a description of Tecumtha’s personal appearance by a British
  officer who saw him in 1812, and then goes on to give the history
  of the portrait. “Captain J. B. Glegg, Brock’s aid-de-camp, has
  left on record the following description of Tecumtha at that
  interview: ‘Tecumseh’s appearance was very prepossessing; his
  figure light and finely proportioned; his age I imagined to be
  about five and thirty [he was about forty]; in height, 5 feet 9
  or 10 inches; his complexion light copper; countenance oval, with
  bright hazel eyes, bearing cheerfulness, energy, and decision.
  Three small silver crosses or coronets were suspended from the
  lower cartilage of his aquiline nose, and a large silver medallion
  of George the Third, which I believe his ancestor had received from
  Lord Dorchester when governor-general of Canada, was attached to
  a mixed-colored wampum string and hung round his neck. His dress
  consisted of a plain, neat uniform, tanned deerskin jacket, with
  long trowsers of the same material, the seams of both being covered
  with neatly cut fringe, and he had on his feet leather moccasins,
  much ornamented with work made from the dyed quills of the
  porcupine.’ The portrait of Tecumtha above given is from a pencil
  sketch by Pierre Le Dru.... In this I have given only the head by
  Le Dru. The cap was red, and in front was a single eagle’s feather,
  black, with a white tip. The sketch of his dress (and the medal
  above described), in which he appears as a brigadier-general of
  the British army, is from a rough drawing, which I saw in Montreal
  in the summer of 1858, made at Malden soon after the surrender of
  Detroit, where the Indians celebrated that event by a grand feast.
  It was only on gala occasions that Tecumtha was seen in full dress.
  The sketch did not pretend to give a true likeness of the chief,
  and was valuable only as a delineation of his costume. From the
  two we are enabled to give a pretty faithful picture of the great
  Shawnoese warrior and statesman as he appeared in his best mood.
  When in full dress he wore a cocked hat and plume, but would not
  give up his blue breechcloth, red leggings fringed with buckskin,
  and buckskin moccasins.”

Tecumtha was now in the prime of manhood, being about 40 years of
age, and had already thought out his scheme of uniting all the tribes
in one grand confederation to resist the further encroachments of
the whites, on the principle that the Indians had common interests,
and that what concerned one tribe concerned all. As the tribes were
constantly shifting about, following the game in its migrations, he
held that no one tribe had any more than a possessory right to the
land while in actual occupancy, and that any sale of lands, to be
valid, must be sanctioned by all the tribes concerned. His claim was
certainly founded in justice, but the government refused to admit the
principle in theory, although repeatedly acting on it in practice,
for every important treaty afterward made in Mississippi valley was
a joint treaty, as it was found impossible to assign the ownership
of any considerable section to any one particular tribe. The Shawano
themselves hunted from the Cumberland to the Susquehanna. As a basal
proposition, Tecumtha claimed that the Greenville treaty, having been
forced on the Indians, was invalid; that the only true boundary was the
Ohio, as established in 1768, and that all future cessions must have
the sanction of all the tribes claiming rights in that region.

By this time there were assembled at Greenville to listen to the
teachings of the prophet hundreds of savages, representing all the
widely extended tribes of the late region and the great northwest, all
wrought up to the highest pitch of excitement over the prospect of
a revival of the old Indian life and the perpetuation of aboriginal
sovereignty. This was Tecumtha’s opportunity, and he was quick to
improve it. Even those who doubted the spiritual revelations could see
that they were in danger from the continued advances of the whites,
and were easily convinced that safety required that they should unite
as one people for the preservation of a common boundary. The pilgrims
carried back these ideas to their several tribes, and thus what was at
first a simple religious revival soon became a political agitation.
They were equally patriotic from the Indian point of view, and under
the circumstances one was almost the natural complement of the other.
All the evidence goes to show that the movement in its inception was
purely religious and peaceable; but the military spirit of Tecumtha
afterward gave to it a warlike and even aggressive character, and
henceforth the apostles of the prophet became also recruiting agents
for his brother. Tecumtha himself was too sensible to think that the
whites would be destroyed by any interposition of heaven, or that they
could be driven out by any combination of the Indians, but he did
believe it possible that the westward advance of the Americans could
be stopped at the Ohio, leaving his people in undisturbed possession
of what lay beyond. In this hope he was encouraged by the British
officials in Canada, and it is doubtful if the movement would ever have
become formidable if it had not been incited and assisted from across
the line.

In the spring of 1807 it was estimated that at Fort Wayne fifteen
hundred Indians had recently passed that post on their way to visit
the prophet, while councils were constantly being held and runners
were going from tribe to tribe with pipes and belts of wampum. It
was plain that some uncommon movement was going on among them, and
it also was evident that the British agents had a hand in keeping up
the excitement. The government became alarmed, and the crisis came
when an order was sent from the President to Tecumtha at Greenville
to remove his party beyond the boundary of 1795 (the Greenville
treaty). Trembling with excitement, Tecumtha rose and addressed his
followers in a passionate speech, dwelling on the wrongs of the Indians
and the continued encroachments of the whites. Then, turning to the
messenger, he said, “These lands are ours. No one has a right to
remove us, because we were the first owners. The Great Spirit above
has appointed this place for us, on which to light our fires, and
here we will remain. As to boundaries, the Great Spirit above knows
no boundaries nor will his red children acknowledge any.” (_Drake,
Tecumseh, 3._) From this time it was understood that the Indians were
preparing to make a final stand for the valley of the Ohio. The prophet
continued to arouse their enthusiasm by his inspired utterances, while
Tecumtha became the general and active organizer of the warriors.
At a conference with the governor of Ohio in the autumn of 1807 he
fearlessly denied the validity of the former treaties, and declared his
intention to resist the further extension of the white settlements on
Indian lands.

The next spring great numbers of Indians came down from the lakes to
visit Tecumtha and his brother, who, finding their following increasing
so rapidly, accepted an invitation from the Potawatomi and Kickapoo,
and removed their headquarters to a more central location on the
Wabash. The Delaware and Miami, who claimed precedence in that region
and who had all along opposed the prophet and Tecumtha, protested
against this move, but without effect. The new settlement, which was on
the western bank of the river, just below the mouth of the Tippecanoe,
was known to the Indians as Kehtipaquononk, “the great clearing,” and
was an old and favorite location with them. It had been the site of
a large Shawano village which had been destroyed by the Americans in
1791, and some years later the Potawatomi had rebuilt upon the same
place, to which they now invited the disciples of the new religion.
The whites had corrupted the name to Tippecanoe, and it now generally
became known as the Prophet’s town.

Nothing else of moment occurred during this year, but it was learned
that Tecumtha contemplated visiting the southern tribes in the near
future to enlist them also in his confederacy. In 1809, however,
rumors of an approaching outbreak began to fill the air, and it was
evident that the British were instigating the Indians to mischief in
anticipation of a war between England and the United States. Just at
this juncture the anger of Tecumtha’s party was still further inflamed
by the negotiation of treaties with four tribes by which additional
large tracts were ceded in Indiana and Illinois. The Indians now
refused to buy ammunition from the American traders, saying that they
could obtain all they wanted for nothing in another quarter. In view of
the signs of increasing hostility, Governor Harrison was authorized to
take such steps as might be necessary to protect the frontier. Tecumtha
had now gained over the Wyandot, the most influential tribe of the Ohio
region, the keepers of the great wampum belt of union and the lighters
of the council fire of the allied tribes. Their example was speedily
followed by the Miami, whose adhesion made the tribes of the Ohio and
the lakes practically unanimous. The prophet now declared that he would
follow in the steps of Pontiac, and called on the remote tribes to
assist those on the border to roll back the tide which would otherwise
overwhelm them all. In return, the Sauk and Fox sent word that they
were ready whenever he should say the word.

In the summer of 1810, according to a previous arrangement, Tecumtha,
attended by several hundred warriors, descended the river to Vincennes
to confer with Governor Harrison on the situation. The conference began
on the 15th of August and lasted three days. Tecumtha reiterated his
former claims, saying that in uniting the tribes he was endeavoring
to dam the mighty water that was ready to overflow his people. The
Americans had driven the Indians from the sea and threatened to push
them into the lakes; and, although he disclaimed any intention of
making war against the United States, he declared his fixed resolution
to insist on the old boundary and to oppose the further intrusion of
the whites on the lands of the Indians, and to resist the survey of
the lands recently ceded. He was followed by chiefs of five different
tribes, each of whom in turn declared that he would support the
principles of Tecumtha. Harrison replied that the government would
never admit that any section belonged to all the Indians in common,
and that, having bought the ceded lands from the tribes who were first
found in possession of them, it would defend its title by arms. To this
Tecumtha said that he preferred to be on the side of the Americans,
and that if his terms were conceded he would bring his forces to the
aid of the United States in the war which he knew was soon to break
out with England, but that otherwise he would be compelled to join
the British. The governor replied that he would state the case to the
President, but that it was altogether unlikely that he would consent to
the conditions. Recognizing the inevitable, Tecumtha expressed the hope
that, as the President was to determine the matter, the Great Spirit
would put sense into his head to induce him to give up the lands,
adding, “It is true, he is so far off he will not be injured by the
war. He may sit still in his town and drink his wine, while you and I
will have to fight it out.” The governor then requested that in the
event of an Indian war Tecumtha would use his influence to prevent the
practice of cruelties on women and children and defenseless prisoners.
To this he readily agreed, and the promise was faithfully kept.
(_Drake, Tecumseh, 4._)

The conference had ended with a tacit understanding that war must
come, and both sides began to prepare for the struggle. Soon after it
was learned that the prophet had sent belts to the tribes west of the
Mississippi, inviting them to join in a war against the United States.
Outrages on the Indians by settlers intensified the hostile feeling,
and the Delawares refused to deliver up a murderer until some of the
whites who had killed their people were first punished. Harrison
himself states that the Indians could rarely obtain satisfaction for
the most unprovoked wrongs. In another letter he says that Tecumtha
“has taken for his model the celebrated Pontiac, and I am persuaded he
will bear a favorable comparison in every respect with that far-famed
warrior.”

In July, 1811, Tecumtha again, visited Harrison at Vincennes. In the
course of his talk he said that the whites were unnecessarily alarmed,
as the Indians were only following the example set them by the colonies
in uniting for the furtherance of common interests. He added that he
was now on his way to the southern tribes to obtain their adhesion
also to the league, and that on his return in the spring he intended
to visit the President to explain his purposes fully and to clear away
all difficulties. In the meantime he expected that a large number of
Indians would join his colony on the Wabash during the winter, and to
avoid any danger of collision between them and the whites, he requested
that no settlements should be made on the disputed lands until he
should have an opportunity to see the President. To this Harrison
replied that the President would never give up a country which he
had bought from its rightful owners, nor would he suffer his people
to be injured with impunity. This closed the interview, and the next
day Tecumtha started with his party for the south to visit the Creek
and Choctaw. About the same time it was learned that the British had
sent a message to the prophet, telling him that the time had now come
for him to take up the hatchet, and inviting him to send a party to
their headquarters at Malden (now Amherstburg, Ontario) to receive the
necessary supplies. In view of these things Harrison suggested to the
War Department that opportunity be taken of Tecumtha’s absence in the
south to strike a blow against his confederacy. Continuing in the same
letter, he says of the great Indian leader:

  The implicit obedience and respect which the followers of Tecumseh
  pay to him is really astonishing, and more than any other
  circumstance bespeaks him one of those uncommon geniuses which
  spring up occasionally to produce revolutions and overturn the
  established order of things. If it were not for the vicinity of the
  United States, he would perhaps be the founder of an empire that
  would rival in glory Mexico or Peru. No difficulties deter him. For
  four years he has been in constant motion. You see him to-day on
  the Wabash, and in a short time hear of him on the shores of Lake
  Erie or Michigan or on the banks of the Mississippi, and wherever
  he goes he makes an impression favorable to his purposes. He is now
  upon the last round, to put a finishing stroke to his work. I hope,
  however, before his return that that part of the fabric which he
  considered complete will be demolished, and even its foundations
  rooted up. (_Drake, Tecumseh, 5._)

On this trip Tecumtha went as far as Florida and engaged the Seminole
for his confederacy. Then, retracing his steps into Alabama, he came
to the ancient Creek town of Tukabachi, on the Tallapoosa, near the
present site of Montgomery. What happened here is best told in the
words of McKenney and Hall, who derived their information from Indians
at the same town a few years later:

  He made his way to the lodge of the chief called the Big Warrior.
  He explained his object, delivered his war talk, presented a bundle
  of sticks, gave a piece of wampum and a war hatchet—all which the
  Big Warrior took—when Tecumthé, reading the spirit and intentions
  of the Big Warrior, looked him in the eye, and, pointing his finger
  toward his face, said: “Your blood is white. You have taken my
  talk, and the sticks, and the wampum, and the hatchet, but you
  do not mean to fight. I know the reason. You do not believe the
  Great Spirit has sent me. You shall know. I leave Tuckhabatchee
  directly, and shall go straight to Detroit. When I arrive there, I
  will stamp on the ground with my foot and shake down every house
  in Tuckhabatchee.” So saying, he turned and left the Big Warrior
  in utter amazement at both his manner and his threat, and pursued
  his journey. The Indians were struck no less with his conduct than
  was the Big Warrior, and began to dread the arrival of the day
  when the threatened calamity would befall them. They met often and
  talked over this matter, and counted the days carefully to know the
  day when Tecumthé would reach Detroit. The morning they had fixed
  upon as the day of his arrival at last came. A mighty rumbling was
  heard—the Indians all ran out of their houses—the earth began to
  shake; when at last, sure enough, every house in Tuckhabatchee was
  shaken down. The exclamation was in every mouth, “Tecumthé has got
  to Detroit!” The effect was electric. The message he had delivered
  to the Big Warrior was believed, and many of the Indians took their
  rifles and prepared for the war. The reader will not be surprised
  to learn that an earthquake had produced all this; but he will be,
  doubtless, that it should happen on the very day on which Tecumthé
  arrived at Detroit, and in exact fulfillment of his threat. It was
  the famous earthquake of New Madrid on the Mississippi. (_McKenney
  and Hall, 1._)

The fire thus kindled among the Creek by Tecumtha was fanned into a
blaze by the British and Spanish traders until the opening of the war
of 1812 gave the opportunity for the terrible outbreak known in history
as the Creek war.

While Tecumtha was absent in the south, affairs were rapidly
approaching a crisis on the Wabash. The border settlers demanded the
removal of the prophet’s followers, stating in their memorial to the
President that they were “fully convinced that the formation of this
combination headed by the Shawano prophet was a British scheme, and
that the agents of that power were constantly exciting the Indians
to hostility against the United States.” Governor Harrison now
sent messages to the different tribes earnestly warning them of the
consequences of a hostile outbreak, but about the same time the prophet
himself announced that he had now taken up the tomahawk against the
United States, and would only lay it down with his life, unless the
wrongs of the Indians were redressed. It was known also that he was
arousing his followers to a feverish pitch of excitement by the daily
practice of mystic rites.

[Illustration: +Fig. 59+—Harrison treaty pipe.]

Harrison now determined to break up the prophet’s camp. Accordingly,
at the head of about 900 men, including about 250 regulars, he marched
from Vincennes, and on the 5th of November, 1811, encamped within a
few miles of the prophet’s town. The Indians had fortified the place
with great care and labor. It was sacred to them as the spot where the
rites of the new religion had been so long enacted, and by these rites
they believed it had been rendered impregnable to the attacks of the
white man. The next day he approached still nearer, and was met by
messengers from the town, who stated that the prophet was anxious to
avoid hostilities and had already sent a pacific message by several
chiefs, who had unfortunately gone down on the other side of the river
and thus had failed to find the general. A truce was accordingly agreed
on until the next day, when terms of peace were to be arranged between
the governor and the chiefs. The army encamped on a spot pointed out
by the Indians, an elevated piece of ground rising out of a marshy
prairie, within a mile of the town. Although Harrison did not believe
that the Indians would make a night attack, yet as a precaution he had
the troops sleep on their arms in order of battle.

  At 4 o’clock in the morning of the 7th, Governor Harrison,
  according to his practice, had risen preparatory to the calling
  up the troops, and was engaged, while drawing on his boots by
  the fire, in conversation with General Wells, Colonel Owen, and
  Majors Taylor and Hurst. The orderly drum had been roused for the
  purpose of giving the signal for the troops to turn out, when the
  attack of the Indians suddenly commenced upon the left flank of the
  camp. The whole army was instantly on its feet, the campfires were
  extinguished, the governor mounted his horse and proceeded to the
  point of attack. Several of the companies had taken their places in
  the line within forty seconds from the report of the first gun, and
  the whole of the troops were prepared for action in the course of
  two minutes, a fact as creditable to their own activity and bravery
  as to the skill and bravery of their officers. The battle soon
  became general, and was maintained on both sides with signal and
  even desperate valor. The Indians advanced and retreated by the aid
  of a rattling noise, made with deer hoofs, and persevered in their
  treacherous attack with an apparent determination to conquer or
  die upon the spot. The battle raged with unabated fury and mutual
  slaughter until daylight, when a gallant and successful charge by
  our troops drove the enemy into the swamp and put an end to the
  conflict.

  Prior to the assault the prophet had given assurances to his
  followers that in the coming contest the Great Spirit would render
  the arms of the Americans unavailing; that their bullets would
  fall harmless at the feet of the Indians; that the latter should
  have light in abundance, while the former would be involved in
  thick darkness. Availing himself of the privilege conferred by his
  peculiar office, and perhaps unwilling in his own person to attest
  at once the rival powers of a sham prophecy and a real American
  bullet, he prudently took a position on an adjacent eminence, and
  when the action began, he entered upon the performance of certain
  mystic rites, at the same time singing a war song. In the course of
  the engagement he was informed that his men were falling. He told
  them to fight on—it would soon be as he had predicted. And then,
  in louder and wilder strains, his inspiring battle song was heard
  commingling with the sharp crack of the rifle and the shrill war
  whoop of his brave but deluded followers. (_Drake, Tecumseh, 6._)

Drake estimates the whole number of Indians engaged in the battle
at between 800 and 1,000, representing all the principal tribes of
the region, and puts the killed at probably not less than 50, with
an unusually large proportion of wounded. Harrison’s estimate would
seem to put the numbers much higher. The Americans lost 60 killed
or mortally wounded, and 188 in all. (_Drake, Tecumseh, 7._) In
their hurried retreat the Indians left a large number of dead on the
field. Believing on the word of the prophet that they would receive
supernatural aid from above, they had fought with desperate bravery,
and their defeat completely disheartened them. They at once abandoned
their town and dispersed, each to his own tribe. Tecumtha’s great
fabric was indeed demolished, and even its foundations rooted up.

The night before the engagement the prophet had performed some medicine
rites by virtue of which he had assured his followers that half of the
soldiers were already dead and the other half bereft of their senses,
so that the Indians would have little to do but rush into their camp
and finish them with the hatchet. The result infuriated the savages.
They refused to listen to the excuses which are always ready to the
tongue of the unsuccessful medicine-man, denounced him as a liar, and
even threatened him with death. Deserted by all but a few of his own
tribe, warned away from several villages toward which he turned his
steps, he found refuge at last among a small band of Wyandot; but his
influence and his sacred prestige were gone forever, and he lived out
his remaining days in the gloom of obscurity.

From the south Tecumtha returned through Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois,
everywhere making accessions to his cause, but reached the Wabash at
last, just a few days after the battle, only to find his followers
scattered to the four winds, his brother a refugee, and the great
object of his life—a confederation of all the tribes—brought to
nothing. His grief and disappointment were bitter. He reproached his
brother in unmeasured terms for disobeying his instructions to preserve
peace in his absence, and when the prophet attempted to reply, it is
said that Tecumtha so far forgot his dignity as to seize his brother by
the hair and give him a violent shaking, threatening to take his life.

Early in 1812 Tecumtha sent a message to Governor Harrison, informing
him of his return from the south, and stating that he was now ready to
make the proposed visit to the President. To this Harrison replied,
giving his permission, but refusing to allow any party to accompany
him. This stipulation did not please the great leader, who had been
accustomed to the attendance of a retinue of warriors wherever he went.
He declined the terms, and thus terminated his intercourse with the
governor. In June, 1812, he visited the agent at Fort Wayne, and there
reiterated the justice of his position in regard to the ownership of
the Indian lands, again disclaimed having had any intention of making
war against the United States, and reproached Harrison for marching
against his people in his absence. In return, the agent endeavored
to persuade him now to join forces with the United States in the
approaching conflict with England. “Tecumtha listened with frigid
indifference, made a few general remarks in reply, and then with a
haughty air left the council house and took his departure for Malden,
where he joined the British standard.” (_Drake, Tecumseh, 8._) His
subsequent career is a part of the history of the war of 1812.

Formal declaration of war against Great Britain was made by the United
States on June 18, 1812. Tecumtha was already at Malden, the British
headquarters on the Canadian side, and when invited by some friendly
Indians to attend a council near Detroit in order to make arrangements
for remaining neutral, he sent back word that he had taken sides with
the king, and that his bones would bleach on the Canadian shore before
he would recross the river to join in any council of neutrality. A few
days later he led his Indians into battle on the British side. For his
services at Maguaga he was soon afterward regularly commissioned a
brigadier general in the British army.

We pass over the numerous events of this war—Maguaga, the Raisin, Fort
Meigs, Perry’s victory—as being outside the scope of our narrative,
and come to the battle of the Thames, October 5, 1813, the last ever
fought by Tecumtha. After Perry’s decisive victory on the lake, Proctor
hastily prepared to retreat into the interior, despite the earnest
protests of Tecumtha, who charged him with cowardice, an imputation
which the British general did not dare to resent. The retreat was
begun with Harrison in close pursuit, until the British and Indians
reached a spot on the north bank of the Thames, in the vicinity of
the present Chatham, Ontario. Here, finding the ground favorable for
defense, Tecumtha resolved to retreat no farther, and practically
compelled Proctor to make a stand. The Indian leader had no hope of
triumph in the issue. His sun had gone down, and he felt himself
already standing in the shadow of death. He was done with life and
desired only to close it, as became a warrior, striking a last blow
against the hereditary enemy of his race. When he had posted his men,
he called his chiefs about him and calmly said, “Brother warriors, we
are now about to enter into an engagement from which I shall never come
out—my body will remain on the field of battle.” He then unbuckled his
sword, and, placing it in the hands of one of them, said, “When my son
becomes a noted warrior and able to wield a sword, give this to him.”
He then laid aside his British military dress and took his place in the
line, clothed only in the ordinary deerskin hunting shirt. (_Drake,
Tecumseh, 9._) When the battle began, his voice was heard encouraging
his men until he fell under the cavalry charge of the Americans, who
had already broken the ranks of the British regulars and forced them to
surrender. Deprived of their leader and deserted by their white allies,
the Indians gave up the unequal contest and fled from the field.
Tecumtha died in his forty-fourth year.

After the close of the war the prophet returned from Canada by
permission of this government and rejoined his tribe in Ohio, with
whom he removed to the west in 1827. (_Schoolcraft, Ind. Tribes, 2._)
Catlin, who met and talked with him in 1832, thus speaks of him:

  This, no doubt, has been a very shrewd and influential man, but
  circumstances have destroyed him, as they have many other great men
  before him, and he now lives respected, but silent and melancholy,
  in his tribe. I conversed with him a great deal about his brother
  Tecumseh, of whom he spoke frankly, and seemingly with great
  pleasure; but of himself and his own great schemes he would say
  nothing. He told me that Tecumseh’s plans were to embody all the
  Indian tribes in a grand confederacy, from the province of Mexico
  to the Great Lakes, to unite their forces in an army that would be
  able to meet and drive back the white people, who were continually
  advancing on the Indian tribes and forcing them from their lands
  toward the Rocky mountains; that Tecumseh was a great general,
  and that nothing but his premature death defeated his grand plan.
  (_Catlin, 2._)




                              +Chapter V+

                      KÄNAKÛK AND MINOR PROPHETS

                                KÄNAKÛK

  My father, the Great Spirit holds all the world in his hands. I
  pray to him that we may not be removed from our lands.... Take pity
  on us and let us remain where we are.—_Känakûk._

  I was singularly struck with the noble efforts of this champion of
  the mere remnant of a poisoned race, so strenuously laboring to
  rescue the remainder of his people from the deadly bane that has
  been brought amongst them by enlightened Christians.—_Catlin._

The scene now shifts to the west of the Mississippi. With the death of
Tecumtha the confederacy of the northwestern tribes fell to pieces, and
on the closing of the war of 1812 the government inaugurated a series
of treaties resulting, within twenty years, in the removal of almost
every tribe beyond the Mississippi and the appropriation of their
former country by the whites. Among others the Kickapoo, by the treaty
of Edwardsville in 1819, had ceded the whole of their ancient territory
in Illinois, comprising nearly one-half the area of the state, in
exchange for a much smaller tract on Osage river in Missouri and $3,000
in goods. (_Treaties, 1._) The government also agreed to furnish two
boats to take them up the river to their new home, where “the United
States promise to guarantee to the said tribe the peaceable possession
of the tract of land hereby ceded to them, and to restrain and prevent
all white persons from hunting, settling, or otherwise intruding upon
it.”

For some reason, however, the Kickapoo manifested no overwhelming
desire to remove from their villages and cornfields on the broad
prairies of Illinois to the rugged hills of Missouri. This may have
been due to the innate perversity of the savage, or possibly to the
fact that the new country guaranteed to them was already occupied by
their hereditary enemies, the Osage, who outnumbered the Kickapoo
three to one. To be sure, these aboriginal proprietors had agreed to
surrender the territory to the United States, but they were still at
home to all visitors, as the immigrant Cherokee had learned to their
cost. Be that as it may, several years passed and it began to be
suspected that the Kickapoo were not anxious to go west and grow up
with the country. Investigation disclosed the fact that, instead of
removing to the reservation on Osage river, one-half of the tribe had
gone southward in a body and crossed over to the Spanish side of Red
river (now Texas), where they might reasonably hope to be secure from
the further advance of the Americans. Others were preparing to follow,
and the government agents were instructed to make a strong effort to
effect the immediate removal of the tribe to Missouri and to prevent
the emigration of any more to the south.

[Illustration: +Fig. 60+—Känakûk the Kickapoo prophet.]

It now appeared that they were encouraged to hold their ground by a new
prophet who had sprung up among them, named Känakûk. The name (also
spelled Kee-an-ne-kuk and Kanacuk), refers to putting the foot upon a
fallen object, and does not denote “the foremost man,” as rendered by
Catlin. In a letter written to General Clark, in February, 1827—a few
days after the prophet himself had visited General Clark—the agent, Mr
Graham, after reporting his failure to induce the tribe to remove,
states that the prophet “had no idea of giving up his lands,” and
continues:

  This man has acquired an influence over his people through supposed
  revelations from God, which he urges on them with an eloquence,
  mildness, and firmness of manner that carries to their credulous
  ears conviction of his communications with God.

  To give a favorable turn to his mind, I apparently gave credence
  to his statements of these revelations, and attempted to put
  a construction on them for him. He listened to me with great
  attention, and, after I had finished, said I might be right;
  that God would talk to him again and he would let me know what
  he said. In the meantime he would use his influence to get his
  people to move, but that he could not himself come over until all
  had removed; that there were many bad men yet among them, whom
  he hoped to convert to the ways of God, and then all would come
  over. He would preach to his men and warn them from taking away or
  injuring the property of the white people, and if any white man
  struck them—to use his own expression—he would bow his head and not
  complain; he would stop any attempt to take revenge. He seems to
  have a wonderful influence over those Indians who accompanied him.
  They neither drank nor painted, were serious, though not gloomy.
  (_Ind. Off., 1._)

[Illustration: +Fig. 61+—Känakûk’s heaven.]

In the same month Känakûk himself visited General Clark at Saint Louis,
and in the course of a long talk explained the origin of his divine
mission and the nature of his doctrine, illustrating the subject by
means of a peculiar diagram (figure 61), and closing with an earnest
appeal in behalf of his people that they should be allowed to remain
undisturbed. Although it was said by the traders that he had stolen
his inspiration from a Methodist preacher, it is plain from an
examination of his doctrine that he was the direct spiritual successor
of Tenskwatawa and the Delaware prophet, who in their generation had
preached to the same tribe. Like his predecessors, also, he condemned
the use of “medicine bags” and medicine songs, which, although
universal among the tribes, seem to have been regarded by the better
class of Indians as witchcraft was in former days among the whites.

After the usual preliminary expressions of mutual friendship and good
will, Känakûk stated that all his people were united in sentiment, and
then proceeded to explain his religious views as follows:

  My father, the Great Spirit has placed us all on this earth; he
  has given to our nation a piece of land. Why do you want to take
  it away and give us so much trouble? We ought to live in peace
  and happiness among ourselves and with you. We have heard of some
  trouble about our land. I have come down to see you and have all
  explained.

                   *       *       *       *       *

  My father, the Great Spirit appeared to me; he saw my heart was in
  sorrow about our land; he told me not to give up the business, but
  go to my Great Father and he would listen to me. My father, when I
  talked to the Great Spirit, I saw the chiefs holding the land fast.
  He told me the life of our children was short and that the earth
  would sink.

  My father, I will explain to you what the Great Spirit said to
  me—to do so, I must make some marks. The Great Spirit says: My
  father, we started from this point (A, figure 61). We are here
  now (B). When we get here (C), the Great Spirit will appear to me
  again. Here (B) the Great Spirit gave his blessings to the Indians
  and told them to tell his people to throw away their medicine bags
  and not to steal, not to tell lies, not to murder, not to quarrel,
  and to burn their medicine bags. If they did not, they could not
  get on the straight way, but would have to go the crooked path of
  the bad here (D); that when we got to this place (the curved line,
  E), we would not be able to cross it unless we were all good. It
  was fire. That we should go to this place (E), where there would be
  collected all the red chiefs and there would be a great preaching.
  That if we had not thrown away all our bad doings, these two points
  would meet (D and E), and then the Great Spirit would destroy
  everything and the world would be turned over. That if we would be
  good and throw away all our bad doings, we would cross this fire,
  when we would [come] to water (second line), which we would cross.
  There we would come to a country where there was nothing but a
  prairie and nothing grew upon it. There the sun would be hid from
  us by four black clouds. When we get here (C), the Great Spirit
  will explain these round marks.

  My father, I have now explained as well as I can, with much pains,
  our situation. I wish you to tell me the truth and hide nothing
  from me. I have heard that some of your warriors are going to take
  up the tomahawk. I explained to you last fall our situation. We are
  now here (B), where we are in great trouble. I told you of all our
  troubles. I asked you to reflect on our situation and that we would
  come back to see you.

                   *       *       *       *       *

  My father, you call all the redskins your children. When we have
  children, we treat them well. That is the reason I make this long
  talk to get you to take pity on us and let us remain where we are.

  My father, I wish after my talk is over you would write to my Great
  Father, the president, that we have a desire to remain a little
  longer where we now are. I have explained to you that we have
  thrown all our badness away and keep the good path. I wish our
  Great Father could hear that. I will now talk to my Great Father,
  the president.

  My Great Father, I don’t know if you are the right chief, because
  I have heard some things go wrong. I wish you to reflect on our
  situation and let me know. I want to talk to you mildly and in
  peace, so that we may understand each other. When I saw the Great
  Spirit, he told me to throw all our bad acts away. We did so. Some
  of our chiefs said the land belonged to us, the Kickapoos; but this
  is not what the Great Spirit told me—the lands belong to him. The
  Great Spirit told me that no people owned the lands—that all was
  his, and not to forget to tell the white people that when we went
  into council. When I saw the Great Spirit, he told me, Mention all
  this to your Great Father. He will take pity on your situation and
  let you remain on the lands where you are for some years, when you
  will be able to get through all the bad places (the marks in the
  figure), and where you will get to a clear piece of land where you
  will all live happy. When I talked to the Great Spirit, he told
  me to make my warriors throw their tomahawks in the bad place. I
  did so, and every night and morning I raise my hands to the Great
  Spirit and pray to him to give us success. I expect, my father,
  that God has put me in a good way—that our children shall see their
  sisters and brothers and our women see their children. They will
  grow up and travel and see their totems. The Great Spirit told me,
  “Our old men had totems. They were good and had many totems. Now
  you have scarcely any. If you follow my advice, you will soon have
  totems again.” Say this to my Great Father for me.[2]

                   *       *       *       *       *

  My father, since I talked with the Great Spirit, our women and
  children and ourselves, we have not such good clothes, but we don’t
  mind that. We think of praying every day to the Great Spirit to get
  us safe to the good lands, where all will be peace and happiness.

  My father, the Great Spirit holds all the world in his hands. I
  pray to him that we may not be removed from our land until we can
  see and talk to all our totems....

  My father, when I left my women and children, they told me, “As you
  are going to see our Great Father, tell him to let us alone and let
  us eat our victuals with a good heart.”

                   *       *       *       *       *

  My father, since my talk with the Great Spirit we have nothing
  cooked until the middle of the day. The children get nothing in the
  morning to eat. We collect them all to pray to the Great Spirit to
  make our hearts pure, and then eat. We bring our children up to be
  good.

  My father, I will tell you all I know. I will put nothing on my
  back. God told me, Whenever you make a talk, tell everything true.
  Keep nothing behind, and then you will find everything go right.

                   *       *       *       *       *

  My father, when I talked with the Great Spirit, he did not tell me
  to sell my lands, because I did not know how much was a dollar’s
  worth, or the game that run on it. If he told me so, I would tell
  you to-day.

  My father, you have heard what I have said. I have represented to
  you our situation, and ask you to take pity on us and let us remain
  where we are....

  My father, I have shown you in the lines I have made the bad
  places. Our warriors even are afraid of those dark places you see
  there. That is the reason they threw their tomahawks aside and put
  up their hands to the Great Spirit.

                   *       *       *       *       *

  My father, every time we eat we raise our hands to the Great Spirit
  to give us success.

  My father, we are sitting by each other here to tell the truth. If
  you write anything wrong, the Great Spirit will know it. If I say
  anything not true, the Great Spirit will hear it.

  My father, you know how to write and can take down what is said for
  your satisfaction. I can not; all I do is through the Great Spirit
  for the benefit of my women and children.

  My father, everything belongs to the Great Spirit. If he chooses
  to make the earth shake, or turn it over, all the skins, white and
  red, can not stop it. I have done. I trust to the Great Spirit.
  (_Ind. Off., 2._)

A few years later, in 1831, Catlin visited Känakûk, who was still
living with the remnant of his people in Illinois, and was then
regarded as their chief. He still preached the same doctrine, which
the artist incorrectly supposed was the Christian religion—probably
from the fact that the meetings were held on Sunday in imitation of
the whites—and especially was constantly and earnestly exhorting his
tribesmen to cease from drinking whisky, which threatened to destroy
their race. His influence had extended into Michigan, and many of the
Potawatomi were counted among his disciples. Catlin, who painted his
portrait (of which figure 60 is a reproduction), heard him preach, and
expressed surprise and admiration at the ease and grace of his manner
and his evident eloquent command of language. The traveler continues:

  I was singularly struck with the noble efforts of this champion
  of the mere remnant of a poisoned race so strenuously laboring to
  rescue the remainder of his people from the deadly bane that has
  been brought amongst them by enlightened Christians. How far the
  efforts of this zealous man have succeeded in Christianizing, I can
  not tell, but it is quite certain that his exemplary and constant
  endeavors have completely abolished the practice of drinking whisky
  in his tribe, which alone is a very praiseworthy achievement, and
  the first and indispensable step toward all other improvements. I
  was some time amongst those people, and was exceedingly pleased
  and surprised also to witness their sobriety and their peaceable
  conduct, not having seen an instance of drunkenness, or seen or
  heard of any use made of spirituous liquors whilst I was amongst
  the tribe. (_Catlin, 3._)

After mentioning, although apparently not crediting the assertion of
the traders, that the prophet had borrowed his doctrines from a white
man, Catlin goes on to describe a peculiar prayer-stick which Känakûk
had given to his followers, and which reminds us at once of the similar
device of the Delaware prophet of 1764, and is in line with the whole
system of birchbark pictographs among the northern tribes. These sticks
were of maple, graven with hieroglyphic prayers and other religious
symbols. They were carved by the prophet himself, who distributed them
to every family in the tribe, deriving quite a revenue from their sale,
and in this way increasing his influence both as a priest and as a man
of property. Apparently every man, woman, and child in the tribe was
at this time in the habit of reciting the prayers from these sticks on
rising in the morning and before retiring for the night. This was done
by placing the right index finger first under the upper character while
repeating a short prayer which it suggested, then under the next, and
the next, and so on to the bottom, the whole prayer, which was sung as
a sort of chant, occupying about ten minutes.

Without undertaking to pass judgement on the purity of the prophet’s
motives, Catlin strongly asserts that his influence and example were
good and had effectually turned his people from vice and dissipation
to temperance and industry, notwithstanding the debasing tendency of
association with a frontier white population.

The veteran missionary, Allis, also notes the use of this prayer
stick as he observed it in 1834 among the Kickapoo, then living near
Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas. The prophet’s followers were accustomed
to meet for worship on Sunday, when Känakûk delivered an exhortation
in their own language, after which they formed in line and marched
around several times in single file, reciting the chant from their
prayer-sticks and shaking hands with the bystanders as they passed.
As they departed they continued to chant until they arrived at the
“father’s house” or heaven, indicated by the figure of a horn at the
top of the prayer-stick. The worshipers met also on Fridays and made
confession of their sins, after which certain persons appointed for
the purpose gave each penitent several strokes with a rod of hickory,
according to the gravity of his offense. (_Allis, 1._)

[Illustration: +Fig. 62+—Onsawkie.]

Through the kindness of Mr C. H. Bartlett, of South Bend, Indiana, the
United States National Museum has recently come into possession of one
of these prayer-sticks. The stick, of which plate +LXXXVI+ gives a good
idea, is of maple, a little more than 12 inches in length, 2⁹⁄₁₆ inches
in its greatest width, and three-eighths of an inch thick. It is said
to have been painted a bright red on one side and a vivid green on the
other. The paint has now disappeared, however, leaving bare the
surface of the wood, polished from long use. One side is carved with
the symbolic figures already mentioned, while the other is smooth. In
all its details it is a neat specimen of Indian workmanship. According
to the tradition of the Armstrong family, its former owners, the small
square in the lower left-hand corner represents hell or the final
abode of the wicked, while the house with the four pine (?) trees, at
the top, symbolizes the spiritual home of the devout followers of the
prophet. As is well known, four is the sacred number of many Indian
tribes. The significance of several other lines above and below is
unknown. Along the shaft of the stick from bottom to top are the prayer
characters, arranged in three groups of five each, one group being near
the bottom, while the others are along the upper portion of the shaft
and are separated one from the other by a small circle. The characters
bear some resemblance to the old black-letter type of a missal, while
the peculiar arrangement is strongly suggestive of the Catholic rosary
with its fifteen “mysteries” in three groups of five each. It will be
remembered that the earliest and most constant missionaries among the
Kickapoo and other lake tribes were Catholic, and we may readily see
that their teachings and ceremonies influenced this native religion,
as was afterward the case with the religions of Smohalla and the
Ghost dance. Neither three nor five are commonly known as sacred
numbers among the Indians, while three is distinctly Christian in its
symbolism. It is perhaps superfluous to state that the ideas of heaven
and hell are not aboriginal, but were among the first incorporated from
the teachings of the white missionaries. The characters resembling
letters may be from the alphabetic system of sixteen characters which
it is said the Ojibwa invented for recording their own language, and
taught to the Kickapoo and Sauk, and which resembled somewhat the
letters of the Roman alphabet, from which they apparently were derived.
(_Hamilton, 1._)

[Illustration: PL. LXXXVI

  THE PRAYER-STICK]

This prayer-stick or “bible,” as it has been called, was obtained by
Mr Bartlett from Mr R.V. Armstrong, of Mill Creek, Indiana, who stated
that it was the only remaining one of a large number which had been
in possession of the family for many years. The story of the manner
in which it was originally obtained, as told by Mr Armstrong, is
interesting. “His father, Reverend James Armstrong, was a Methodist
minister and missionary who had been sent to northern Indiana in the
early part of this century. In 1830, while living on Shawnee prairie,
3 miles from the present site of Attica, Indiana, a large band of
Kickapoo Indians came to his house to visit the missionary, and
apparently regarded the interview as of great importance to themselves.
They declared that they were from beyond the Mississippi river, that
they had heard of Mr Armstrong and his missionary labors, and that they
believed him to be the one for whom their people had long been looking.
Each Indian held in his hand one of these wooden crosses, and as they
knelt on the grass in front of the missionary’s house, they went
through their devotions in their own tongue, moving their fingers over
the inscription that ascends the shaft of the cross. The missionary
understood them to state that this cross was their “bible,” that they
knew that it was not the true bible, but that they had been told to use
it until one should come who would give them in exchange the genuine
word of God. Thereupon the missionary gathered up their crosses—and
there were more than a large basketful of them—and gave in exchange to
each a copy of the New Testament. The Indians received the books with
profuse expressions of gratitude and apparently viewed them at once
as sacred possessions. These wise men from the west then went away to
their far country.”

Känakûk died of smallpox in 1852, in Kansas, where his people had been
removed in spite of his eloquent appeals in their behalf. For many
years he had been recognized as the chief of his tribe, and as such
exerted a most beneficial influence over the Kickapoo in restraining
the introduction and use of liquor among them. At the same time he
staunchly upheld the old Indian idea and resisted every advance of the
missionaries and civilization to the last. He was regarded as possessed
of supernatural powers, and in his last illness asserted that he would
arise again three days after death. In expectation of the fulfillment
of the prophecy, a number of his followers remained watching near the
corpse until they too contracted the contagion and died likewise.
(_Comr., 1._) After his death, the decline of his tribe was rapid and
without check. In 1894 there remained only 514, about equally divided
between Kansas and Oklahoma. These few survivors of a large tribe still
hold in loving reverence the name of their chief and prophet.


                               PA′THĔSKĔ

Recent personal investigation among the Winnebago failed to develop
any knowledge of a former doctrine of an approaching destruction of
the world, as mentioned in a statement already quoted (see page 661).
It appeared, however, that at the time indicated, about 1852 or 1853,
while the tribe was still living on Turkey river, Iowa, a prophet known
as Pa′thĕskĕ, or Long Nose, announced that he had been instructed in a
vision to teach his people a new dance, which he called the friendship
dance (chû′‘korăki′). This they were to perform at intervals for one
whole year, at the end of which time, in the spring, they must take
the warpath against their hereditary enemy, the Sioux, and would then
reap a rich harvest of scalps. The dance, as he taught it to them, he
claimed to have seen performed by a band of spirits in the other world,
whither he had been taken after a ceremonial fast of several days’
duration. It differed from their other dances, and, although warlike
in its ultimate purpose, was not a war dance. It was performed by the
men alone, circling around a fire within the lodge. He also designated
a young man named Sara′minûka, or “Indistinct,” as the proper one
to lead the expedition at the appointed time. The friendship dance
went on all through the summer and winter until spring, when the
prophet announced that he had received a new revelation forbidding the
proposed expedition. His disgusted followers at once denounced him as
an impostor and abandoned the dance. Sara′minûka was soon afterward
killed by an accident, which was considered by the Indians a direct
retribution for his failure to carry out his part of the program. The
prophet died a few years later while on a visit to Washington with a
delegation of his tribe.

Although the old men consulted on the subject seemed to know nothing
of any predicted destruction of the world in this connection, it is
probable that the statement given by Agent Fletcher at the time was
correct, as such cycle myths are very general among the Indian and
other primitive tribes. The Arapaho informed the author that we are now
living in the sixth cycle, and that the final catastrophe will take

                                TÄ′VIBO

About 1870 another prophet arose among the Paiute in Nevada. As most
Indian movements are unknown to the whites at their inception, the date
is variously put from 1869 to 1872. He is said to have been the father
of the present “messiah,” who has unquestionably derived many of his
ideas from him, and lived, as does his son, in Mason valley, about 60
miles south of Virginia City, not far from Walker River reservation.
In talking with his son, he said that his father’s name was Tä′vibo
or “White man,” and that he was a _capita_ (Spanish, _capitan_) or
petty chief, but not a prophet or preacher, although he used to have
visions and was invulnerable. From concurrent testimony of Indians and
white men, however, there seems to be no doubt that he did preach and
prophesy and introduce a new religious dance among his people, and
that the doctrine which he promulgated and the hopes which he held out
twenty years ago were the foundation on which his son has built the
structure of the present messiah religion. He was visited by Indians
from Oregon and Idaho, and his teachings made their influence felt
among the Bannock and Shoshoni, as well as among all the scattered
bands of the Paiute, to whom he continued to preach until his death a
year or two later. (_G. D., 1 and 2; A. G. O., 1; Phister, 1._)

Captain J. M. Lee, Ninth infantry, formerly on the staff of General
Miles, was on duty in that neighborhood at the time and gives the
following account of the prophet and his doctrines in a personal letter
to the author:

  I was on Indian duty in Nevada in 1869, 1870, and 1871. When
  visiting Walker Lake reservation in 1869–70, I became acquainted
  with several superstitious beliefs then prevailing among the
  Paiute Indians. It was a rough, mountainous region roundabout, and
  mysterious happenings, according to tradition, always occurred when
  the prophet or medicine-men went up into the mountains and there
  received their revelations from the divine spirits. In the earlier
  part of the sixties the whites began to come in and appropriate
  much of the Indian country in Nevada, and in the usual course it
  turned out that the medicine-men or prophets were looked to for
  relief. The most influential went up alone into the mountain and
  there met the Great Spirit. He brought back with him no tablets of
  stone, but he was a messenger of good tidings to the effect that
  within a few moons there was to be a great upheaval or earthquake.
  All the improvements of the whites—all their houses, their goods,
  stores, etc.—would remain, but the whites would be swallowed up,
  while the Indians would be saved and permitted to enjoy the earth
  and all the fullness thereof, including anything left by the wicked
  whites. This revelation was duly proclaimed by the prophet, and
  attracted a few believers, but the doubting skeptics were too many,
  and they ridiculed the idea that the white men would fall into
  the holes and be swallowed up while the Indians would not. As the
  prophet could not enforce his belief, he went up into the mountain
  again and came back with a second revelation, which was that when
  the great disaster came, all, both Indians and whites, would be
  swallowed up or overwhelmed, but that at the end of three days (or
  a few days) the Indians would be resurrected in the flesh, and
  would live forever to enjoy the earth, with plenty of game, fish,
  and pine nuts, while their enemies, the whites, would be destroyed
  forever. There would thus be a final and eternal separation between
  Indians and whites.

  This revelation, which seemed more reasonable, was rather popular
  for awhile, but as time wore along faith seemed to weaken and the
  prophet was without honor even in his own country. After much
  fasting and prayer, he made a third trip to the mountain, where he
  secured a final revelation or message to the people. The divine
  spirit had become so much incensed at the lack of faith in the
  prophecies, that it was revealed to his chosen one that those
  Indians who believed in the prophecy would be resurrected and be
  happy, but those who did not believe in it would stay in the ground
  and be damned forever with the whites.

  It was not long after this that the prophet died, and the poor
  miserable Indians worried along for nearly two decades, eating
  grasshoppers, lizards, and fish, and trying to be civilized until
  the appearance of this new prophet Quoit-tsow, who is said to be
  the son, either actual or spiritual, of the first one.

Additional details are given in the following interesting extract
from a letter addressed to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under
date of November 19, 1890, by Mr Frank Campbell, who has an intimate
acquaintance with the tribe and was employed in an official capacity
on the reservation at the time when Tävibo first announced the new
revelation. It would appear from Mr Campbell’s statement that under
the new dispensation both races were to meet on a common level, and,
as this agrees with what Professor Thompson, referred to later on,
afterward found among the eastern Paiute, it is probable that the
original doctrine had been very considerably modified since its first
promulgation a few years before.

  Eighteen years ago I was resident farmer on Walker Lake Indian
  reserve, Nevada. I had previously been connected with the Indian
  service at the reserve for ten years, was familiar with the Paiute
  customs, and personally acquainted with all the Indians in that
  region. In 1872 an Indian commenced preaching a new religion at
  that reserve that caused a profound sensation among the Paiute.
  For several months I was kept in ignorance of the cause of the
  excitement—which was remarkable, considering the confidence they
  had always reposed in me. They no doubt expected me to ridicule the
  sayings of the new messiah, as I had always labored among them to
  break down, their superstitious beliefs. When finally I was made
  acquainted with, the true facts of the case, I told them, the
  preachings of Waugh-zee-waugh-ber were good and no harm could come
  from it. Indian emissaries visited the reserve from Idaho, Oregon,
  and other places, to investigate the new religion. I visited the
  Indian camp while the prophet was in a trance and remained until
  he came to. In accordance with instructions, the Indians gathered
  around him and joined in a song that was to guide the spirit back
  to the body. Upon reanimation he gave a long account of his visit
  in the spirit to the Supreme Ruler, who was then on the way with
  all the spirits of the departed dead to again reside upon this
  earth and change it into a paradise. Life was to be eternal, and no
  distinction was to exist between races.

  This morning’s press dispatches contain an account of Porcupine’s
  visit to Walker lake ... that proves to me that the religion
  started at Walker lake eighteen years ago is the same that is now
  agitating the Indian world. There is nothing in it to cause trouble
  between whites and Indians unless the new Messiah is misquoted and
  his doctrine misconstrued. I left Walker Lake reserve in June,
  1873, and at the time supposed this craze would die out, but have
  several times since been reminded by Nevada papers and letters that
  it was gradually spreading. (_G. D., 3._)

The name given by Campbell certainly does not much resemble Tävibo, but
it is quite possible that the father, like the son, had more than one
name. It is also possible that “Waughzeewaughber” was not the prophet
described by Captain Lee, but one of his disciples who had taken up
and modified the original doctrine. The name Tävibo refers to the east
(_tävänagwat_) or place where the sun (_täbi_) rises. By the cognate
Shoshoni and Comanche the whites are called _Taivo_.

From oral information of Professor A. H. Thompson, of the United States
Geological Survey, I learn some particulars of the advent of the new
doctrine among the Paiute of southwestern Utah. While his party was
engaged in that section in the spring of 1875, a great excitement was
caused among the Indians by the report that two mysterious beings
with white skins (it will be remembered that the father of Wovoka was
named Tävibo or “white man”) had appeared among the Paiute far to the
west and announced a speedy resurrection of all the dead Indians, the
restoration of the game, and the return of the old-time primitive life.
Under the new order of things, moreover, both races alike were to be
white. A number of Indians from Utah went over into Nevada, where they
met others who claimed to have seen these mysterious visitors farther
in the west. On their return to Utah they brought back with them the
ceremonial of the new belief, the chief part of the ritual being a
dance performed at night in a circle, with no fire in the center, very
much as in the modern Ghost dance.

It is said that the Mormons, who hold the theory that the Indians are
the descendants of the supposititious “ten lost tribes,” cherish, as
a part of their faith, the tradition that some of the lost Hebrew
emigrants are still ice-bound in the frozen north, whence they will one
day emerge to rejoin their brethren in the south. When the news of this
Indian revelation came to their ears, the Mormon priests accepted it
as a prophecy of speedy fulfillment of their own traditions, and Orson
Pratt, one of the most prominent leaders, preached a sermon, which was
extensively copied and commented on at the time, urging the faithful
to arrange their affairs and put their houses in order to receive the
long-awaited wanderers.

According to the statement of the agent then in charge at Fort Hall,
in Idaho, the Mormons at the same time—the early spring of 1875—sent
emissaries to the Bannock, urging them to go to Salt Lake City to
be baptized into the Mormon religion. A large number accepted the
invitation without the knowledge of the agent, went down to Utah, and
were there baptized, and then returned to work as missionaries of the
new faith among their tribes. As an additional inducement, free rations
were furnished by the Mormons to all who would come and be baptized,
and “they were told that by being baptized and going to church the old
men would all become young, the young men would never be sick, that the
Lord had a work for them to do, and that they were the chosen people of
God to establish his kingdom upon the earth,” etc. It is also asserted
that they were encouraged to resist the authority of the government.
(_Comr., 2._) However much of truth there may be in these reports,
and we must make considerable allowance for local prejudice, it is
sufficiently evident that the Mormons took an active interest in the
religious ferment then existing among the neighboring tribes and helped
to give shape to the doctrine which crystallized some years later in
the Ghost dance.


                            NAKAI′-DOKLĬ′NI

[Illustration: +Fig. 63+—Nakai′-doklĭ′ni’s dance-wheel.]

Various other prophets of more or less local celebrity have arisen from
time to time among the tribes, and the resurrection of the dead and the
return of the olden things have usually figured prominently in their
prophecies. In fact, this idea has probably been the day-dream of every
Indian medicine-man since the whites first landed in America. Most of
these, however, have been unknown to fame outside of their own narrow
circles, except where chance or deliberate purpose has given a warlike
meaning to their teachings and thus made them the subjects of official
notice.

Among these may be mentioned the Apache medicine-man Nakai′-doklĭ′ni,
who attracted some attention for a time in southern Arizona in 1881.
(_Bourke, 1._) In the early part of this year he began to advertise his
supernatural powers, claiming to be able to raise the dead and commune
with spirits, and predicting that the whites would soon be driven from
the land. He taught his followers a new and peculiar dance, in which
the performers were ranged like the spokes of a wheel, all facing
inward, while he, standing in the center, sprinkled them with the
sacred _hoddentin_[3] as they circled around him.

In June of 1881 he announced to his people, the White Mountain band
of Apache on San Carlos reservation, that on condition of receiving
a sufficient number of horses and blankets for his trouble he would
bring back from the dead two chiefs who had been killed a few months
before. The proposition naturally aroused great excitement among the
Indians. Eager to have once more with them their beloved chiefs, they
willingly produced the required ponies, and when remonstrated with by
the agent, replied that they would wait until the specified time for
the fulfillment of the prediction, when, if the dead chiefs failed
to materialize, they would demand the restoration of the property.
(_Comr., 3._)

Accordingly Nakai′-doklĭ′ni began his prayers and ceremonies, and the
dance was kept up regularly at his camp on Cibicu creek until August,
when it was reported to Colonel E. A. Carr; commanding at Fort Apache,
that the medicine-man had announced that the dead chiefs refused to
return because of the presence of the whites, but that when the whites
left, the dead would return, and that the whites would be out of the
country when the corn was ripe.

As matters seemed to be getting serious, the agent now called on the
commanding officer to “arrest or kill him, or both.” The officer
prepared to make the arrest when Nakai′-doklĭ′ni should come down to
the post to lead the dance which had been arranged to take place in
a few days. The prophet failed to put in an appearance, however, and
messengers were sent to his camp to ask him to come to the fort the
next Sunday. To this message he returned an evasive reply, whereon
Colonel Carr, with 85 white troops and 23 Apache scouts, started for
his camp in Cibicu canyon to put him under arrest. They arrived at the
village on August 30. Nakai′-doklĭ′ni submitted quietly to arrest, but
as the troops were making camp for the night, their own scouts, joined
by others of the Indians, opened fire on them. A sharp skirmish ensued,
in which several soldiers were killed or wounded, but the Indians were
repulsed with considerable loss, including the prophet himself, who was
killed at the first fire. The result was another in the long series of
Apache outbreaks. (_Comr., 4; Sec. War, 1; A. G. O., 2._)


                        THE POTAWATOMI PROPHET

In 1883 a new religion was introduced among the Potawatomi and
Kickapoo, of the Pottawotomie and Great Nemaha agency in northeastern
Kansas, by visiting Potawatomi, Winnebago, and Ojibwa from Wisconsin.
As usual, the ritual part consists chiefly of a ceremonial dance. In
doctrine it teaches the same code of morality enjoined by the ten
commandments, and especially prohibits liquor drinking, gambling, and
horse racing, for which, reason the agents generally have not seen fit
to interfere with it, and in some cases have rather encouraged it as a
civilizing influence among that portion of the tribes not yet enrolled
in Christian denominations. The movement is entirely distinct from
the Ghost dance, and may perhaps be a revival of the system preached
by Känakûk more than fifty years before. In 1891 the majority of the
two tribes, numbering in all 749, were reported as adherents of the
doctrine. (_Comr., 5, 6, 7; also reports from the same agency for
1887 and 1889._) A large number of the Sauk and Fox, Kickapoo, and
Potawatomi of Oklahoma are also believers in the religion.

In 1885 Agent Patrick says on this subject:

  These Indians are chaste, cleanly, and industrious, and would be
  a valuable acquisition to the Prairie band if it were not for
  their intense devotion to a religious dance started among the
  northern Indians some years since. This dance was introduced to the
  Prairie band about two years ago by the Absentee Pottawatomies and
  Winnebagoes, and has spread throughout the tribes in the agency.
  They seem to have adopted the religion as a means of expressing
  their belief in the justice and mercy of the Great Spirit and of
  their devotion to him, and are so earnest in their convictions
  as to its affording them eternal happiness that I have thought
  it impolitic so far to interfere with it any further than to
  advise as few meetings as possible and to discountenance it in my
  intercourse with the individuals practicing the religion. It is not
  an unmixed evil, as under its teaching drunkenness and gambling
  have been reduced 75 per cent, and a departure from virtue on the
  part of its members meets with the severest condemnation. As some
  tenets of revealed religion are embraced in its doctrines, I do not
  consider it a backward step for the Indians who have not heretofore
  professed belief in any Christian religion, and believe its worst
  features are summed up in the loss of time it occasions and the
  fanatical train of thought involved in the constant contemplation
  of the subject. (_Comr., 6._)


                   CHEEZ-TAH-PAEZH THE SWORD-BEARER

It is probable that something of the messiah idea entered into
the promises held out to his followers by Sword-bearer, a Crow
medicine-man, in Montana in 1887. The official records are silent on
this point, although it is definitely stated that he asserted his own
invulnerability, and that his claims in this respect were implicitly
believed by his people. Cheez-tah-paezh, literally “Wraps his tail”
(also written Cheeschapahdisch, Cheschopah, Chese-cha-pahdish, and
Chese-Topah), was without any special prominence in his tribe until the
summer of 1887, when, in company with several other young men of the
Crows, he participated in the sun dance of the Cheyenne, and showed
such fortitude in enduring the dreadful torture that he was presented
by the Cheyenne with a medicine saber painted red, in virtue of which
he took the title of Sword-bearer. This naturally brought him into
notice at home, and he soon aspired to become a chief and medicine-man.
Among other things, he asserted that no bullet or weapon had power
to harm him. What other claims he made are not known, but his words
produced such an impression, it is said, that for a time every
full-blood and half-blood among the Crows believed in him.

In a few months he had become one of the most influential leaders
in the tribe, when, taking advantage of some dissatisfaction toward
the agent, he headed a demonstration against the agency on September
30. Troops under General Ruger were called on to arrest him and the
others concerned, and in attempting to do this, on November 5, 1887, a
skirmish ensued in which Sword-bearer was killed. His death convinced
his followers of the falsehood of his pretensions, and the tribe, which
hitherto had always been loyal to the government, soon resumed its
friendly attitude. (_Sec. War, 2; A. G. O., 3; additional details from
a personal letter by Colonel Simon Snyder, Fifteenth infantry._)

The action is graphically described by Roosevelt on the authority of
one of the officers engaged. When the troops arrived, they found the
Crow warriors awaiting them on a hill, mounted on their war ponies and
in full paint and buckskin. In this author’s words—

  The Crows on the hilltop showed a sullen and threatening front,
  and the troops advanced slowly toward them, and then halted for a
  parley. Meanwhile a mass of black thunder clouds gathering on the
  horizon threatened one of those cloudbursts of extreme severity and
  suddenness so characteristic of the plains country. While still
  trying to make arrangements for a parley, a horseman started out of
  the Crow ranks and galloped headlong down toward the troops. It was
  the medicine chief Sword-bearer. He was painted and in his battle
  dress, wearing his war bonnet of floating, trailing eagle feathers,
  and with the plumes of the same bird braided in the mane and tail
  of his fiery little horse. On he came at a gallop almost up to the
  troops, and then began to circle around them, calling and singing,
  and throwing his red sword into the air, catching it by the hilt
  as it fell. Twice he rode completely around the troops, who stood
  in uncertainty, not knowing what to make of his performance, and
  expressly forbidden to shoot at him. Then, paying no further heed
  to them, he rode back toward the Crows. It appears that he had
  told the latter that he would ride twice around the hostile force,
  and by his incantations would call down rain from heaven, which
  would make the hearts of the white men like water, so that they
  would go back to their homes. Sure enough, while the arrangements
  for the parley were still going forward, down came the cloudburst,
  drenching the command, and making the ground on the hills in front
  nearly impassable; and before it dried a courier arrived with
  orders to the troops to go back to camp.

  This fulfillment of Sword-bearer’s prophecy of course raised his
  reputation to the zenith, and the young men of the tribe prepared
  for war, while the older chiefs, who more fully realized the power
  of the whites, still hung back. When the troops next appeared, they
  came upon the entire Crow force, the women and children with their
  tepees being off to one side beyond a little stream, while almost
  all the warriors of the tribe were gathered in front. Sword-bearer
  started to repeat his former ride, to the intense irritation of the
  soldiers. Luckily, however, this time some of his young men could
  not be restrained. They, too, began to ride near the troops, and
  one of them was unable to refrain from firing on Captain Edwards’s
  troop, which was in the van. This gave the soldiers their chance.
  They instantly responded with a volley, and Edwards’s troop
  charged. The fight lasted only a minute or two, for Sword-bearer
  was struck by a bullet and fell; and as he had boasted himself
  invulnerable and promised that his warriors should be invulnerable
  also if they would follow him, the hearts of the latter became as
  water, and they broke in every direction. (_Roosevelt, 1._)




                             +Chapter VI+

             THE SMOHALLA RELIGION OF THE COLUMBIA REGION

                               SMOHALLA

  I have only one heart. Although you say, Go to another country, my
  heart is not that way. I do not want money for my land. I am here,
  and here is where I am going to be. I will not part with lands, and
  if you come again I will say the same thing. I will not part with
  my lands.—_Umatilla Chief._

  We have never made any trade. The earth is part of my body, and I
  never gave up the earth. So long as the earth keeps me I want to be
  let alone.—_Toohulhulsote._

  Their only troubles arise from the attempts of white men to
  encroach upon the reservations. I verily believe that were the
  snow-crowned summits of Mount Rainier set apart as an Indian
  reservation, white men would immediately commence jumping
  them.—_Superintendent Ross._

About the time that the Paiute were preparing for the millennial
dawn, we begin to hear of a “dreamer prophet” on the Columbia, called
Smohalla, who was becoming a thorn in the flesh of the Indian agents
in that quarter, and was reported to be organizing among the Indians a
new religion which taught the destruction of the whites and resistance
to the government, and made moral virtues of all the crimes in the
catalog. One agent, in disregard of grammar if not of veracity,
gravely reported that “the main object is to allow a plurality of
wives, immunity from punishment for lawbreaking, and allowance of all
the vices—especially drinking and gambling—are chief virtues in the
believers of this religion.” (_Comr., 8._)

This was bad enough, but worse was behind it. It appeared that Smohalla
and his followers, numbering perhaps about 2,000 Indians of various
tribes along the Columbia in eastern Washington and Oregon, had never
made treaties giving up any of their lands, and consequently claimed
the right to take salmon in the streams and dig kamas in the prairies
of their ancestral country undisturbed and unmolested, and stoutly
objected to going on any of the neighboring reservations at Yakima,
Umatilla, or Warmspring. There is no doubt that justice and common
sense were on the side of the Indians, for by the reports of the agents
themselves it is shown that the dwellers on the reservations were
generally neglected, poor, and miserable, and subjected to constant
encroachments by the whites in spite of treaties and treaty lines,
while at the same time that agents and superintendents were invoking
the aid of the military to compel Smohalla’s followers to go on a
reservation these same men were moving heaven and earth to force the
Indians already on a reservation to give up their treaty rights and
remove to another and less valuable location—to begin life anew under
the fostering care of the government until such time as the white man
should want them to move on again.

These matters are treated at length in the annual reports of the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, with the accompanying reports of
superintendents and agents in charge of the reservations concerned,
from 1870 to 1875. With regard to the Umatilla reservation, to which
most strenuous efforts were made to remove the “renegades,” as they
were called, Agent Boyle reports in 1870 (_Comr., 9_) that the Indians
are “dispirited ... in consequence of the oft-repeated theme that their
farms are to be taken from them and given to the white settlers.” He
continues, “It is hardly to be expected that the Indians can retain
this reservation much longer unless the strong arm of the government
protects them. Daily I am called upon to notify the white settlers that
they are encroaching upon the Indian lands.” He advises their removal
to a permanent reservation, “knowing as I do that they must go sooner
or later.” Again, “The agency has been established for the space of
ten years, and I regret exceedingly that I have been most completely
disappointed with what I see about me.” In discussing the removal of
the Indians to a new reservation, Superintendent Meacham says of a
considerable portion of them that it “would suit them better to be
turned loose to look out for themselves.” (_Comr., 10._)

In 1873 Agent Cornoyer reported that the Indians numbered 837, by the
census of 1870, which he believes was as correct as could then be
taken, but “this number I think is now too high.” He continues:

  Of the appropriation of $4,000 per annum for beneficial objects,
  not one single dollar of that fund has been turned over to me since
  September, 1871; and of the appropriation for incidental expenses
  of $40,000 per annum for the Indian service in this state, only
  $200 of that appropriation has been turned over to me during the
  same period of two years.... I would also beg leave to call your
  attention to that portion of my last annual report wherein I called
  the attention of the Department to the unfulfilled stipulations of
  the treaty of June 9, 1855, with these Indians. (_Comr., 11._)

Commissioner Brunot, in 1871, stated that the estimated number of
Indians coming under the provisions of the treaty at the time it was
made in 1855 was 3,500, and “by the census taken in 1870 the number was
1,622”—a decrease of nearly one-half in fifteen years. Of these only
about half were on the reservation, the rest being on Columbia river,
“never having partaken of the benefits of the treaty.” On the next page
he tells us what some of these benefits are: “Maladministration of
agents, and the misapplication of funds, the failure of the government
to perform the promises of the treaty, and the fact that the Indians
have been constantly agitated by assertions that the government
intended their removal, and that their removal was urged for several
years in succession in the reports of a former agent, thus taking away
from them all incentives to improve their lands.” (_Comr., 12._)

In 1871 a commission was sent to Umatilla and other reservations, which
gave the Indians a chance to speak for themselves. The Cayuse chief,
described as a Catholic Indian, in dress, personal appearance, and
bearing superior to the average American farmer, said:

  This reservation is marked out for us. We see it with our eyes
  and our hearts. We all hold it with our bodies and our souls.
  Right out here are my father and mother, and brothers and sisters
  and children, all buried. I am guarding their graves. My friend,
  this reservation, this small piece of land, we look upon it as
  our mother, as if she were raising us. You come to ask me for my
  land. It is like as if we who are Indians were to be sent away and
  get lost.... What is the reason you white men who live near the
  reservation like my land and want to get it? You must not think so.
  My friends, you must not talk too strong about getting my land. I
  like my land and will not let it go.

The Wallawalla chief said:

  I have tied all the reservation in my heart and it can not be
  loosened. It is dear as our bodies to us.

The Umatilla chief said:

  Our red people were brought up here.... When my father and mother
  died, I was left here. They gave me rules and gave me their land
  to live upon. They left me to take care of them after they were
  buried. I was to watch over their graves. I do not wish to part
  with my land. I have felt tired working on my land, so tired
  that the sweat dropped off me on the ground. Where is all that
  Governor Stevens or General Palmer said [i. e., that it was to be a
  reservation for the Indians forever]? I am very fond of this land
  that is marked out for me.... Should I take only a small piece of
  ground and a white man sit down beside me, I fear there would be
  trouble all the time.

An old man said:

  I am getting old now, and I want to die where my father and mother
  and children have died. I do not wish to leave this land and go
  off to some other land.... I see where I have sweat and worked in
  trying to get food. I love my church, my mills, my farm, the graves
  of my parents and children. I do not wish to leave my land. That is
  all my heart, and I show it to you.

A young chief said:

  I have only one heart, one tongue. Although you say, Go to another
  country, my heart is not that way. I do not wish for any money for
  my land. I am here, and here is where I am going to be.... I will
  not part with lands, and if you come again I will say the same
  thing. I will not part with my lands.

The commissioner who was conducting the negotiations, after enumerating
the promises made to the Indians in return for the lands which they had
surrendered under the original treaty of 1855, tells how some of these
promises have been fulfilled:

  ... A miserably inadequate supply of worn-out agricultural
  implements. A group of eight or ten dilapidated shanties used for
  the agency buildings. The physician promised has never resided
  upon the reservation, but lives and practices his profession at
  Pendleton. The hospital promised (fifteen years ago) has not yet
  been erected.

Of their ever-living grievance Colonel Ross, superintendent of the
Washington agencies, says:

  Their only troubles arise from the attempts of white men to
  encroach upon the reservations. A mania prevails among a certain
  class of citizens in this direction. I verily believe that were
  the snow-crowned summits of Mount Rainier set apart as an Indian
  reservation, white men would immediately commence jumping them.
  (_Comr., 14._)


                     JOSEPH AND THE NEZ PERCÉ WAR

We first hear officially of Smohalla and his people from A. B. Meacham,
superintendent of Indian affairs in Oregon, who states, in September,
1870, that—

  ... One serious drawback [to the adoption of the white man’s road]
  is the existence among the Indians of Oregon of a peculiar religion
  called Smokeller or Dreamers, the chief doctrine of which is that
  the red man is again to rule the country, and this sometimes leads
  to rebellion against lawful authority.

A few pages farther on we learn the nature of this rebellion:

  The next largest band (not on a reservation) is Smokeller’s, at
  Priest rapids, Washington territory. They also refused to obey my
  order to come in, made to them during the month of February last,
  of which full report was made. I would also recommend that they be
  removed to Umatilla by the military. (_Comr., 15._)

Three months before this report Congress had passed a bill appointing
commissioners to negotiate with the tribes of Umatilla reservation “to
ascertain upon what terms they would be willing to sell their lands and
remove elsewhere,” and Meacham himself was the principal member of this
commission. (_Comr., 15._)

In 1872 Smohalla’s followers along the Columbia were reported to number
2,000, and his apostles were represented as constantly traveling from
one reservation to another to win over new converts to his teachings.
Repeated efforts had been made to induce them to go on the reservations
in eastern Oregon and Washington, but without success. We are told now
that—

  They have a new and peculiar religion, by the doctrines of which
  they are taught that a new god is coming to their rescue; that all
  the Indians who have died heretofore, and who shall die hereafter,
  are to be resurrected; that as they will then be very numerous and
  powerful, they will be able to conquer the whites, recover their
  lands, and live as free and unrestrained as their fathers lived
  in olden times. Their model of a man is an Indian. They aspire to
  be Indians and nothing else.... It is thought by those who know
  them best that they can not be made to go upon their reservations
  without at least being intimidated by the presence of a military
  force. (_Comr., 17._)

We hear but little more of Smohalla and his doctrines for several
years, until attention was again attracted to Indian affairs in the
northwest by the growing dissatisfaction which culminated in the Nez
Percé war of 1877. The Nez Percés, especially those who acknowledged
the leadership of Chief Joseph, were largely under the influence of
the Dreamer prophets, and there was reason to believe that an uprising
inaugurated by so prominent a tribe would involve all the smaller
tribes in sympathy with the general Indian belief. As soon therefore
as it became evident that matters were approaching a crisis, a
commission, of which General O. O. Howard was chief, was appointed to
make some peaceable arrangement with the so-called “renegades” on the
upper Columbia. The commissioners met Smohalla and his principal men
at Wallula, Washington territory, on April 23, 1877, and as a result
of the council then held these non-treaty tribes, although insisting
as strongly as ever on their right to live undisturbed in their own
country, yet refrained from taking part in the war which broke out a
few weeks later.

It is foreign to our purpose to recount the history of the Nez
Percé war of 1877. As is generally the case with Indian wars, it
originated in the unauthorized intrusion of lawless whites on lands
which the Indians claimed as theirs by virtue of occupancy from time
immemorial. The Nez Percés, whom all authorities agree in representing
as a superior tribe of Indians, originally inhabited the valleys of
Clearwater and Salmon rivers in Idaho, with the country extending
west of Snake river into Washington and Oregon as far as the Blue
mountains. They are first officially noticed in the report of the
Indian Commissioner for 1843, where they are described as “noble,
industrious, sensible,” and well disposed toward the whites, while
“though brave as Cæsar, the whites have nothing to dread at their hands
in case of their dealing out to them what they conceive to be right
and equitable.” (_Comr., 18._) It being deemed advisable to bring them
into more direct relations with the United States, the agent who made
the report called the chiefs together in this year and “assured them
of the kind intentions of our government, and of the sad consequences
that would ensue to any white man, from this time, who should invade
their rights.” (_Comr., 19._) On the strength of these fair promises
a portion of the tribe, in 1855, entered into a treaty by which they
ceded a large part of their territory, and were guaranteed possession
of the rest. In 1860, however, gold was discovered in the country,
and the usual result followed. “In defiance of law, and despite the
protestations of the Indian agent, a townsite was laid off in October,
1861, on the reservation, and Lewiston, with a population of 1,200,
sprung into existence.” (_Comr., 20._) A new treaty was then made
in 1863, by which the intruders were secured in possession of what
they had thus seized, and the Nez Percés were restricted within much
narrower limits. By this treaty the Wallowa valley, in northeastern
Oregon, the ancestral home of that part of the tribe under the
leadership of Chief Joseph, was taken from the Indians. This portion
of the tribe, however, had refused to have part in the negotiations,
and “Chief Joseph and his band, utterly ignoring the treaty of 1863,
continued to claim the Wallowa valley, where he was tacitly permitted
to roam without restraint, until the encroachments of white settlers
induced the government to take some definite action respecting this
band of non-treaty Nez Percés.” (_Comr., 21._) At this time the tribe
numbered about 2,800, of whom about 500 acknowledged Joseph as their
chief.

[Illustration: PL. LXXXVII

  CHIEF JOSEPH]

Collisions between the whites and Indians in the valley became more
frequent, and one of Joseph’s band had been killed, when a commission
was appointed in 1876 to induce the Indians to give up the Wallowa
valley and remove to Lapwai reservation in Idaho. Joseph still
refusing to remove, the matter was turned over to General Howard. On
May 3, 1877, he held the first council with Joseph and his followers at
Fort Lapwai. Their ceremonial approach, which was probably in accord
with the ritual teachings of the Dreamer religion, is thus described by
the general:

  A long rank of men, followed by women and children, with
  faces painted, the red paint extending back into the partings
  of the hair—the men’s hair braided and tied up with showy
  strings—ornamented in dress, in hats, in blankets with variegated
  colors, in leggings of buckskin and moccasins beaded and plain;
  women with bright shawls or blankets, and skirts to the ankle and
  top moccasins. All were mounted on Indian ponies as various in
  color as the dress of the riders. These picturesque people, after
  keeping us waiting long enough for effect, came in sight from up
  the valley from the direction of their temporary camp just above
  the company gardens. They drew near to the hollow square of the
  post and in front of the small company to be interviewed. Then
  they struck up their song. They were not armed except with a few
  tomahawk pipes that could be smoked with the peaceful tobacco or
  penetrate the skull bone of an enemy, at the will of the holder.
  Yet somehow this wild sound produced a strange effect. It made one
  feel glad that there were but fifty of them, and not five hundred.
  It was shrill and searching; sad, like a wail, and yet defiant in
  its close. The Indians swept around outside the fence and made
  the entire circuit, still keeping up the song as they rode. The
  buildings broke the refrain into irregular bubblings of sound until
  the ceremony was completed. (_Howard, 1._)

At this conference Toohulhulsote, the principal Dreamer priest of
Joseph’s band, acted as spokesman for the Indians, and insisted,
according to the Smohalla doctrine, that the earth was his mother, that
she should not be disturbed by hoe or plow, that men should subsist by
the spontaneous productions of nature, and that the sovereignty of the
earth could not be sold or given away. Continuing, he asserted, “We
never have made any trade. Part of the Indians gave up their land. I
never did. The earth is part of my body, and I never gave up the earth.
So long as the earth keeps me I want to be left alone.” General Howard
finally ordered him under arrest, after which the Indians at last
agreed to go on a reservation by June 14. (_Howard, 2._) A few days
later, councils were held with Smohalla and his people, and with Moses,
another noted “renegade” chief with a considerable following farther
up the Columbia. Both chiefs, representing at least 500 warriors,
disclaimed any hostile intentions and agreed to go on reservations.
Smohalla said, “Your law is my law. I say to you, yes. I will be on
a reservation by September.” (_Howard, 3._) Parties under Joseph and
other leading chiefs then went out to select suitable locations for
reservations, Joseph and his band deciding in favor of Lapwai valley.
Everything was moving smoothly toward a speedy and peaceful settlement
of all difficulties, and the commission had already reported the
successful accomplishment of the work, when a single act of lawless
violence undid the labor of weeks and precipitated a bloody war.
(_Comr., 22._)

One of Joseph’s band had been murdered by whites some time before,
but the Indians had remained quiet. (_Comr., 23._) Now, while the Nez
Percés were gathering up their stock to remove to the reservation
selected, a band of white robbers attacked them, ran off the cattle,
and killed one of the party in charge. Joseph could no longer restrain
his warriors, and on June 13, 1877—one day before the date that had
been appointed for going on the reservation—the enraged Nez Percés
attacked the neighboring settlement on White Bird creek, Idaho, and
killed 21 persons.[4] The war was begun. The troops under Howard were
ordered out. The first fight occurred on June 17 at Hangman’s creek
and resulted in the loss of 34 soldiers. Then came another on July 4
with a loss of 13 more. Then on July 12 another encounter by troops
under General Howard himself, in which 11 soldiers were killed and 26
wounded. (_Comr., 24._)

Then began one of the most remarkable exhibitions of generalship in
the history of our Indian wars, a retreat worthy to be remembered with
that of the storied ten thousand. With hardly a hundred warriors, and
impeded by more than 350 helpless women and children—with General
Howard behind, with Colonel (General) Miles in front, and with Colonel
Sturgis and the Crow scouts coming down upon his flank—Chief Joseph
led his little band up the Clearwater and across the mountains into
Montana, turning at Big Hole pass long enough to beat back his pursuers
with a loss of 60 men; then on by devious mountain trails southeast
into Yellowstone park, where he again turned on Howard and drove him
back with additional loss of men and horses; then out of Wyoming and
north into Montana again, hoping to find safety on Canadian soil, until
intercepted in the neighborhood of the Yellowstone by Colonel Sturgis
in front with fresh troops and a detachment of Crow scouts, with whom
they sustained two more encounters, this time with heavy loss of men
and horses to themselves; then again eluding their pursuers, this
handful of starving and worn-out warriors, now reduced to scarcely
fifty able men, carrying their wounded and their helpless families,
crossed the Missouri and entered the Bearpaw mountains. But new enemies
were on their trail, and at last, when within 50 miles of the land of
refuge, Miles, with a fresh army, cut off their retreat by a decisive
blow, capturing more than half their horses, killing a number of the
band, including Joseph’s brother and the noted chief Looking Glass, and
wounding 40 others. (_Comr., 25._)

Forced either to surrender or to abandon the helpless wounded, the
women, and children, Joseph chose to surrender to Colonel Miles, on
October 5, 1877, after a masterly retreat of more than a thousand
miles. He claimed that this was “a conditional surrender, with a
distinct promise that he should go back to Idaho in the spring.”
(_Comr., 26._) The statement of General Howard’s aid-de-camp is
explicit on this point:

  It was promised Joseph that he would be taken to Tongue river
  and kept there till spring, and then be returned to Idaho.
  General Sheridan, ignoring the promises made on the battlefield,
  ostensibly on account of the difficulty of getting supplies there
  from Fort Buford, ordered the hostiles to Leavenworth, ... but
  different treatment was promised them when they held rifles in
  their hands. (_Sutherland, 1._)

Seven years passed before the promise was kept, and in the meantime the
band had been reduced by disease and death in Indian Territory from
about 450 to about 280.

This strong testimony to the high character of Joseph, and his people
and the justice of their cause comes from the commissioner at the head
of Indian affairs during and immediately after the outbreak:

  I traveled with him in Kansas and the Indian Territory for nearly
  a week and found him to be one of the most gentlemanly and
  well-behaved Indians that I ever met. He is bright and intelligent,
  and is anxious for the welfare of his people.... The Nez Percés
  are very much superior to the Osages and Pawnees in the Indian
  Territory; they are even brighter than the Poncas, and care should
  be taken to place them where they will thrive.... It will be borne
  in mind that Joseph has never made a treaty with the United States,
  and that he has never surrendered to the government the lands he
  claimed to own in Idaho.... I had occasion in my last annual report
  to say that “Joseph and his followers have shown themselves to
  be brave men and skilled soldiers, who, with one exception, have
  observed the rules of civilized warfare, and have not mutilated
  their dead enemies.” These Indians were encroached upon by white
  settlers on soil they believed to be their own, and when these
  encroachments became intolerable they were compelled, in their own
  estimation, to take up arms. (_Comr., 27a._)

In all our sad Indian history there is nothing to exceed in pathetic
eloquence the surrender speech of the Nez Percé chief:

  I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed. Looking Glass is
  dead. Toohulhulsote is dead. The old men are all dead. It is the
  young men who say yes or no. He who led the young men is dead. It
  is cold and we have no blankets. The little children are freezing
  to death. My people, some of them, have run away to the hills and
  have no blankets, no food. No one knows where they are—perhaps
  freezing to death. I want to have time to look for my children and
  see how many of them I can find. Maybe I shall find them among the
  dead. Hear me, my chiefs. I am tired. My heart is sick and sad.
  From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever. (_Sec.
  War, 3._)




                             +Chapter VII+

                       SMOHALLA AND HIS DOCTRINE

  My young men shall never work. Men who work can not dream, and
  wisdom comes to us in dreams.... You ask me to plow the ground.
  Shall I take a knife and tear my mother’s bosom? You ask me to dig
  for stone. Shall I dig under her skin for her bones? You ask me to
  cut grass and make hay and sell it and be rich like white men. But
  how dare I cut off my mother’s hair?—_Smohalla._


We hear little of Smohalla for several years after the Nez Percé war
until the opening of the Northern Pacific railroad in 1883 once more
brought to a focus the land grievances of the Indians in that section.
Along Yakima valley the railroad “was located through Indian fields and
orchards, with little respect for individual rights,” while the host
of prospective settlers who at once swarmed into the country showed
the usual white man’s consideration for the native proprietors. Some
of the Indians, breaking away from their old traditions in order to
obtain permanent homes before everything should be taken up by the
whites, had gone out and selected homesteads under the law, and the
agent was now using the Indian police to compel them to return to the
reservation, “and the singular anomaly was presented of the United
States Indian agent on the one hand applying for troops to drive the
Indians from their homestead settlements to the reservation a hundred
miles away, and on the other the Indians telegraphing to the military
authorities to send troops to protect them from the Indian police.”
(_MacMurray MS._) In addition to their land troubles the Yakima and
their confederated tribes, among whom were many progressive and even
prosperous Indians, were restive under constant interference with their
religious (Smohalla) ceremonies, to which a large proportion adhered.

In order to learn the nature of the dissatisfaction of the Indians, and
if possible to remove the cause, General Miles, then commanding the
military department of the Columbia, sent Major J. W. MacMurray to the
scene of the disturbance in June, 1884. He spent about a year in the
work, visiting the various villages of the upper Columbia, especially
Pʿnä at Priest rapids, where he met Smohalla, the high priest of the
Dreamer theology, and his report on the subject is invaluable.

Smohalla is the chief of the Wa′napûm, a small tribe in Washington,
numbering probably less than 200 souls, commonly known rather
indefinitely as “Columbia River Indians,” and roaming along both banks
of the Columbia from the neighborhood of Priest rapids down to the
entrance of Snake river. They are of Shahaptian stock and closely
akin to the Yakima and Nez Percés, and have never made a treaty with
the government. Among his own people and his disciples in the
neighboring tribes he is known as Shmóqûla, “The Preacher.”[5] He is
also frequently called Yu′yunipĭ′tqana, “The Shouting Mountain,” from
a belief among his followers that a part of his revelation came to
him from a mountain which became instinct with life and spoke into
his soul while he lay dreaming upon it. Still another name by which
he is sometimes known is Waip-shwa, or “Rock Carrier,” the reason
for which does not appear. The name which belonged to him in youth,
before assuming his priestly function, is now forgotten. For more
than forty years he has resided at the Wanapûm village of Pʿnä on
the west bank of the Columbia, at the foot of Priest rapids, in what
is now Yakima county, Washington. The name Pʿnä signifies “a fish
weir,” this point being a great rendezvous for the neighboring tribes
during the salmon-fishing season. These frequent gatherings afford
abundant opportunity for the teaching and dissemination of his peculiar
doctrines, as is sufficiently evident from the fact that, while his own
tribe numbers hardly two score families, his disciples along the river
are counted by thousands.

[Illustration: PL. LXXXVIII

  DISTRIBUTION OF TRIBES OF THE UPPER COLUMBIA REGION IN WASHINGTON,
  OREGON AND IDAHO INCLUDING ALL THOSE OF THE SMOHALLA AND SHAKER
  RELIGIONS BY JAMES MOONEY 1894]

Smohalla was born about 1815 or 1820, and is consequently now an old
man, although still well preserved, and with his few scattering locks
unchanged in color. At the time of the Nez Percé war he was in the
full vigor of manhood. His appearance in 1884 is thus described by
Major MacMurray: “In person Smohalla is peculiar. Short, thick-set,
bald-headed and almost hunch-backed, he is not prepossessing at first
sight, but he has an almost Websterian head, with a deep brow over
bright, intelligent eyes. He is a finished orator. His manner is mostly
of the bland, insinuating, persuasive style, but when aroused he is
full of fire and seems to handle invectives effectively. His audience
seemed spellbound under his magic manner, and it never lost interest
to me, though he spoke in a language comprehended by few white men and
translated to me at second or third hand.” By another writer who met
him a year later he is described as rather undersized and inclining
toward obesity, with “a reserved and cunning but not ill-natured
countenance, and a large, well-shaped head. His manners were more suave
and insinuating than is usual with Indians.” He had a comfortable
appearance, his moccasins and leggings were new, and he rode a good
pinto pony. (_Huggins, 1._)

In his youth he had frequented the Catholic mission of Atahnam among
the Yakima, where he became familiar with the forms of that service
and also acquired a slight knowledge of French. Whether or not he
was a regular member of the mission school is a disputed point, as
it is asserted by some that he has never worn the white man’s dress
or had his hair cut. The influence of the Catholic ceremonial is
plainly visible in his own ritual performance. In his early manhood he
distinguished himself as a warrior, and had already come to be regarded
as a prominent man when he first began to preach his peculiar theology
about the year 1850. There can be no question that the rapid spread of
his doctrines among the tribes of the Columbia materially facilitated
their confederation in the Yakima war of 1855–56. It is said that he
aspired to be the leader in this war, and that, to attain this end, he
invited all the neighboring bands to attend a council at his village of
Pʿnä, but failed to accomplish his object.

Shortly after the close of the war, probably about 1860, the incident
occurred which wrought an entire change in his life, stamping him as
an oracle and prophet beyond peradventure, and giving to his religious
system the force of authority which it has ever since retained. He had
already established a reputation as a medicine-man, and was believed
to be “making medicine” against the life of Moses, the noted chief of
a tribe farther up the river, who was greatly in dread of his occult
powers, and forced a quarrel in order to rid himself forever of his
rival. A fight resulted, and Smohalla was nearly killed. It is said
that he was left on the ground as dead, but revived sufficiently to
crawl away and get into a boat on the bank of the Columbia near by.
Bleeding and disabled, he was carried down at the mercy of the current
until he was finally rescued from his perilous position by some white
men, far below. His recovery was slow. When it was completed, unwilling
to return in disgrace to his own country and probably still dreading
the anger of Moses, he determined to become a wanderer.

Then began one of the most remarkable series of journeyings ever
undertaken by an uncivilized Indian. Going down the Columbia to
Portland and the coast, he turned south, and, stopping on the way at
various points in Oregon and California, continued beyond San Diego
into Mexico. Then, turning again, he came back through Arizona, Utah,
and Nevada to his former home on the Columbia, where he announced that
he had been dead and in the spirit world and had now returned by divine
command to guide his people. As he was thought to have been killed in
the encounter with Moses, and as he had disappeared so completely until
now, his awe-stricken hearers readily believed that they were actually
in the presence of one who had been taken bodily into the spirit world,
whence he was now sent back as a teacher.

On the occasion of MacMurray’s visit, says that authority, “Smohalla
asked me many geographic questions, and I spread out a railroad map,
marking the situation of Priest rapids, Portland, and Vancouver
barracks, and he traced with a straw down the coast line to below San
Diego. He asked where San Bernardino was, and paused long over this.
He recognized the ocean or ‘salt chuck,’ with many other geographic
features and localities, but he would neither admit nor deny having
been at Salt Lake City, although he admitted having been in Utah,
knew the lake and adjacent mountain chains, and said that he had seen
Mormon priests getting commands direct from heaven. He dwelt long over
Arizona, and remarked, ‘_bad-a Inchun_.’”

Smohalla now declared to his people that the Sa′ghalee Tyee, the Great
Chief Above, was angry at their apostasy, and commanded them through
him to return to their primitive manners, as their present miserable
condition in the presence of the intrusive race was due to their
having abandoned their own religion and violated the laws of nature
and the precepts of their ancestors. He then explained in detail the
system to which they must adhere in future if they would conform to
the expressed will of the higher power. It was a system based on the
primitive aboriginal mythology and usage, with an elaborate ritual
which combined with the genuine Indian features much of what he had
seen and remembered of Catholic ceremonial and military parade, with
perhaps also some additions from Mormon forms.

His words made a deep impression on his hearers. They had indeed
abandoned their primitive simplicity to a great extent, and were now
suffering the penalty in all the misery that had come to them with the
advent of the white-skin race that threatened to blot them out from the
earth. The voice of the prophet was accepted as a voice from the other
world, for they knew that he had been dead and was now alive. What he
said must be true and wise, for he had been everywhere and knew tribes
and countries they had never heard of. Even the white men confirmed his
words in this regard. He could even control the sun and the moon, for
he had said when they would be dark, and they were dark.

If genius be a form of insanity, as has been claimed, intense religious
enthusiasm would seem to have a close connection with physical as well
as mental disease. Like Mohammed and Joan of Arc, and like the Shaker
prophet of Puget sound, Smohalla is subject to cataleptic trances,
and it is while in this unconscious condition that he is believed to
receive his revelations. Says MacMurray:

  He falls into trances and lies rigid for considerable periods.
  Unbelievers have experimented by sticking needles through his
  flesh, cutting him with knives, and otherwise testing his
  sensibility to pain, without provoking any responsive action. It
  was asserted that he was surely dead, because blood did not flow
  from the wounds. These trances always excite great interest and
  often alarm, as he threatens to abandon his earthly body altogether
  because of the disobedience of his people, and on each occasion
  they are in a state of suspense as to whether the Saghalee Tyee
  will send his soul back to earth to reoccupy his body, or will, on
  the contrary, abandon and leave them without his guidance. It is
  this going into long trances, out of which he comes as from heavy
  sleep and almost immediately relates his experiences in the spirit
  land, that gave rise to the title of “Dreamers,” or believers
  in dreams, commonly given to his followers by the neighboring
  whites. His actions are similar to those of a trance medium, and if
  self-hypnotization be practicable that would seem to explain it. I
  questioned him as to his trances and hoped to have him explain them
  to me, but he avoided the subject and was angered when I pressed
  him. He manifestly believes all he says of what occurs to him in
  this trance state. As we have hundreds of thousands of educated
  white people who believe in similar fallacies, this is not more
  unlikely in an Indian subjected to such influence.

In studying Smohalla we have to deal with the same curious mixture of
honest conviction and cunning deception that runs through the history
of priestcraft in all the ages. Like some other prophets before him,
he seeks to convey the idea that he is in control of the elements and
the heavenly bodies, and he has added greatly to his reputation by
predicting several eclipses. This he was enabled to do by the help
of an almanac and some little explanation from a party of surveyors.
In this matter, however, he was soon made to realize that a little
knowledge is a dangerous thing. He could not get another almanac, and
his astronomic prophecies came to an abrupt termination at the end of
the first year. Concerning this, Major MacMurray says:

  He showed me an almanac of a preceding year and asked me to
  readjust it for eclipses, as it did not work as it had formerly
  done. I explained that Washington (the Naval Observatory) made new
  ones every year, and that old ones could not be fixed up to date.
  He had probably obtained this one from the station agent at the
  railroad, now superseded by a new one, who had cut off Smohalla’s
  supply of astronomical data. My inability to repair the 1882
  almanac for use in prognosticating in 1884 cost me much of his
  respect as a wise man from the east. (_MacMurray MS._)

Smohalla had also a blank book containing mysterious characters, some
of which resembled letters of the alphabet, and which he said were
records of events and prophecies. MacMurray was unable to decide
whether they were mnemonic or were simply unmeaning marks intended to
foster among his followers the impression of his superior wisdom. It is
probable that they were genuine mnemonic symbols invented by himself
for his own purposes, as such systems, devised and used by single
individuals or families, and unintelligible to others, are by no means
rare among those who may be called the literary men of our aboriginal
tribes.

[Illustration: PL. LXXXIX

  SMOHALLA AND HIS PRIESTS]

As their principal troubles arose out of the disputed title to their
lands, Major MacMurray was asked by the Indians to explain the Indian
homestead law and how white men divided land. This was carefully done
with the aid of a checkerboard, and they were shown how the land was
mapped out into equal squares arranged on straight lines so that every
man could find his own. They were then urged by the officer to apply
for homesteads and settle upon them so as to avoid further trouble
with the new settlers who were pouring into the country. Smohalla
replied that he knew all this, but he did not like the new law, as it
was against nature. He then went on to expound in detail the Indian
cosmogony. Said he:

  I will tell you about it. Once the world was all water and God
  lived alone. He was lonesome, he had no place to put his foot, so
  he scratched the sand up from the bottom and made the land, and
  he made the rocks, and he made trees, and he made a man; and the
  man had wings and could go anywhere. The man was lonesome, and
  God made a woman. They ate fish from the water, and God made the
  deer and other animals, and he sent the man to hunt and told the
  woman to cook the meat and to dress the skins. Many more men
  and women grew up, and they lived on the banks of the great river
  whose waters were full of salmon. The mountains contained much game
  and there were buffalo on the plains. There were so many people
  that the stronger ones sometimes oppressed the weak and drove them
  from the best fisheries, which they claimed as their own. They
  fought and nearly all were killed, and their bones are to be seen
  in the hills yet. God was very angry at this and he took away their
  wings and commanded that the lands and fisheries should be common
  to all who lived upon them; that they were never to be marked off
  or divided, but that the people should enjoy the fruits that God
  planted in the land, and the animals that lived upon it, and the
  fishes in the water. God said he was the father and the earth was
  the mother of mankind; that nature was the law; that the animals,
  and fish, and plants obeyed nature, and that man only was sinful.
  This is the old law.

  I know all kinds of men. First there were my people (the Indians);
  God made them first. Then he made a Frenchman [referring to the
  Canadian voyagers of the Hudson Bay company], and then he made a
  priest [priests accompanied these expeditions of the Hudson Bay
  company]. A long time after that came Boston men [Americans are
  thus called in the Chinook jargon, because the first of our nation
  came into the Columbia river in 1796 in a ship from Boston], and
  then King George men [the English]. Later came black men, and last
  God made a Chinaman with a tail. He is of no account and has to
  work all the time like a woman. All these are new people. Only the
  Indians are of the old stock. After awhile, when God is ready, he
  will drive away all the people except those who have obeyed his
  laws.

  Those who cut up the lands or sign papers for lands will be
  defrauded of their rights and will be punished by God’s anger.
  Moses was bad. God did not love him. He sold his people’s houses
  and the graves of their dead. It is a bad word that comes from
  Washington. It is not a good law that would take my people away
  from me to make them sin against the laws of God.

  You ask me to plow the ground! Shall I take a knife and tear my
  mother’s bosom? Then when I die she will not take me to her bosom
  to rest.

  You ask me to dig for stone! Shall I dig under her skin for her
  bones? Then when I die I can not enter her body to be born again.

  You ask me to cut grass and make hay and sell it, and be rich like
  white men! But how dare I cut off my mother’s hair?

  It is a bad law, and my people can not obey it. I want my people to
  stay with me here. All the dead men will come to life again. Their
  spirits will come to their bodies again. We must wait here in the
  homes of our fathers and be ready to meet them in the bosom of our
  mother. (_MacMurray MS._)

The idea that the earth is the mother of all created things lies at
the base, not only of the Smohalla religion, but of the theology of
the Indian tribes generally and of primitive races all over the world.
This explains Tecumtha’s reply to Harrison: “The sun is my father and
the earth is my mother. On her bosom I will rest.” In the Indian mind
the corn, fruits, and edible roots are the gifts which the earth-mother
gives freely to her children. Lakes and ponds are her eyes, hills
are her breasts, and streams are the milk flowing from her breasts.
Earthquakes and underground noises are signs of her displeasure at the
wrongdoing of her children. Especially are the malarial fevers, which
often follow extensive disturbance of the surface by excavation or
otherwise, held to be direct punishments for the crime of lacerating
her bosom.

Smohalla’s chief supporter and assistant at the ceremonies was
Kotai′aqan, or Coteea′kun, as MacMurray spells it, of the Yakima
tribe. The name refers to a brood of young ducks scattering in alarm.
He was the son of Kamai′äkan, the great war chief of the Yakima. He
also gave MacMurray the story of the cosmos, which agrees with that
obtained from Smohalla, but is more in detail:

  The world was all water, and Saghalee Tyee was above it. He threw
  up out of the water at shallow places large quantities of mud, and
  that made the land. Some was piled so high that it froze hard,
  and the rains that fell were made into snow and ice. Some of the
  earth was made hard into rocks, and anyone could see that it had
  not changed—it was only harder. We have no records of the past;
  but we have it from our fathers from far back that Saghalee Tyee
  threw down many of the mountains he had made. It is all as our
  fathers told us, and we can see that it is true when we are hunting
  for game or berries in the mountains. I did not see it done. He
  made trees to grow, and he made a man out of a ball of mud and
  instructed him in what he should do. When the man grew lonesome, he
  made a woman as his companion, and taught her to dress skins, and
  to gather berries, and to make baskets of the bark of roots, which
  he taught her how to find.

  She was asleep and dreaming of her ignorance of how to please man,
  and she prayed to Saghalee Tyee to help her. He breathed on her
  and gave her something that she could not see, or hear, or smell,
  or touch, and it was preserved in a little basket, and by it all
  the arts of design and skilled handiwork were imparted to her
  descendants.

  Notwithstanding all the benefits they enjoyed, there was quarreling
  among the people, and the earth-mother was angry. The mountains
  that overhung the river at the Cascades were thrown down, and
  dammed the stream and destroyed the forests and whole tribes, and
  buried them under the rocks. (_MacMurray MS._)

In connection with the wonderful little basket, MacMurray states that
Kotai′aqan presented him with a very ancient drum-shape basket, about
2½ inches in diameter, to give to his wife, in order that she might
likewise be inspired. Concerning the catastrophe indicated in the last
paragraph, he goes on to say:

  The Cascade range, where it crosses the Columbia river, exhibits
  enormous cross sections of lava, and at its base are petrified
  trunks of trees, which have been covered and hidden from view
  except where the wash of the mighty stream has exposed them.
  Indians have told me, of their knowledge, that, buried deep under
  these outpours of basalt, or volcanic tufa, are bones of animals
  of _siah_, or the long ago. Traditions of the great landslide at
  the Cascades are many, but vary little in form. According to one
  account, the mountain tops fell together and formed a kind of
  arch, under which the water flowed, until the overhanging rocks
  finally fell into the stream and made a dam or gorge. As the rock
  is columnar basalt, very friable and easily disintegrated, that
  was not impossible, and the landscape suggests some such giant
  avalanche. The submerged trees are plainly visible near this
  locality. Animal remains I have not seen, but these salmon-eating
  Indians have lived on the river’s border through countless
  ages, and know every feature in their surroundings by constant
  association for generations, and naturally ally these facts with
  their religious theories. (_MacMurray MS._)

In an article on “The submerged trees of the Columbia river,” in
Science of February 18, 1887, the geologist, Major Clarence E. Dutton,
also notices the peculiar formation at the Cascades and mentions the
Indian tradition of a natural bridge over the river at this point.

  SMOHALLA CHURCH ON YAKIMA RESERVATION]

MacMurray continues:

  Coteeakun went on to say that some day Saghalee Tyee would again
  overturn the mountains and so expose these bones, which, having
  been preserved through so long a time, would be reoccupied by
  the spirits which now dwell in the mountain tops, watching their
  descendants on earth and waiting for the resurrection to come. The
  voices of these spirits of the dead can be heard at all times in
  the mountains, and often they answer back when spoken to. Mourners
  who wail for their dead hear spirit voices replying, and know they
  will always remain near them. No man knows when it will come, and
  only those who have observed nature’s laws and adhered to the
  faith of their ancestors will have their bones so preserved and be
  certain of an earthly tenement for their spirits. He wanted me to
  confirm this.

  Coteeakun was pacific and gentle. He said all men were as brothers
  to him and he hoped all would dwell together. He had been told
  that white and black and all other kinds of men originally dwelt
  in tents, as the red men always have done, and that God in former
  times came to commune with white men. He thought there could be
  only one Saghalee Tyee, in which case white and red men would live
  on a common plane. We came from one source of life and in time
  would “grow from one stem again. It would be like a stick that the
  whites held by one end and the Indians by the other until it was
  broken, and it would be made again into one stick.”

  Some of the wilder Indians to the north have more truculent ideas
  as to the final cataclysm which is to reoverturn the mountains
  and bring back the halcyon days of the long past. As the whites
  and the others came only within the lifetime of the fathers of
  these Indians, they are not to be included in the benefits of the
  resurrection, but are to be turned over with all that the white
  man’s civilization has put upon the present surface of the land.

  Coteeakun was for progress—limited progress, it is true—to the
  extent of fixed homes and agriculture, but he did not want his
  people to go from their villages or to abandon their religious
  faith. They were nearly all disposed to work for wages among the
  farmers, and had orchards and some domestic animals upon whose
  produce they lived, besides the fish from the rivers. Smohalla
  opposed anything that pertained to civilization, and had neither
  cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, nor chickens, and not a tree or
  vegetable was grown anywhere in his vicinage. Kowse (_Peucedanum
  cous_), kamas (_Camassia esculenta_), berries, fish, and the game
  of the mountains alone furnished food to his people, whom he
  advised to resist every advance of civilization as improper for
  a true Indian and in violation of the faith of their ancestors.
  I found, however, that he was willing to advise his people to
  take up lands and adopt the white man’s road, if the government
  would pension him as it had pensioned Chief Moses, so that while I
  thought he believed in his religion as much as other sectarians do
  in theirs, he was tainted by the mercenary desire to live upon his
  followers unless otherwise provided for by the government.

From Captain E. L. Huggins, Second cavalry, who visited Smohalla about
the same time, we obtain further information concerning the prophet’s
personality and doctrines. When Smohalla was urged to follow the
example of other Indians who had taken up the white man’s road, he
replied, “No one has any respect for these book Indians. Even the white
men like me better and treat me better than they do the book Indians.
My young men shall never work. Men who work can not dream, and wisdom
comes to us in dreams.”

When it was argued that the whites worked and yet knew more than the
Indians, he replied that the white man’s wisdom was poor and weak and
of no value to Indians, who must learn the highest wisdom from dreams
and from participating in the Dreamer ceremonies. Being pressed to
explain the nature of this higher knowledge, he replied, “Each one must
learn for himself the highest wisdom. It can not be taught. You have
the wisdom of your race. Be content.”

When the officer contended that even the Indians had to work hard
during the fishing season to get food for winter, the prophet answered:

“This work lasts only for a few weeks. Besides it is natural work and
does them no harm. But the work of the white man hardens soul and body.
Nor is it right to tear up and mutilate the earth as white men do.”

To the officer’s assertion that the Indians also dug roots and were
even then digging kamas in the mountains, he replied:

“We simply take the gifts that are freely offered. We no more harm
the earth than would an infant’s fingers harm its mother’s breast.
But the white man tears up large tracts of land, runs deep ditches,
cuts down forests, and changes the whole face of the earth. You know
very well this is not right. Every honest man,” said he, looking at me
searchingly, “knows in his heart that this is all wrong. But the white
men are so greedy they do not consider these things.”

He asserted that the Indians were now so helpless before the white men
that they must cease to exist unless they had assistance from a higher
power, but that if they heeded the sacred message they would receive
strong and sudden help as surely as the spring comes after winter. When
some doubt was expressed as to his own faith in these things, he asked
pointedly:

“Do the white teachers believe what they teach?”

“It is said, Smohalla, that you hate all white men.”

“It is not true. But the whites have caused us great suffering. Dr
Whitman many years ago made a long journey to the east to get a bottle
of poison for us. He was gone about a year, and after he came back
strong and terrible diseases broke out among us. The Indians killed Dr
Whitman, but it was too late. He had uncorked his bottle and all the
air was poisoned. Before that there was little sickness among us, but
since then many of us have died. I have had children and grandchildren,
but they are all dead. My last grandchild, a young woman of 16, died
last month. If only her infant could have lived”—his voice faltered
slightly, but with scarcely a pause he continued in his former tone, “I
labored hard to save them, but my medicine would not work as it used
to.”

He repelled the idea that the Indians had profited by the coming of the
whites, and especially denied that they had obtained ponies from this
source. His statement on this point may be of interest to those who
hold that the horse is indigenous to America:

“What! The white man gave us ponies? Oh, no; we had ponies long before
we ever saw white people. The Great Spirit gave them to us. Our horses
were swifter and more enduring, too, in those days, before they were
mixed with the white man’s horses.”

He went on to tell how the Indians had befriended the first explorers
who came among them and how ungrateful had been their later recompense,
and said: “We are now so few and weak that we can offer no resistance,
and their preachers have persuaded them to let a few of us live, so as
to claim credit with the Great Spirit for being generous and humane.
But they begrudge us what little grass our ponies eat.” At parting he
repeated earnestly, “If they tell you Smohalla hates all white people,
do not believe it.” (_Huggins, 2._)

                   *       *       *       *       *

Our knowledge of the Smohalla ritual is derived from the account
given by Major MacMurray and from the statements of Yakima and Pälus
informants. The officer’s account is that of an intelligent observer,
who noted ceremonies closely, but without fully comprehending their
meaning. The Indian account is that of initiates and true believers,
one of them being the regular interpreter of the Smohalla services on
Yakima reservation.

The officer had already seen the ceremonial performances at the Indian
villages at Celilo and Umatilla in Oregon, at Tumwater and Yakima gap
in Washington, but found its greatest development at the fountain
head, the home of Smohalla at Priest rapids. His account is so full of
interest that we give it almost in its entirety.

While still several miles away, his party discovered the village,
the houses extending along the bank of the river, with several flags
attached to long poles fluttering in the wind. The trail from the
mountains was winding and difficult, but at last—

  We reached the plain and were met by a procession, headed by
  Smohalla in person, all attired in gorgeous array and mounted on
  their best chargers. We wended our way through sagebrush and sand
  dunes to the village street, not a soul being visible, but from the
  mat-roofed salmon houses there came forth the most indescribable
  chorus of bell ringing, drum beating, and screeching. I noticed
  that the street was neatly swept and well sprinkled—an unusual
  thing in any Indian village. This, Smohalla said, was in my honor
  and to show that his people had cleanly tastes. Our procession
  passed on beyond the village to a new canvas tent, which had a
  brush shade to keep off the sun and was lined and carpeted with
  new and very pretty matting. Smohalla said this had been prepared
  especially for me, and was to be my house as long as I should stay
  with him. To cap the climax, he had constructed a bench for me,
  having sent more than 90 miles for the nails. Fresh salmon, caught
  in a peculiar trap among the rocks and broiled on a plank, were
  regularly furnished my party, and with hard tack and coffee of our
  own supplying we got enough to eat and drink. Our own blankets
  furnished sleeping conveniences. The river was within two yards of
  our tent door and was an ample lavatory.

  When I awoke the next morning, the sound of drums was again heard,
  and for days it continued. I do not remember that there was any
  intermission except for a few minutes at a time. Seven bass drums
  were used for the purpose. I was invited to be present, and took
  great interest in the ceremonies, which I shall endeavor to
  describe.

  There was a small open space to the north of the larger house,
  which was Smohalla’s residence and the village assembly room as
  well. This space was inclosed by a whitewashed fence made of
  boards which had drifted down the river. In the middle was a
  flagstaff with a rectangular flag, suggesting a target. In the
  center of the flag was a round red patch. The field was yellow,
  representing grass, which is there of a yellow hue in summer. A
  green border indicated the boundary of the world, the hills being
  moist and green near their tops. At the top of the flag was a small
  extension of blue color, with a white star in the center. Smohalla
  explained: “This is my flag, and it represents the world. God
  told me to look after my people—all are my people. There are four
  ways in the world—north and south and east and west. I have been
  all those ways. This is the center. I live here. The red spot is
  my heart—everybody can see it. The yellow grass grows everywhere
  around this place. The green mountains are far away all around the
  world. There is only water beyond, salt water. The blue [referring
  to the blue cloth strip] is the sky, and the star is the north
  star. That star never changes; it is always in the same place. I
  keep my heart on that star. I never change.”

  There are frequent services, a sort of processional around the
  outside of the fence, the prophet and a small boy with a bell
  entering the inclosure, where, after hoisting the flag, he delivers
  a sort of sermon. Captains or class leaders give instructions to
  the people, who are arranged according to stature, the men and
  women in different classes marching in single file to the sound of
  drums. There seems to be a regular system of signals, at command
  of the prophet, by the boy with the bell, upon which the people
  chant loud or low, quick or slow, or remain silent. These outdoor
  services occurred several times each day.

[Illustration: +Fig. 64+—Smohalla’s flag (heraldic).]

  Smohalla invited me to participate in what he considered a grand
  ceremonial service within the larger house. This house was built
  with a framework of stout logs placed upright in the ground and
  roofed over with brush, or with canvas in rainy weather. The sides
  consisted of bark and rush matting. It was about 75 feet long by
  25 feet wide. Singing and drumming had been going on for some time
  when I arrived. The air resounded with the voices of hundreds of
  Indians, male and female, and the banging of drums. Within, the
  room was dimly lighted. Smoke curled from a fire on the floor at
  the farther end and pervaded the atmosphere. The ceiling was hung
  with hundreds of salmon, split and drying in the smoke.

  The scene was a strange one. On either side of the room was a
  row of twelve women standing erect with arms crossed and hands
  extended, with finger tips at the shoulders. They kept time to the
  drums and their voices by balancing on the balls of their feet and
  tapping with their heels on the floor, while they chanted with
  varying pitch and time. The excitement and persistent repetition
  wore them out, and I heard that others than Smohalla had seen
  visions in their trances, but I saw none who would admit it or
  explain anything of it. I fancied they feared their own action, and
  that real death might come to them in this simulated death.

  Those on the right hand were dressed in garments of a red color
  with an attempt at uniformity. Those on the left wore costumes of
  white buckskin, said to be very ancient ceremonial costumes, with
  red and blue trimmings. All wore large round silver plates or such
  other glittering ornaments as they possessed. A canvas covered the
  floor and on it knelt the men and boys in lines of seven. Each
  seven, as a rule, had shirts of the same color. The tallest were
  in front, the size diminishing regularly to the rear. Children and
  ancient hags filled in any spare space. In front on a mattress
  knelt Smohalla, his left hand covering his heart. On his right
  was the boy bell ringer in similar posture. Smohalla wore a white
  garment which he was pleased to call a priest’s gown, but it was
  simply a white cloth shirt with a colored stripe down the back.

[Illustration: PL. XCI

  INTERIOR OF SMOHALLA CHURCH]

  I and my two assistants were seated on a mattress about 10 feet in
  front of the prophet, which fortunately placed us near the door
  and incidentally near fresh air. There were two other witnesses,
  Indians from distant villages, who sat at one side with Smohalla’s
  son looking on.

  Smohalla’s son was said to be in training as his successor. He was
  a young man, apparently about 23 years old, tall, slender, and
  active in movement, and commonly kept himself apart from the body
  of the people. He was much darker than his father. His dress was
  brilliant in style and color. He ordinarily wore a short gown or
  surplice, sometimes yellow and at other times sky blue, with ornate
  decorations of stars or moons appliqué, cut from bright-colored
  cloths. The sleeves were extravagantly trimmed with beads and
  silver ornaments. He knelt at the right of the group as the place
  of honor. On his left was Coteeakun, the head man of the Indian
  village at Union gap, on the Yakima reservation. The third man was
  Coteeakun’s brother, a most intelligent and progressive Indian.
  (_MacMurray MS._)

From Charles Ike, an intelligent half-blood interpreter on Yakima
reservation, who is also the regular interpreter of the Smohalla
ritual services at the Yakima village of Paʾkiut, we obtain additional
interesting details concerning the ceremony as there performed, with
the underlying religious teachings.

As at present taught, the religion finds adherents among probably all
the tribes along the Columbia from near the British border down to
the Wushqûm tribe at The Dalles, with the exception, perhaps, of the
Klikatat, who are nearly all Catholics. The two chief centers are at
Pʿnä or Priest rapids, where Smohalla in person regularly preaches to
about 120 hearers, and at Paʾkiut, at Union gap on Yakima reservation,
where, until his death a short time ago, Tianä′ni has regularly
conducted the services for about 300 of his tribe. At each place is a
church or meeting-house built as already described.

The former high priest of the doctrine among the Yakima, and the
right-hand man of Smohalla himself, was Kotai′aqan, already mentioned,
the son of the great war chief Kamai′äkan. It is even asserted that he
was the originator of the system. However this may be, it is certain
that he had much to do with formulating both the dogmas and the ritual.
In temper he was more gentle than Smohalla, and more disposed to meet
civilization half-way. On his death, about 1890, he was succeeded by
his stepson, Tīanä′ni, or “Many Wounds,” who filled the office until
about October, 1892, when he was murdered near his home by two drunken
Indians. He was succeeded in the chieftainship by a younger son of
Kotai′aqan named Sha′awĕ (or Shaw-wawa Kootiacan), and in his priestly
functions by a man known to the whites as Billy John.

The regular services take place on Sunday, in the morning, afternoon,
and evening. Sunday has been held sacred among the Nez Percés and
neighboring tribes for more than sixty years, as the result of the
teachings of the Hudson Bay officers. The prairie tribes also, having
learned that Sunday is the great “medicine day” of the whites, now
select it by preference for their own religious ceremonies of the
Ghost dance and the mescal. There are also services during the week,
besides special periodic observances, such as the “lament” for the
dead, particularly the dead chiefs, in early spring; the salmon dance,
when the salmon begin to run in April, and the berry dance, when the
wild berries ripen in autumn. The description of the ceremonial of the
salmon dance will answer for the others, as it differs chiefly only by
the addition of the feast.

[Illustration: +Fig. 65+—Charles Ike, Smohalla interpreter.]

As already stated, the house has the door at the eastern end, as is
the common rule in all Indian structures. On the roof, at the eastern
end of the building at Paʾkiut, are the flags, the center one blue,
representing the sky; another one white, representing the earthly
light, and the third yellow, representing the heavenly light of the
spirit world. Blue, white, and yellow are the sacred colors of this
system, as also of that of the Shakers, to be described later. On
entering, the worshipers range themselves in two lines along the sides
of the building, the men and boys standing along the northern wall,
the women and girls along the southern wall, and all facing toward the
center. The first man entering takes his place on the north nearest the
door; the next one stands just beyond him, and so on; while the women
and girls, when their turn comes, make the whole circuit along the
northern side, and then, turning at the farther end, take their places
in reverse order along the southern wall. In the open space between the
rows is a floor-walker, whose business it is to see that everyone is in
the right place. All are dressed as nearly as possible in the finest
style of the old Indian costume, buckskin and shell ornaments, their
faces painted yellow, white, or red with Indian paints, and carrying
eagle feathers in their right hands (plates +XC+, +XCI+; figure 66).

[Illustration: +Fig. 66+—Diagram showing arrangement of worshipers at
  Smohalla service.]

At the farther end, facing the door, sits the high priest, while just
behind him stands his “interpreter,” and on his left are seated on the
ground the three drummers with their large drums in front of them. The
high priest carries a large bell in his left hand and a smaller one in
his right.

Dishes of fresh-cooked salmon and jars of water, together with a
plentiful supply of other food, are ranged in front of the devotees.
After a preliminary ceremony in the nature of a litany, in which
the principal articles of their theology are recited in the form of
question and answer by the whole body of worshipers, the high priest
gives the command, “Take water,” when everyone raises a cup of water
to his lips. Next comes the command, “Now drink,” and each one takes a
sip. At the words, “Now the salmon,” each takes up a portion of fish,
which he puts into his mouth at the next command, “Now eat.” Last comes
the command, “Now help yourselves,” which is the signal for a general
attack on the provisions.

When everyone has satisfied his hunger, the remains of the feast are
cleared away and the “dance” begins. At a signal given by a single
stroke of the bell in the left hand of the high priest all stand up
in line on either side of the building. At another stroke of the bell
all put their right hands on their breasts. Another tap of the bell
and the right hand is brought out in front of the body. Another, and
they begin to move their right hands backward and forward like fans in
front of the breast, and thus continue throughout the dance, keeping
time also to the singing by balancing alternately upon their toes and
heels, as already described, without moving from their places. Ritual
songs are sung throughout the remainder of the service, in time with
the movements of the dancers and the sounds of the drums, and regulated
by the strokes of the bell.

Between songs anyone who wishes to speak steps out into the open
space. With a single tap of the bell the high priest then summons his
“interpreter,” standing behind him, who comes forward and stands beside
the speaker, a few feet in front and at the right of the high priest.
The speaker then in a low tone tells his story—usually a trance vision
of the spirit world—to the interpreter, who repeats it in a loud voice
to the company. At the end of the recital the high priest gives the
signal with the bell, when all raise their right hands with a loud
“Ai!” (Yes!). The high priest himself sometimes discourses also to the
people through the interpreter; at other times directly.

Each song is repeated until the high priest gives the signal with the
bell to stop. Most of the songs consist—in the native language—of seven
lines. At the end of the first line the high priest taps once with the
bell; at the end of the second line he taps twice, and so on to the
end of the song, when he rings the bell hard and continuously, and all
raise their hands with a loud “Ai!” Then the song leader, who stands
with a feather fan between the high priest and the drummers, starts the
next song.

The first song is given by all standing motionless, with the right hand
on the breast and with eyes cast downward. It may be rendered:

    Verily, verily, Our Brother made the body.
    He gave it a spirit and the body moved.
    Then he counted out the words for us to speak.

Another begins:

    Verily, Our Brother put salmon in the water to be our food.

Another begins:

    O, brothers! O, sisters!
    When first the light struck this world, it lighted the world forever.

Our Brother (_Nämi Piäp_) is the term used in referring to the creating
spirit, instead of “our father,” as we might expect them to say.

On leaving, at the close of the ceremony, the man nearest the high
priest passes around in front of him and down along in front of the
line of women, and as he reaches the door he turns around and bows to
the high priest. Each man in turn thus files around and passes out,
after which the women—first the one nearest the high priest and then
the others in regular order—pass out in the same manner. While the
worshipers are thus going out, the high priest, standing up, rings
continuously the small bell in his right hand, while with the larger
bell in his left he gives a single stroke as each one passes through
the door.


                    _Tribes of the Columbia region_

The following synopsis will give a good general idea of the location
and numbers of the tribes of the Columbia region from the British
line down to the Cascades, including all those under the influence
of the Smohalla religion. Except when derived from such well-known
authorities as Lewis and Clark, Stevens, Gibbs, etc., the information
given is the result of personal investigation and work with Yakima
and Pälus Indians. The general boundaries of the tribes west of the
Cascade range, including the adherents of the Shaker religion, are
also indicated on the accompanying map (plate +LXXXVIII+), but our
information in regard to this region is too meager to be definite.

+Kutenai+ (Kitunahan stock).—_Synonyms_: Arcs Plats, Cotonné, Cottonoi,
Coutanie, Flatbow, Kitunaha, Kootenai, Koutaine, Kutneha, Skalzi,
Tushepaw (Lewis and Clark, 1805), White-tailed Deer People (Clark,
Indian Sign Language). The Kutenai, properly Kituna′qa, form a distinct
linguistic stock, and live chiefly on the Canadian side, around Kutenai
river and lake, but extend across the line into northern Idaho and
northwestern Montana. Their extension southward dates from their treaty
of peace with the Flatheads about ninety years ago. In company with the
Flatheads they were accustomed formerly to come down from the mountains
in the fall to hunt the buffalo on the headwaters of the Missouri. They
are mentioned by Lewis and Clark in 1805 under the name of Tushepaw,
with bands distinguished as Ootlashoot, Micksucksealton (?), and
Hohilpo living in the mountains and on Clark’s fork within United
States territory. According to Gatschet, Tu′shipa is a collective term
applied by the Shoshoni to the tribes living north of them, including
the Nez Percés and others, as well as the Kutenai. A part of the
Kutenai joined with the Flatheads and Upper Pend d’Oreilles in a treaty
with the government in 1855 and are now on Flathead (Jocko) reservation
in Montana. They are probably all Catholics. Others, living in northern
Idaho, have never entered into treaty relations, and may be followers
of Smohalla. The best estimates for the last fifty years give those
within the United States a population of from 400 to 450.

+Pend d’Oreille+ (Salishan stock).—_Synonyms_: Calispel, Coospellar
(Lewis and Clark), Kahlispelm, Kalispelines, Kalispelusses, Kellespem,
Kullas-Palus, Ku′shpĕlu (a Yakima or Pälus form), Papshpûn-ʿlĕma
or “people of the great fir trees” (Yakima name), Pend d’Oreilles
or “ear-rings” (French name), Ponderas. The Pend d’Oreilles held
the country along the river and lake of the same name, in Idaho and
Washington, immediately southwest of the Kutenai. They are commonly
distinguished as Upper, on the lake, and Lower, on both banks of the
river. They are the Coospellar mentioned by Lewis and Clark in 1805.
They formerly crossed the mountains annually to hunt buffalo on the
Missouri. Since 1844 they and most of the other Salishan tribes of
this region have been under the influence of Catholic missionaries.
The Upper Pend d’Oreilles joined with the Flatheads and Kutenai in a
treaty with the government in 1855, and are now on Flathead reservation
in Montana. Some of the Lower band joined them there in 1887. Others
are on the Cœur d’Alêne reservation in Idaho, a few are with Moses on
the Columbia in Washington, and the rest are still in their original
country, never having entered into treaty stipulations. The whole tribe
numbers about 1,000 souls.

+Colville+ (Salishan stock).—_Synonyms_: Chaudière (French name),
Chualpay, Kettle Falls, Quiarlpi or “basket people” (Hale),
Schrooyelpi, Schwogelpi, Schwoyelpi, Swielpee, Wheelpoo (Lewis and
Clark). They originally occupied the country on Colville and Kettle
rivers and on both sides of the Columbia from Kettle falls down
to Spokane river, in Washington, and extending north into British
territory to about the lower Arrow lake. They are mentioned by Lewis
and Clark under the name of Wheelpoo. Kettle falls on the Columbia,
within their territory, was the great salmon fishing resort for all the
tribes of this region, and here, in 1846, was established the Catholic
mission of Saint Paul. As a result of this missionary work, all of
these Salishan tribes, excepting the Sanpoil, Nespelim, Mitaui, and a
part of the Spokan are now Catholics. In 1854, according to Stevens,
the original Shwoyelpi were nearly extinct and their places had been
filled by Indians from neighboring tribes. Without ever having entered
into any treaty with the government, they were assigned in 1872 to
Colville reservation, Washington, which had been set apart for the
tribes of that section. They were reported to number 616 in 1870, and
only 301 in 1892.

+Lake+ or +Senijextee+ (Salishan stock).—These owned the country on
both sides of the Columbia, in Washington, from about Kettle falls
northward into British Columbia to the vicinity of Arrow lake. They are
now on Colville reservation in Washington and number about 350, with
perhaps a few others across the boundary. They may be identical with
the Lahannas of Lewis and Clark.

+Spokan+ (Salishan stock).—_Synonyms_: Lartielo (Lewis and Clark),
Sarlilso (Gibbs), Sinhumanish, Sinkoman (Kutenai name), Spokihnish,
Spokomish, Zingomenes. They are commonly distinguished as Upper
Spokan or Sineeguomenah, Middle or Sintootoo, and Lower or
Chekisschee (_Winans, Comr., 1870_). Spokan is the name given them
by the Cœur d’Alênes; Sinkoman is their Kutenai name, while the
Lartielo or Sarlilso of Lewis and Clark is simply a bad misprint for
Sintootoo, the name of the middle band. They are closely connected,
linguistically and politically, with the Sanpoil and Nespelim. The
lower Spokan are now Protestants, the rest are Catholics. They formerly
owned the whole basin of Spokane river in Washington and extending into
Idaho. They are now on Spokane reservation in Washington and the Cœur
d’Alêne reservation in Idaho, and number in all about 900 or 1,000.

+Cœur d’Alêne+ (Salishan stock).—_Synonyms_: Pointed Hearts, Qʾma′shpăl
or “kamas people” (so called by the Yakima), Skeechaway, Skeetsomish
(Lewis and Clark), Skitsămŭq (Pälus name), Skitswish, Stietshoi.
They occupied the lake and river bearing their name in Idaho and the
adjacent headwaters of the Spokane. A part of this territory they
held jointly with the Spokan, whose language they speak. In 1892 they
numbered 427, on Cœur d’Alêne reservation in Idaho.

+Sanpoil+ (Salishan stock).—_Synonyms_: Hai-ai′nĭma (Yakima name),
Hihighenimmo (Lewis and Clark), Ipoilq (another Yakima name), Nʾpochle
(Stevens), Sans Puelles, Sinapoils, Sinipouals, Sinpaivelish,
Sinpohellechach, Sinpoilschne, Siur Poils. The name by which this
tribe is commonly known is sometimes written as a French form Sans
Poils, meaning “without bristles,” or “hairless,” but it is more
probably an Indian word. They occupy the country on Sanpoil river in
Washington, now included within Colville reservation, and are closely
allied with the Nespelim. These two tribes are the most aboriginal in
eastern Washington, and adhere strictly to their primitive customs and
religion. The two tribes are thus described by Winans, the government
farmer, in 1870:

  They have never received any presents from the government, although
  they have been frequently asked to do so. They seem suspicious
  of the whites, are the least civilized and most independent of
  any of the tribes of the territory. They are rich in horses and
  cattle, possessing all the comforts they know how to enjoy, and it
  appears their only fear is that they will be interfered with by the
  government. They are perfectly contented with their condition, and
  would not accept anything from the government if offered, except a
  religious instructor and doctor.

Some years later they were brought under the reservation system and
a change came o’er the spirit of their dream. In 1892 we are told
officially that “the Sanpuell Indians are the worst people that I
have anything to do with.... They are surly, ignorant, and filthy,”
notwithstanding which they still “have the same religious prejudice as
the Nespelims about receiving aid from the government.” Of the Nespelim
the same intelligent witness tells us that “they are a peculiar class
of Indians, having a religion of their own.” The religion of the
two tribes is aboriginal, and is similar to the Smohalla doctrine
in principle, although not in ceremonial. In 1892 the Sanpoil were
estimated at 300.

+Nespelim+ (Salishan stock).—_Synonyms_: Inspellum, Sinspeelish. On the
north bank of the Columbia, in Washington, along Nespelim river and
down to the junction of the Okinagan, and on the opposite side of the
Columbia down to about Grande Coulée. They speak the same language as
the Sanpoils, and in aboriginal habit, religion, and organization are
closely identified with them. They are within the limits of Colville
reservation and were reported to number only 62 in 1892.

+Okanagan+ (Salishan stock).—_Synonyms_: Oakinacken, Okinakane,
Okiwahkine. They occupy the whole basin of Okanagan river in
Washington, extending north into British Columbia, and including
Similkameen river. The Okanagan were an important tribe or confederacy
divided into a number of bands, some of which have also at times been
considered as belonging to the Spokan, while others are commonly
recognized as distinct tribes. Ross gives them “twelve tribes,”
as follows: Skamoynumach, Kewaughtchenunaugh, Pisscow (Piskwaus),
Incomecane′took, Tsillane (Chelan), Intie′took (Entiatook),
Battlelemuleemauch or Meatwho (Mitaui), Inspellum (Nespelim),
Sinpohellechach (Sanpoil), Sinwhoyelppetook (Colville), Samilkanuigh
(Similkameen), and Oakinacken (Okanagan). They are now included within
the Colville agency, and are Catholics. They were estimated at 340 in
1870 and reported as numbering 405 in 1892.

+Mitaui+ (Salishan stock).—_Synonyms_: Battlelemuleemauch, Meatwho,
Meshons, Meteowwee (Lewis and Clark), Methows, Mithouies. They formerly
lived on the west side of the Columbia, including the basins of the
Methow, Lake Chelan, and Entiatook river. Lewis and Clark met some
of them in 1805 below the mouth of the Wallawalla. They are closely
connected with the Piskwaus and Isle de Pierres. They now reside in
Nespelim valley on Colville reservation, confederated with the Isle
de Pierres under Chief Moses. The two tribes were reported at 390 in
1892. A few others live in the neighborhood of Kittitas near the Yakima
tribe. See _Piskwaus_.

+Isle de Pierre+ (Salishan stock).—_Synonyms_: Columbias, Linkinse,
Sinkiuse. They originally occupied the country in Washington from
the Columbia eastward to the Grande Coulée, extending from about the
mouth of the Grande Coulée down nearly to Crab creek. Isle de Pierre
is the French name of Rock island in the Columbia at the mouth of the
Wenatchee. For a long time, under their noted chief Moses, they refused
to recognize the authority of the government or to go on a reservation.
Now, however, they are settled in Nespelim valley, on Colville
reservation. They were reported to number 390 in 1892 and are described
as “true, genuine Indians in every sense of the word.” Their chief,
Moses, the enemy and rival of Smohalla, was thus described in 1870:
“Moses, the head chief, has been a great warrior. He was foremost in
the fights of 1858 with Colonels Steptoe and Wright, and was severely
wounded a number of times, but not dying, the Indians believe he has a
charmed life. He is medium sized, about 45 years old, noble looking,
straight as an arrow, and never breaks his word. He has more influence
than any other chief east of the Cascade mountains in the territory.
He comes nearer being such a chief as we read of than any I have
ever met. He is kindly disposed toward the whites and invites them to
come and settle in his country.” (_Winans._) Linguistically they are
probably nearest related to the Piskwaus.

+Wa′napûm+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonyms_: Columbia River Indians,
Sokulks. This is the tribe of which Smohalla is the chief and high
priest. They are a small band, numbering probably less than 200 souls,
and closely connected linguistically and politically with the Yakima,
Pälus, and Nez Percés. Wanapûm is the name by which they are known to
these cognate tribes, and signifies “river people;” from _wana_ or
_wala_, “river” (particularly Columbia river), and _pûm_ or _pam_,
“people or tribal country.” Together with the other non-treaty tribes
of this region they are known to the whites under the indefinite name
of “Columbia River Indians.” They are identical with the Sokulk met by
Lewis and Clark at the mouth of Snake river and described as living
farther up on the Columbia. The name Sokulk seems to be entirely
unknown among the Yakima and Pälus of today. The Wa′napûm range along
both banks of the Columbia, in Washington, from above Crab creek down
to the mouth of Snake river. Their village, where Smohalla resides, is
on the west bank of the Columbia, at the foot of Priest rapids, in the
Yakima country. It is called Pʿnä, signifying “a fish weir,” and is a
great rendezvous for the neighboring tribes during the salmon fishing
season. Haying never made a treaty or gone on a reservation, they are
not officially recognized by the government.

+Pä′lus+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonyms_: Palouse, Pelloatpallah
Chopunnish (Lewis and Clark), Peloose, Polonches, Sewatpalla. The Pälus
owned the whole basin of Palouse river in Washington and Idaho, and
extended also along the north bank of Snake river to its junction with
the Columbia. They were, and are, closely connected with the Wanapûm
and the Nez Percés. Pälus, the name by which the tribe is commonly
known, is properly the name of Standing Rock, at the junction of
Palouse and Snake rivers. They can not explain the meaning. They have
four villages: Almotu, on the north bank of Snake river in Washington,
about 30 miles above the mouth of Palouse river; Pälus, on the north
bank of Snake river just below the junction of the Palouse; Ta′sawĭks,
on the north bank of Snake river about 15 miles above its mouth; and
Kasĭ′spä or Cosispa (meaning “at the point,” from _kăsĭ′s_, a point,
and _pä_, the locative), at Ainsworth in the junction of the Snake and
Columbia. This last village has a slight difference in dialect and is
sometimes regarded as belonging to the Wanapûm. Although the Pä′lus are
mentioned as parties to the Yakima treaty of 1855, they have never as
a tribe recognized any treaty limitations or come upon a reservation.
They are aboriginal in their ideas and among the most devoted adherents
of the Smohalla doctrine. They were estimated at 500 in 1854, but, not
being officially recognized, it is impossible to give their present
number.

+Pĭskwaus+ or +Winä′tshipûm+ (Salishan stock).—_Synonyms_: Piscaous,
Piscous, Pisquose. The name by which this tribe is commonly known
is properly the name of a fishing place on Wenatchee river, and is
probably Salishan, but may be from the Yakima _pĭsko_, signifying “a
bend in the river.” The Yakima call the river Winätshi, signifying a
“river issuing from a cañon,” and the tribe Winätshipûm. The Piskwaus
proper, on Wenatchee river, with their connected bands or tribes living
in the same neighborhood, west of the Columbia in Kittitas and Okanogan
counties, Washington, are a southern extension of the Mitaui and speak
the same language. Under the name of Piskwaus, Stevens includes “the
Indians on the Columbia between the Priests’ and Ross rapids, on the
Pisquose or Winatshapam river; the Enteatkeon, Chelaun lake, and the
Mithaw on Barrier river. The name of Pisquouse, however, properly
refers to a single locality on the river known to the Yakamas as
Winatshapam. The Pisquouse themselves, as has before been remarked, are
so much intermarried with the Yakamas that they have almost lost their
nationality. These bands were formerly all united under one principal
chief, Stalkoosum, who is said to have been a man of great note among
them. He was killed a few years since in a fight with the Blackfeet,
since which there has been no head of the tribe.” (_Stevens, Comr.
Rept., 1854._) The Piskwaus and smaller connected tribes took part in
the Yakima treaty of 1855, but do not live on the reservation. Most
of them live on the Wenatchee and the north branch of Yakima river in
Kittitas county. They are all Catholics. There is no official statement
of their number. Smaller tribes or bands connected with the Piskwaus
proper and speaking the same language are:

1. +K̔′tătäs+, K̔tătäs-‛lĕ′ma, Ketetas (Stevens), Pshwa′năpûm (Yakima
name), Shanwappoms (Lewis and Clark). K̔′tătäs signifies “a shoal,”
_‘lĕ′ma_ being a tribal suffix, and Pshwană-pûm in the Yakima language
signifies “shoal people,” the name referring to a shoal in Yakima river
at Ellensburg.

2. +Ska′utăl+, or Skaddal (of Lewis and Clark). About Boston creek and
Kahchass lake, at the head of Yakima river.

3. +W‛shä′nătu+, or Shallattoos (of Lewis and Clark). The word means
“huckleberry” in Yakima, and is applied to a site on Yakima river just
above Ellensburg.

4. +Skwa′nănă+, or Squannaroos (of Lewis and Clark). A Yakima word
meaning “whirlpool,” and applied to a point on Yakima river about
opposite the entrance of Selah creek, the village being on the west
bank of the river. This band may possibly speak the language of the
Ätanûm, a Shahaptian tribe, whose territory adjoins them.

5. +Qamĭl-‘lĕma+ or Kahmiltpah. The name is Yakima, and signifies
“people of Qamĭ′lh.” Qamĭ′lh, or “Watching for Fish,” was a chief who
formerly lived with his band about Saddle mountain, on the east side of
the Columbia, above Priest rapids. They are called Kahmiltpah in the
Yakima treaty of 1855. They now live with the other tribes last named
in Kittitas county.

6. +Si′ăpkat+ or Seapcat. They reside now in Kittitas county, but
probably lived originally at a place of the same name on the east bank
of the Columbia, about Bishop rock and Milk creek, below Wenatchee
river. They are called Seapcat in the Yakima treaty of 1855. The word
is of the Piskwaus language.

+Yä′kĭmâ+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonyms_: Cutsahnim (Lewis and Clark),
Eyackimah, Pa′‛kiut-‛lĕ′ma, Stobshaddat (by Puget sound tribes,
_Tolmie_), Waptai′lmĭm, Yackamans, Yookoomans. The Yakima are the most
important tribe of the Shahaptian stock, excluding the Nez Percés.
They occupied the country of Natchess and middle Yakima rivers, in
the present Yakima county, Washington, and are now on a reservation
within the same county. Stevens says the name signifies “black bear”
in the Wallawalla language, but Yakima informants state that it is a
nickname signifying “coward” or “runaway,” and say that the proper
name of the tribe is Waptai′lmĭm, people of the “narrow river,” or
Pa′‛kiut-‛lĕ′ma, “people of the gap,” both names referring to the
narrows in Yakima river at Union gap, near Yakima bridge. Their old
village was on the west side of the river, just below the gap. They
are the Cutsahnim of Lewis and Clark. This name may possibly come from
the same root as Kû′tsano′t, “Lying Alongside,” the name of an old
Yakima chief who died about 1880. In 1854, according to Stevens, they
were “divided into two principal bands, each made up of a number of
villages and very closely connected, the one owning the country on the
Natchess and lower Yakima, the other on the Wenass and its main branch
above the forks.” These latter, however, were chiefly of the Piskwaus
connection. They had then several chiefs, of whom Kamaiakan was the
most important. Like all the other Columbia tribes east of the Cascade
range, they formerly crossed the Rocky mountains annually to hunt the
buffalo on the waters of the Missouri. In 1855 the government made a
treaty with the Yakima, Piskwaus, Pälus, and other tribes by which
they were to cede a territory on both sides of the Columbia, extending
generally from the Cascade range eastward to Palouse and Snake rivers,
and southward from above Chelan lake to the Columbia, excepting a small
portion between the Columbia and the lower Yakima. At the same time
the Yakima reservation was established and an arrangement was made
by which all the tribes and bands concerned were to be confederated
under the title of the “Yakama Nation,” with Kamaiakan as head chief.
Shortly afterward the Yakima war broke out, and the treaty remained
unratified until 1859. As already stated, the Pälus and several other
tribes have never recognized it or come on the reservation, and their
objection to such removal has become a religious principle of the
Smohalla doctrine. In the original treaty of 1855 fourteen tribes are
named as participating, as follows: Yakama (Yäkima), Palouse (Pä′lus),
Pisquouse (Pi′skwaus), Wenatshapam (another name for Piskwaus),
Klikatat (Klûkatät), Klinquit (not identified), Kowwassayee (K′kasawi),
Liaywas (not identified), Skinpah (Skinpä), Wish-ham (Wushqûm), Shyiks
(not identified), Ochechotes (Uchi′chol), Kahmiltpah (Qamil′lĕma), and
Seapcat (Si′apkat). Among these were represented at least six languages
and three linguistic stocks. The majority of these Indians west of the
Columbia, including the Yakima proper and others on the reservation,
are Catholics, with also a number of adherents of the Shaker and
Smohalla doctrines. Those on the reservation numbered 1,200 in 1892,
with an estimated 1,500 outside the boundaries. Beside the principal
band of Yakima, the Waptailmĭm already mentioned, there are also the
Sĕ′tăs-‛lĕma, or “people of the rye prairie,” on Setass creek, a
western tributary of the Yakima in the eastern part of the reservation,
and the Pĭsko, or people of the “river bend,” in a village also on the
south side of the Yakima, between Topinish and Setass creeks. (See
_Pishquitpah_.) Their dialects are said to differ slightly from that of
the Waptailmĭm.

+Ä′tănûm-‛lĕma+ (Shahaptian stock) or “people (_‛lĕma_) of Ätanûm
creek.”—A small tribe on Atahnam creek, in Yakima county, Washington,
on the northern boundary of the reservation. They are said to speak a
language distinct from Yakima or Klûkatät, but cognate. They have no
official recognition now or in the treaty of 1855. The name Ä′tănûm is
Yakima, and refers to a stream “ascended” (by salmon).

+Klû’kătät+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonyms_: Clickahut, Clickitat,
Klikatat, Qwû′lh-hwai-pûm, Weyehhoo, Whulwhypum. The name by which
this tribe is commonly known is from the Wasko language and signifies
“beyond (the mountain)”—that is, east of the Cascade range—with
reference to the Chinookan tribes on the lower Columbia. The same
name was also at times extended to the Yakima. They call themselves
Qwûlh-hwai-pûm, “prairie people;” from _qwûlh-hwai_, “prairie,” and
_pûm_, “people,” referring particularly to their occupancy of Camass
prairie. They formerly occupied the southern slopes of Mount Adams
and Mount Helens, with the country of Klikatat and Lewis rivers, in
the present Klickitat and Skamania counties, Washington. East of them
were the Yakima and west were the Salishan and Chinookan tribes. At
one time they lived farther east, but were driven west by the Cayuse.
(_Stevens._) About sixty years ago they crossed the Columbia and
overran the Willamet country, and even penetrated as far south as the
Umpqua, but afterward withdrew again to their proper country. Although
but a small tribe, they were aggressive and enterprising and were the
trade medium between the tribes west of the mountains and those east.
They joined in the Yakima treaty of 1855 and are now chiefly on Yakima
reservation, but a few are still on White Salmon river, in Klickitat
county. Their number is unknown. The Taitinapam and Topinish speak the
same language and may be considered as branches of this tribe.

+Qa′pnĭsh-‛lĕma+ or +Topinish+ (Shahaptian stock).—A small tribe
on Topinish river in Yakima county, Washington, within the present
limits of the reservation. They speak the Klûkatät language. The name
signifies “people (_‛lĕma_) of the trail coming from the foot of the
hill.”

+Taitinapam+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonym_: Tai-kie-a-pain (misprint).
A small tribe speaking the Klûkatät language, formerly living on the
western slopes of the Cascade mountains, between the heads of Lewis and
Cowlitz rivers, in Skamania county, Washington, being the westernmost
tribe of Shahaptian stock. If any are left, they are probably
incorporated with the Klûkatät on Yakima reservation. They never had
official recognition.

+Chämnä′pûm+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonyms_: Chimnahpum, Chimnapoos,
Cuimnapum. A tribe which occupied the bend of the Columbia below Yakima
river, together with the country on the lower Yakima, chiefly in the
present Yakima county, Washington. They are the Chimnahpum of Lewis and
Clark, and speak a dialect of the language of the Pä′lus and Wanapûm,
with which tribes the few survivors are incorporated. A few are also
still living on the west side of the Columbia, opposite Pasco. The name
is of their own language and means “people (_pûm_) of Chämnä′,” their
old village about opposite Wallula.

+Pishquitpah+ (Shahaptian stock).—This name occurs only in the
narrative of Lewis and Clark as that of a tribe in 1805, “residing
at the Muscleshell rapid and on the north side of the Columbia to
the commencement of the high country, wintering on the borders of
the Tapteal.” The Tapteal (properly Waptail or Waptailmĭm) is Yakima
river. This would locate them in eastern Klickitat and Yakima counties,
Washington. They are probably identical with the Pĭsko band of the
Yakima. In the name Pishquitpah the final _pah_ is the Yakima or Pä′lus
locative _pä_, “at.”

+K̔ka′săwi+ or +Kowwassayee+ (Shahaptian stock).—A small tribe speaking
the Tenino language and formerly occupying a village of the same name,
K̔ka′săwi, on the north bank of the Columbia, in Klickitat county,
Washington, about opposite the mouth of the Umatilla. The full name is
K̔ka′săwi-‛lĕ′ma, “people (_‛lĕma_) of the arrow-making place,” the
local form being from _k̔ka′so_, “arrow.” They took part in the Yakima
treaty of 1855 under the name of Kowwassayee, and are now on Yakima
reservation.

+Hăhau′pûm+ or +Wahowpum+ (Shahaptian stock).—A small tribe speaking
the Tenino language and occupying a village, Hăha′u, on the north bank
of the Columbia, about the mouth of Olive creek, in Klickitat county,
Washington. The word means “willow people,” from _hăha′u_, a species of
willow, and _pûm_, “people.” They are the Wahowpum of Lewis and Clark.
They have never had official recognition.

+Uchi′chol+ or +Ochechotes+ (Shahaptian stock).—A small tribe speaking
the Tenino language, living now, or formerly, on the north bank of
the Columbia in Klickitat county, Washington. They are mentioned as
Ochechotes in the Yakima treaty of 1855, and may now be incorporated
with other tribes on Yakima reservation. The name, from the Tenino
language, signifies the “hind dorsal-fin” (of a salmon), and is the
name of a rock on the north side of the Columbia, opposite the upper
end of the island, at the mouth of the Des Chutes. See _Tapänäsh_.

+Skĭ′npä+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonyms_: Sawpaw (?), Skien, Skin,
Skinpah. A small tribe speaking the Tenino language and formerly having
a village on the north bank of the Columbia in Klickitat county,
Washington, at the falls opposite Celilo. They took part in the Yakima
treaty of 1855 under the name of Skinpah, and are now incorporated
with the other tribes on Yakima reservation. The name is Tenino, and
means “cradle place,” or “at the cradle,” from _skĭn_, “cradle,” and
_pä_, the locative, and refers to a prominent rock at the site of
their former village having some resemblance to an Indian cradle. See
_Tapänäsh_.

+Täpanä′sh+ or +Eneeshur+ (Shahaptian stock).—A small tribe speaking
the Tenino language, having a village on the north bank of the Columbia
in Klickitat county, Washington, about opposite the mouth of Des
Chutes river and a little above Celilo. The name is identical with
the Eneeshur of Lewis and Clark, these explorers in 1805 having also
included under this name the various bands speaking the Tenino language
on both sides of the Columbia about the mouth of the Des Chutes. The
Tapänäsh have no official recognition. See _Tenino_.

+Tlaqluit+ or +Wŭshqûm+ (Chinookan stock).—_Synonyms_: Echebool,
Echeloot, Eloot, Helwit, Niculuita, Ouichram, Tchilouit, Tilhulhwit,
Wisham, Wishham, Wishram, Wisswham. The Tlaqluit, with the Wasko, are
the easternmost tribes of Chinookan stock on the Columbia, having
immediately above them the Shahaptian tribes, speaking the Tenino
language. The Tlaqluit territory lies along the north bank of the
Columbia in Klickitat county, Washington, from Tenino, about 6 miles
above The Dalles, down to the neighborhood of White Salmon river.
They call themselves Tlaqluit (Echeloot of Lewis and Clark), and are
called Wŭshqûmă-pûm, or “Wŭshqûm people,” by the tribes speaking the
Tenino language, Wŭshqûm being the name of their chief village near
South Side at The Dalles, the great fishing and trading resort for
the tribes of this section. The name appears also as Wishram. Both
Tlaqluit and Wŭshqûm refer to a species of louse or flea abounding in
that neighborhood. They took part in the Yakima treaty of 1855 under
the name of Wishham, but most of them have probably never gone on the
reservation. See _Wasko_.

There is a tradition in the tribe that long before the coming of the
whites to the Columbia a band of Tlaqluit left their people on account
of a petty quarrel as to whether a goose made a certain noise with its
bill or with its wings, and went up the Columbia and the Spokane, and
are supposed to be now about the headwaters of the latter stream and
still retaining their language, although under a different tribal name.

+Chilû′ktkwa+ or +Chilluckittequaws+ (Chinookan stock).—A tribe
formerly extending along the north bank of the Columbia in Klickitat
and Skamania counties, Washington, from about White Salmon river down
to some distance below the Cascades. They are called Chilluckittequaws
in 1805 by Lewis and Clark, who speak also of a separate band of the
same tribe under the name of Smackshop, a name which can not now be
identified. The tribe now numbers less than 100. Until recently the
remnant lived about the mouth of White Salmon river, but removed about
thirteen years ago to the Cascades. Their language is nearly the same
as that of the Wasko. They have never had official recognition.

+Kwikwû′lĭt+ or +Dog River+ (Chinookan stock).—_Synonyms_: Cascade
Indians, Kigaltwalla, Upper Chinook, Wahclellah, Watlala. A small tribe
formerly living at the Cascades and about Dog river, a small stream
coming into the Columbia about half-way between the Cascades and The
Dalles, in Wasco county, Oregon. They are identical, in part at least,
with the Wahclellahs of Lewis and Clark (mentioned as a part of the
“Shahala nation”), and are the “Ki-gal-twal-la band of the Wascoes”
and the “Dog River band of the Wascoes” of the Wasco treaty of 1855.
The “Dog River or Cascade Indians” were reported to number 80 souls in
1854. In the next year they, with other tribes, entered into the Wasco
treaty, by which they agreed to remove to Warmspring reservation, where
some of them now are, while the others are still about the Cascades.
Their language is nearly the same as that of the Wasko.

+Wasko+ (Chinookan stock).—_Synonyms_: Dalles Indians, Wascopum. A
tribe formerly claiming the country about The Dalles, on the south
bank of the Columbia, in Wasco county, Oregon. They, with the Tlaqluit
on the opposite bank, are the easternmost extension of the Chinookan
stock, and speak the same language. The name is said to be a Tenino
word, meaning “grass,” or “grass people.” It has sometimes been made
to include several cognate bands about The Dalles and Cascades, on
both sides of the Columbia. Under the name of “The Dalles band of the
Wascoes,” they entered into the Wasco treaty of 1855, and are now on
Warmspring reservation in Oregon. They numbered 260 in 1892.

+Waiäm+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonyms_: (Lower) Des Chutes,
Waiäm-‛lĕma, Wayyampa, Wyam. A tribe speaking the Tenino language and
formerly living about the mouth of Des Chutes river, in the present
Wasco and Sherman counties, Oregon. Their chief village was on the
Columbia where Celilo now is, and was called Waiäm, whence their
name of Waiäm-‛lĕma or “people of Waiäm.” They joined in the Wasco
treaty of 1855 under the name of “Wyam or Lower Des Chutes band of
Walla-Wallas,” and are now on Warmspring reservation in Oregon. Their
number is not separately reported.

+Tai′-ăq+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonyms_: Taigh, Ta-ih, Tairtla, Tyich.
A tribe speaking the Tenino language and formerly occupying the country
about Tygh and White rivers, in Wasco county, Oregon. The name Tai′-ăq
refers to the stream and denotes “muddy, white water.” They took part
in the Wasco treaty of 1855 under the name of “Ta-ih or Upper Des
Chutes band of Walla-Wallas,” and are now on Warmspring reservation,
Oregon. Their number is not reported.

+Tĭ‛lqûni+ (Shahaptian stock).—A tribe formerly claiming the country
between Tygh valley and Warmspring river, west of Des Chutes river,
in the present Wasco county, Oregon. They are now on Warmspring
reservation, in the same neighborhood. They have never been officially
mentioned under their Indian name, and may be considered the Warmspring
proper, although this name is local rather than tribal. They speak the
Tenino language. See _Tenino_.

+Tenino+ or +Mĕli′-‛lĕma+ (Shahaptian stock).—The most important
Shahaptian tribe of western Oregon. They formerly occupied middle Des
Chutes river, and conquered the present Warmspring reservation from the
Paiute or Snake tribes, but never occupied it until put there by the
Wasco treaty of 1855. Since then they have been known indiscriminately
as Tenino or Warmspring Indians, although this latter designation is
commonly used to include other cognate tribes on the same reservation.
For this reason it is impossible to give their number definitely. The
Tenino language, in various dialects, is spoken, excepting by the
Lohim, by all the tribes formerly living on both banks of the Columbia
and on its tributaries from the country of the Wasko about The Dalles
up to about the mouth of the Umatilla.

Most of this region, on the south or Oregon side of the Columbia,
was formerly held by Shoshonean tribes of Paiute connection, which
have been dispossessed by the Shahaptian tribes and driven farther
back to the south. The only Shoshonean tribe which maintained its
place on the Columbia was the Lohim, on Willow creek. The Tenino
themselves conquered the present Warmspring reservation from the
Snakes. The expulsion was in full progress when Lewis and Clark went
down the Columbia in 1805, but had been practically completed when
the first treaties were made with these tribes fifty years later.
Lewis and Clark state that “on that (the south) side of the river
none of the tribes have any permanent habitations, and on inquiry
we were confirmed in our belief that it was from the fear of being
attacked by the Snake Indians, with whom they are constantly at war.
This nation they represent as being very numerous and residing in a
great number of villages on the Towahnahiook (Wanwaui or Des Chutes),
where they live principally on salmon, ... the first villages of the
Snake Indians being twelve days’ journey on a course about southeast
of this place.” In the appendix, after mentioning various bands of
Snakes on Snake and Willamette rivers, they speak of the main body as
“residing in the fall and winter on the Multnomah (Willamet) river,
southward of the Southwest mountains, and in spring and summer near the
heads of the Towahnahiook (Des Chutes), Lepage (John Day), Yaumalolam
(Umatilla), and Wollawollah rivers, and especially at the falls of the
Towahnahiook, for the purpose of fishing.” In the Wasco treaty of 1855
the Shahaptian tribes were recognized as owners of the whole country
southward to the forty-fourth parallel, from the Cascade range east to
the Blue mountains. See _Tapänäsh_.

+Tûkspû′sh+ or +John Day Indians+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonyms_:
Dock-spus, John Day Rivers, Tûkspûsh-‛lĕma. A tribe speaking the Tenino
language and formerly living along the lower part of John Day river,
Oregon, having their principal village at the falls about 4 miles above
the mouth. They are now on Warmspring reservation, and numbered 59 in
1892, with perhaps others off the reservation. Tûkspûsh is the name of
John Day river in the Tenino language.

+Lohĭm+ or +Willow Creek Indians+ (Shoshonean stock).—A tribe living
on Willow creek, in Gilliam and Morrow counties, Oregon. They are
of Shoshonean connection, being the only Indians of this stock who
have been able to maintain their position on the Columbia against the
inroads of the Shahaptian tribes. They have never made a treaty with
the government, and are generally spoken of as renegades belonging to
the Umatilla reservation. In 1870 they were reported to number 114, but
are not mentioned in the recent official reports.

+Cayuse+ or +Wailĕ′tpu+ (Waiilatpuan stock).—_Synonyms_: Cailloux,
Kayuse, Shiwanish, Skyuse, Wailetma, Yeletpo Chopunnish (of Lewis and
Clark). The Cayuse are a warlike tribe of distinct stock formerly
occupying the mountain country on the heads of Wallawalla, Umatilla,
and Grande Ronde rivers in Oregon and Washington, including the present
Umatilla reservation. Further investigation may yet establish a
linguistic connection with the Shahaptian tribes. The Molala, formerly
on Molalla creek, west of the Cascades, are a separated band, of
whose western migration the Cayuse and their neighbors still have a
tradition. The Cayuse formerly bore a high reputation for intelligence
and bravery, but on account of their fighting propensities, which led
them to make constant war on the Snakes and other tribes to the west,
they were never very numerous. In 1838 a Presbyterian mission, called
Waiilatpu, had been established among the Cayuse, by Dr Whitman, where
now is the town of Whitman, in Wallawalla county, Washington. In 1847
the smallpox, before unknown among them, carried off a large part of
the tribe. The Cayuse, believing that the missionaries were the cause
of it, attacked the mission on November 29, 1847, killed Dr Whitman and
thirteen others, and destroyed the mission. As a matter of fact, there
seems little question that the infection was brought into the country
in supplies intended for the use of the mission or of emigrants
temporarily stopping there. In 1854, according to Stevens, “the tribe,
though still dreaded by their neighbors on account of their courage and
warlike spirit, is but a small one, numbering, according to the census
of 1851, only 126. Of these, individuals of the pure blood are few, the
majority being intermixed with the Nez Percés and the Wallah-Wallahs,
particularly with the former, to such a degree that their own language
has fallen into disuse.” A few years ago only a few individuals, then
living on Umatilla reservation, retained their old language. In 1855
they joined in the treaty by which Umatilla reservation in Oregon was
set apart, and most of those remaining are now there, while a few
others are with the Nez Percés at Lapwai. Joseph, the noted Nez Percé
chief, is himself the son of a Cayuse father. In 1892 the Cayuse on
Umatilla reservation were reported to number 391, but it is evident
that most of these are mixed-bloods of other tribes, particularly the
Umatilla. The name Cayuse is from the Nez Percé language. They call
themselves Wailĕtpu. They are known to the Yakima as Wi′alĕt-pûm or
Wai′lĕtma, and to the Tenino as Shiwanish, or “strangers from up the
river,” a name extended also to the Nez Percés.

+Umatilla+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonym_: Utilla. A tribe formerly
occupying the lower portion of the river of the same name, with the
adjacent bank of the Columbia, in Oregon. They speak a distinct
language of the Shahaptian stock. By the treaty of 1855 they agreed to
go on Umatilla reservation in Oregon, where in 1892 they were reported
to number 216. A large proportion of those now called Cayuse on the
same reservation are Umatilla mixed-bloods.

+Wallawalla+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonyms_: Oualla-Oualla, Walawaltz,
Wollawollah, Wollaw-Wollah. A tribe formerly occupying the country
about the lower portion of the river of the same name and along the
east bank of the Columbia from Snake river down nearly to the Umatilla,
in Washington and Oregon. They take their name from the river, the
word being said to refer to “rushing water.” Their language is said to
resemble closely that of the Nez Percés. By the treaty of 1855 they
agreed to go on Umatilla reservation, Oregon, where, in 1892, they were
reported to number 474.

A small band of the same tribe, known to the Yakima as Walu′la-pûm,
formerly lived on the west bank of the Columbia opposite the present
Wallula. Their dialect is said to have been more akin to the Pä′lus
language.

+Sahaptin+ or +Nez Percés+ (Shahaptian stock).—_Synonyms_: Chohoptins,
Chopunnish (Lewis and Clark), Copunnish, Laaptin (misprint),
Â′dal-k̔ato′igo, “people with hair cut across the forehead” (Kiowa
name), Shi′wanĭsh (Tenino name, applied also to the Cayuse),
Wa′pamĕtănt (Yakima name for the language). The Nez Percés are said
to call themselves Sahaptin, and were named Nez Percés, or “pierced
noses,” by the French from their former custom of wearing nose
pendants. They are the most important tribe of the Shahaptian stock,
and formerly occupied a large territory in eastern Washington and
Oregon and central Idaho, bounded on the east by the main divide of
the Bitterroot mountains, and including lower Grande Ronde and Salmon
rivers, with a large part of the Snake and all of the Clearwater.
The Wallowa valley, the disputed title to which led to the Nez Percé
war, lies on a branch of the Grande Ronde, in Oregon. They had the
Salishan tribes to the northeast, the Shoshonean tribes to the south,
and the Cayuse, Wallawalla, and Pälus, with all of whom they are much
intermarried, on the west and northwest. Almost all authorities give
them a high character for bravery, intelligence, and honorable conduct
traits which were strikingly displayed in the Nez Percé war.

Lewis and Clark traversed their country in 1805, and speak of them
and some connected tribes under the name of Chopunnish, distinguished
as follows: Chopunnish nation (about the present Lapwai reservation),
Pelloatpallah band (the Pälus), Kimooenim band (on Snake river, between
the Salmon and the Clearwater), Yeletpo band (the Cayuse), Willewah
band (in Wallowa valley, afterward Joseph’s band), Soyennom band (on
the north side of the upper Clearwater, in Idaho; these were really a
part of the Pälus—the proper form is Tätqu′nma, whence Thatuna hills,
referring to “a fawn” in the Pälus language, and was the name applied
to their kamas ground about Camass creek), Chopunnish of Lewis river
(on Snake river, below the Clearwater). In response to a request from
the Nez Percés, who sent a delegation all the way to Saint Louis for
that purpose in 1832, the first Protestant mission was established
among them at Lapwai, Idaho, in 1837. Soon afterward they entered into
relations with the government, and made their first treaty with the
United States in 1855. By this treaty they ceded the greater portion of
their territory, and were confirmed in the possession of a reservation
including Wallowa valley. On the discovery of gold in the country,
however, the miners rushed in, and in consequence a new treaty was made
in 1863, by which they gave up all but the present Lapwai reservation
in Idaho. Joseph, who occupied Wallowa valley with his band, refused
to recognize this treaty or remove to Lapwai. This refusal finally led
to the Nez Percé war in 1877, as already related. The main body of the
tribe took no part in the war. After the surrender of Joseph his band
was removed to Indian Territory, where the mortality among them was so
great that in 1884 they were returned to the northwest. For several
reasons, however, it was deemed unadvisable to settle them in the
neighborhood of their old home, and a place was finally found for them
in 1887 on Colville reservation in northern Washington. In 1892 there
were 1,828 on Lapwai reservation and 138 on Colville reservation, a
total population of 1,966.




                            +Chapter VIII+

                      THE SHAKERS OF PUGET SOUND

  My breath was out and I died. All at once I saw a great shining
  light. Angels told me to look back. I did, and saw my own body
  lying dead. It had no soul. My soul left my body and went up to the
  judgment place of God.... My soul was told that I must come back
  and live on earth. When I came back, I told my friends, “There is a
  God. My good friends, be Christians. If you all try hard and help
  me, we shall be better men on earth.”—_John Slocum._


In 1881 there originated among the tribes of Puget sound in Washington
a new religion, which, although apparently not founded on any doctrinal
prophecy, yet deserves special attention for the prominent part which
hypnotism holds in its ceremonial. Indeed, there is good reason to
believe that the Paiute messiah himself, and through him all the
apostles of the Ghost dance, have obtained their knowledge of hypnotic
secrets from the “Shakers” of Puget sound.

[Illustration: +Fig. 67+—John Slocum and Louis Yowaluch.]

The founder of the religion is Squ-sacht-un, known, to the whites as
John Slocum. He is now (1896) about 58 years of age. His chief high
priest is Louis Yowaluch, or Ai-yäl as he is called by the Yakima.
Both are of the Squaxin tribe. In 1881 (Eells makes it 1882) he “died”
or fell into a trance one morning about daylight and remained in
that condition until the middle of the afternoon, when he awoke and
announced that he had been to heaven, but had been met at the entrance
by angels, who forbade him to enter on account of his wickedness, and
gave him his choice either to go to hell or return to earth and teach
his people what they must do to get to heaven. Accordingly, he came
back to earth and began his divinely appointed mission, introducing
into the new doctrine and ritual a great deal of what he had learned
from the white missionaries. From the nervous twitchings which so
peculiarly distinguished them, his followers soon became known as
“Shakers.” Although strongly opposed by the agent, who arrested and
imprisoned the leaders and visited various minor penalties on their
followers, the Shaker religion grew and flourished until it now has a
regular organization with several houses of worship, and has received
the official indorsement of the Presbyterian church.

The following account of the system, in response to a letter of
inquiry, was obtained from the missionary, Reverend Myron Eells,
brother of the agent:

  A curious phase of religion sprang up in the fall of 1882 among
  some of the Indians on the southern part of Puget sound. It has
  prevailed mainly among the Squaxon, Nisqually, Skokomish, and
  Chehalis Indians, and has been called by its opponents the “Shake
  religion,” and its followers have been called “Shakers” on account
  of a large amount of nervous shaking which is a part of the form
  of its observance. It is evidently based upon about the same
  principles of the mind as the jerks and shouting at camp meetings
  among the whites of the southern and western states fifty years
  ago, when they were more ignorant and less acquainted with real
  religion than they are now. When superstition, ignorance, dreams,
  imagination, and religion are all mingled together, either among
  whites, Indians, or people of any other race, they produce a
  strange compound. It has proven so in this case.

  In the fall of 1882 an Indian named John Slocum, who was living on
  Skookum bay, in Mason county, apparently died. Some years previous
  he had lived on the Skokomish reservation, where he had attended
  a Protestant church, and had learned something of the white man’s
  religion, God, Jesus Christ, and the morals inculcated. He had
  also learned something in his early life of the Catholic religion
  and its forms and ceremonies. Many Indians were present when he
  was sick and apparently died. They said his neck was broken, and
  that he remained dead for about six hours, when he returned to
  life, jumped up, and ran off a short distance, and soon began to
  converse with the people. Whether or not it was a case of suspended
  animation is a question. A white man, a near neighbor of his, who
  saw him before his apparent death, while he thus lay, and after his
  resuscitation, said he believed the Indian was “playing possum.”
  But the Indians believed that he really died and rose again.

  The Indian stated that he died and attempted to go to heaven, but
  could not enter it because he was so wicked. He was there told,
  however, the way of life, and that he must return to this earth and
  teach his people the way, and induce them to become Christians. He
  gained a small band of followers, a church was built for him, and
  he steadily preached to the people.

  Affairs went on this way until the next August. Then, after
  consultation with other Indians who favored him, especially on the
  Skokomish reservation, it was decided to hold a big meeting. The
  Indians of the surrounding region were called to go. They were told
  that they would be lost if they did not; that four women would be
  turned into angels; that persons would die and be raised to life
  again, and that other wonderful things would be done.

  Many went, about half of those on the Skokomish reservation being
  among the number, and they did hold a big meeting. Women did go
  around trying to fly like angels; four persons are said to have
  died, and, with the power which was said to have been given them
  from above, others were said to have brought them back to life
  again. This was a mixture of trying to perform miracles, as in
  Bible times, to prove the divinity of their religion, and some
  of the ceremonies of their old black _tomahnous_. This was a
  secret society of their savage days, in which persons went into a
  hypnotic condition, in which they became very rigid, and out of
  which they came in the course of time. The followers of this new
  religion dreamed dreams, saw visions, went through some disgusting
  ceremonies a la mode the black _tomahnous_, and were taken with
  a kind of shaking. With their arms at full length, their hands
  and arms would shake so fast that a common person not under the
  excitement could hardly shake half as fast. Gazing into the
  heavens, their heads would also shake very fast, sometimes for a
  few minutes and sometimes for hours, or half the night. They would
  also brush each other with their hands, as they said, to brush off
  their sins, for they said they were much worse than white people,
  the latter being bad only in their hearts, while the Indians were
  so bad that the badness came to the surface of their bodies and the
  ends of their finger nails, so that it could be picked off. They
  sometimes brushed each other lightly, and sometimes so roughly that
  the person brushed was made black for a week, or even sick.

  In connection with this they held church services, prayed to God,
  believed in Christ as a savior, said much about his death, and used
  the cross, their services being a combination of Protestant and
  Catholic services, though at first they almost totally rejected the
  Bible, for they said they had direct revelations from Christ, and
  were more fortunate than the whites, who had an old, antiquated
  book.

  After having kept up this meeting for about a week, they disbanded
  and went to their homes, but did not stop their shaking or
  services. They sometimes held meetings from 6 oclock in the evening
  until about midnight, lighting candles and putting them on their
  heads for a long time. They became very peculiar about making the
  sign of the cross many times a day, when they began to eat as they
  asked a blessing, and when they finished their meal and returned
  thanks; when they shook hands with anyone—and they shook hands
  very often—when they went to church and prayer meeting on Thursday
  evening, and at many other times, far more often than the Catholics
  do.

  On the Skokomish reservation their indiscretions caused the death
  of a mother and her child, and an additional loss of time and
  property to the amount of $600 or $800 in a few weeks. It also
  became a serious question whether the constant shaking of their
  heads would not make some of them crazy, and from symptoms and
  indications it was the opinion of the agency physician, J. T.
  Martin, that it would do so. Accordingly, on the reservation the
  authority of the agent was brought to bear, and to a great extent
  the shaking was stopped, though they were encouraged to keep on
  in the practice of some good habits which they had begun, of
  ceasing gambling, intemperance, their old style incantations over
  the sick, and the like. Some at first said they could not stop
  shaking, but that at their prayer meetings and church services on
  the Sabbath their hands and heads would continue to shake in spite
  of themselves; but after a short time, when the excitement had died
  away, they found that they could stop.

  But about Skookum bay, Mud bay, and Squaxon the shaking continued,
  and it spread to the Nisqually and Chehalis Indians. It seemed
  to be as catching, to use the expression of the Indians, as the
  measles. Many who at first ridiculed it and fought against it,
  and invoked the aid of the agent to stop it, were drawn into it
  after a little, and then they became its strong upholders. This
  was especially true of the medicine-men, or Indian doctors, and
  those who had the strongest faith in them. The Shakers declared
  that all the old Indian religion, and especially the cure of the
  sick by the medicine-men, was from the devil, and they would have
  nothing to do with it, those who at first originated and propagated
  it having been among the more intelligent and progressive of the
  uneducated Indians. Very few of those who had learned to read and
  had been in Sabbath school for a considerable length of time were
  drawn into it. It was the class between the most educated and the
  most superstitious who at first upheld it. They seemed to know
  too much to continue in the old-style religious ceremonies, but
  not to know enough and to be too superstitious to fully believe
  the Bible. Consequently, the medicine-men were at first bitterly
  opposed to it. About this time, however, an order came from the
  Indian department to stop all medicine-men from practicing their
  incantations over the sick. As a respectable number of the Indians
  had declared against the old style of curing the sick, it seemed
  to be a good time to enforce this order, as there was sufficient
  popular opinion in connection with the authority of the agent
  to enforce it. This was done, and then the medicine-men almost
  entirely joined the Shakers, as their style was more nearly in
  accordance with the old style than with the religion of the Bible.

  As it spread, one Indian went so far as to declare himself to be
  Christ again come to earth, and rode through the streets of Olympia
  at the head of several scores of his followers with his hands
  outstretched as Christ was when he was crucified. But he was so
  ridiculed by other Indians and by the whites that he gave up this
  idea and simply declared himself to be a prophet who had received
  revelations from heaven.

  For several years there has been very little of the shaking or this
  mode of worship among the Indians on the reservation, excepting
  secretly when persons were sick. Still, their native superstition
  and their intercourse with those off the reservation, who sometimes
  hold a special gathering and meeting when their followers grow cold
  and careless, has kept the belief in it as a religion firm in their
  hearts, so that lately, since they have become citizens, and are
  hence more free from the authority of the agent, the practice of it
  has become more common, especially when persons are sick.

  In fact, while it is a religion for use at all times, yet it is
  practiced especially over the sick, and in this way takes the
  place of the medicine-men and their methods. Unlike the system
  of the medicine-men, it has no single performer. Though often
  they select for leader one who can pray the best, yet in his
  absence another may take the lead. Like the old system, it has
  much noise. Especially do they use bells, which are rung over the
  person where the sickness is supposed to be. The others present
  use their influence to help in curing the sick one, and so imitate
  the attendants on an Indian doctor, getting down upon their knees
  on the floor and holding up their hands, with a candle in each
  hand, sometimes for an hour. They believe that by so holding up
  their hands the man who is ringing the bell will get the sickness
  out more easily than he otherwise would. They use candles both
  when they attempt to cure the sick and in their general service,
  eschewing lamps for fear of being easily tempted, as they believe
  coal-oil lights to be from Satan.

  In another point also this resembles very closely their old
  religion. For a long time before a person is taken sick they
  foretell that his spirit is gone to heaven and profess to be able
  to bring it back and restore it to him, so that he will not die
  as soon as he otherwise would. This was also a part of the old
  _tomahnous_ belief.

  They have also prophesied very much. Several times when a person
  has died they have told me that someone had foretold this event,
  but they have never told me this until after the event happened,
  except in one case. They have prophesied much in regard to the end
  of the world and the day of judgment. Generally, the time set has
  been on a Fourth of July, and many have been frightened as the
  time drew near, but, alas, in every instance the prophecy failed.
  Like Christians, they believe in a Supreme Being, in prayer,
  the sabbath, in heaven and hell, in man as a sinner, and Christ
  as a savior, and the system led its followers to stop drinking,
  gambling, betting, horse racing, the use of tobacco, and the
  old-style incantations over the sick. Of late years, however, some
  of them have fallen from grace.

  It has been a somewhat strange freak of human nature, a
  combination of morals and immorals, of Protestantism, Catholicism,
  and old Indian practices, of dreams and visions—a study in
  mental philosophy, showing what the mind may do under certain
  circumstances. Yet it is all easily accounted for. These Indians
  have mingled with the whites for a long time, nearly ever since
  most of them were small. All classes of whites have made sport of
  their religion—the infidel, the profane man, the immoral one, the
  moral one, and the Christian—and they have been told that God and
  the Bible were against it, consequently they lost faith in it. But
  the Indian must have some religion. He can not do without one. They
  were not ready to accept the Bible in all its purity. They wanted
  more excitement. Like the Dakota Indians more recently, they saw
  that Christ was the great center of the most powerful religion of
  the most powerful, intelligent, successful, and wisest nations with
  whom they came in contact. Consequently they formulated a system
  for themselves that would fill all their required conditions, and
  when a few leaders had originated it, a large share of the rest
  were ripe to accept it, but having had more Christian teaching
  than the wild Dakotas, it took a somewhat different form, with no
  thought of war and with more of real Christianity.

James Wickersham, esquire, of Tacoma, Washington, the well-known
historian of that region, is the regular attorney for these people as
a religious organization, and is consequently in a position to speak
with authority concerning them. In reply to a letter of inquiry, he
states that the Shakers believe in an actual localized heaven and hell,
and reverence the Bible, but regard John Slocum’s revelations as of
more authority. “They practice the strictest morality, sobriety, and
honesty. Their 500 or 600 members are models, and it is beyond question
that they do not drink whisky, gamble, or race, and are more free
from vice than any other church. They practice a mixture of Catholic,
Presbyterian, and old Indian ceremonies, and allow only Indians in the
church. They have five churches, built by themselves, and the sect is
growing quite rapidly.” From all this it would appear that the Shaker
religion is a distinct advance as compared with the old Indian system.

Under date of December 5, 1892, Mr Wickersham wrote again on this
subject, as follows:

  I read your letter to my Indian friends, and they beg me to
  write you and explain that they are not Ghost dancers, and have
  no sympathy with that ceremony or any other founded on the
  Dreamer religion. That they believe in heaven as do the orthodox
  Christians; also in Christ, and God, the Father of all; that they
  believe in future rewards and punishments, but not in the Bible
  particularly. They do believe in it as a history, but they do not
  value it as a book of revelation. They do not need it, for John
  Slocum personally came back from a conference with the angels at
  the gates of heaven, and has imparted to them the actual facts and
  the angelic words of the means of salvation.

  This testimony is even better than the words of Christ contained
  in the Bible, for John Slocum comes 1800 years nearer; he is an
  Indian, and personally appears to them and in Indian language
  reports the facts. These people believe Slocum as firmly as the
  martyr at the stake believed in that for which he offered up his
  life; but it is the Christian religion which they believe, and not
  the Ghost dance or Dreamer religion.

  In short, they have a mixture of Catholic, Protestant, and Indian
  ceremonies, with a thorough belief in John Slocum’s personal visit
  to heaven, and his return with a mission to save the Indians and
  so guide them that they, too, shall reach the realms of bliss.
  Personally, I think they are honest, but mistaken; but the belief
  certainly has beneficial effect, and has reduced drinking and crime
  to a minimum among the members of the “Shaker” or “Tschaddam”
  church.

  In conclusion, permit me to say that the general assembly of the
  Presbyterian church in this state has several times examined into
  the religion and character of the Shaker or Slocum church, and
  has highly indorsed its people and their character and actions.
  Yowaluch is their head now, and the strongest man mentally among
  them.

Some months later Mr Wickersham forwarded a circumstantial and
carefully written statement of the history and present condition of the
movement. In accordance with his request, we publish it as written,
omitting only some paragraphs which do not bear directly on the general
subject. It may be considered as an official statement of the Shaker
case by their legally constituted representative. As might have been
expected, he takes direct issue with those who have opposed the new
religion. The reader will note the recurrence of the Indian sacred
number, four, in Slocum’s speech, as also the fact that his first
trance was the culmination of a serious illness.


                    _Tschaddam or Shaker religion_

“On Christmas day, 1854, a treaty was signed at the mouth of Shenahnam
or Medicine creek, on the south side of Puget sound, Washington,
between Isaac I. Stevens, governor and ex officio superintendent of
Indian affairs for the United States, and the chief and headmen of the
Nisqually, Puyallup, and other small tribes of Indians residing around
the south shores of Puget sound.”

“One of these small tribes was the Squaxin, situated on the
southwestern branch or arm of Puget sound, now known as Little Skookum
bay, in Mason county, Washington, near Olympia. The remaining members
of this tribe yet live on the old home places, having purchased small
tracts of their old hunting grounds from the first settlers; and they
now make a living by fishing and gathering oysters as in days of old.
Of the fishy tribe of Squaxin was born John Slocum, as he is known to
the ‘Boston man,’ but to his native friends he is known as Squ-sacht-un.”

“John Slocum, Squ-sacht-un, is now (1893) about 51 years of age,
about 5 feet 8 inches high, and weighs about 160 pounds; rather stoop
shouldered, with a scattering beard, a shock of long black hair, a
flat head (fashionably flat, and produced by pressure while a baby),
bright eyes, but in all rather a common expression of countenance.
He is modest and rather retiring, but has unquestioned confidence in
himself and his mission. He is married, and up to the time of his
translation was looked on as a common Indian, with a slight inclination
to fire-water and pony racing, as well as a known fondness for Indian
gambling.”

“In the month of October, 1881, Slocum was unaccountably drawn to think
of his evil courses. While in the woods he knelt and prayed to God, and
began seriously to think of the error of his ways and of the evil days
that had fallen on his few remaining native friends. Whisky, gambling,
idleness, and general vice had almost exterminated his people. His
eyes were opened to the folly of these facts, and he prayed. He,
however, became sick; and as his sickness increased, these ideas became
brighter in his mind and his duty more clear. He grew worse, and one
day he died. He was pronounced dead by all present, and was laid out
for burial. His brother went to Olympia for a coffin, and a grave was
prepared. He died at 4 oclock in the morning, and late in the afternoon
he again resumed life and recovered consciousness.”

“His recovery was rapid, and immediately he told those present that
during his term of death his soul had been to heaven, where it had been
met by the angels, who, after a proper inquiry as to his name, etc.,
told him that he had been bad on earth, and reminded him very forcibly
of his shortcomings while there, and finally wound up by informing him
that he could not enter heaven, but that he could either go to hell or
could go back to the earth and preach to the Indians and tell them the
way to heaven. He accepted this latter proposition, and the result was
that his soul again returned to earth, reentered its old body, and has
from that day to this animated Slocum with the spirit of a crusader
against gambling, whisky drinking, and other ‘Boston’ vices.”

“About a year ago I was employed by these people as their attorney, and
at their request attended the meetings in Mason county, and had a long
conference with them. As a practical person would, Slocum undertook
to demonstrate to me his honesty and the divine character of their
religion, and at a large meeting composed only of Indians, members
of his church, he made to me a long public statement of facts, and
explained, through an interpreter, the character of their religion and
of their belief. I wrote down at the time a synopsis of what was said
to me, and now quote it at some length as being the exact words of
Slocum, and as the best explanation of their religion.”

“Standing before all his people, in the most solemn and impressive
manner, in their church, he said in substance:”

  “The witnesses have spoken the truth. I was sick about two weeks,
  and had five Indian doctors. I grew very weak and poor. Dr Jim was
  there. He could not cure me. They wanted to save me, but my soul
  would die two or three hours at a time. At night my breath was out,
  and I died. All at once I saw a shining light—great light—trying my
  soul. I looked and saw my body had no soul—looked at my own body—it
  was dead.”

  “I came through the first time and told my friends, ‘When I die,
  don’t cry,’ and then I died again. Before this I shook hands and
  told my friends I was going to die. Angels told me to look back and
  see my body. I did, and saw it lying down. When I saw it, it was
  pretty poor. My soul left body and went up to judgment place of
  God. I do not know about body after 4 oclock.”

  “I have seen a great light in my soul from that good land; I have
  understand all Christ wants us to do. Before I came alive I saw I
  was sinner. Angel in heaven said to me, ‘You must go back and turn
  alive again on earth.’ I learned that I must be good Christian
  man on earth, or will be punished. My soul was told that I must
  come back and live four days on earth. When I came back, I told
  my friends, ‘There is a God—there is a Christian people. My good
  friends, be Christian.’”

  “When I came alive, I tell my friends, ‘Good thing in heaven. God
  is kind to us. If you all try hard and help me we will be better
  men on earth.’ And now we all feel that it is so.”

  “A good Christian man prayed with me four days. After four days,
  a voice said to me, ‘You shall live on earth four weeks.’ My soul
  was told that they must build a church for me in four weeks. I had
  lumber for a house, and my friends built church. Had it all done in
  four weeks but 6 feet of roof, and spread a mat over that. Soon as
  the church was finished the people came and filled the house and
  began to worship God. I felt strong—bigger than today—all these
  men know this. My friends worked hard, and I am here because they
  finished the house in four weeks. My soul was told to remain on
  earth four weeks more. All my friends came, and every Saturday we
  worshiped God. In four weeks more my soul was told that I should
  live on earth four years if I did right and preached for God. All
  felt thankful, and people joined the church—about fifty people. I
  was promised more time if we worshiped God.”

  “A bad man can’t reach heaven. I believe in God. I saw how bad I
  used to be. God sends us light to see. They know in heaven what we
  think. When people are sick, we pray to God to cure us. We pray
  that he take the evil away and leave the good. If man don’t be
  Christian, he will suffer and see what is bad. When we remember
  Jesus Christ’s name, we always felt happy in our hearts. This is
  good road for us to travel if we hold on. If we do, God’s angels
  are near to our souls. Power from this to help us. When we pray, it
  helps us lots in our hearts. We don’t do good sometimes, because
  our hearts are not right. When our body and heart feel warm, we do
  good and sing good songs. As Christ said, he sends power to every
  believing soul on earth.”

  “While one man can try to start religion here on earth, it don’t
  do much good; they won’t believe him much. That’s why we join to
  worship. Now we are preparing ourselves for judgment. For it is
  said, it don’t make any difference if he prays good and does good.
  God gives him help and words to speak. Makes no difference if
  ‘Boston’ or Indian, if God helps we know it. These things are what
  we learned. We learn good while we pray—voice says, Do good.”

  “It is ten years, now, since we began, and we have good things. We
  all love these things and will follow them all time. We learn to
  help ourselves when sick. When our friend is sick, we kneel and ask
  for help to cure him. We learn something once in a while to cure
  him. Then we do as we know to help him and cure him. If we don’t
  learn to help him, we generally lose him.”

“This is a pretty accurate synopsis of the speech delivered to me
by Slocum, and translated by another Indian, who spoke pretty good
English. But that a more thorough knowledge may be given of their
religious belief, I give also a brief synopsis of another speech made
at the same meeting by Louis Yowaluch, a full-blood Indian, who is the
legal head of this church. It is about as follows:”

  “Well, my friend, we was about the poorest tribe on earth. We was
  only tribe now full blood and nothing else. We would not believe
  anything. Minister came here, but we laugh at him. We loved bad
  habits—stealing—and John Slocum died. He was not a religious
  man—knew nothing of God—all of us same. We heard there was a God
  from Slocum—we could see it. Same time we heard God, we believe
  it. I was worst of lot. I was drunkard—was half starving—spent
  every cent for whisky. I gambled, raced horses, bet shirt, money,
  blankets—did not know any better.”

  “John Slocum brought good to us; his words civilized us. We could
  see. We all felt blind those times. We lost by drowning—our friends
  drink whisky and the canoes turn over—we died out in the bay. Today
  who stopped us from these things?”

  “John Slocum came alive, and I remember God and felt frightened. We
  never heard such a thing as a man dying and bring word that there
  was a God. I became sick for three weeks, four weeks. I hear a
  voice saying to soul, ‘Tomorrow they will be coming to fix you up.’
  Had just heard about John Slocum, and knew it was punishment for my
  bad habits. My heart was black—it was a bad thing.”

  “Now I have quit swearing—my heart is upside down—it is changed.
  After I heard the voice I heard another say: ‘There it is now—some
  one to fix you up. Have you prepared your heart? If you don’t
  believe in Christ, you will go into a big fire and burn forever.’
  I saw a man’s hand coming to my heart. That day I got up—was
  well—talked to my friends, advising them. I will remain a follower
  of Christ as long as I live.”

  “Long ago we knew nothing at all. When Slocum came back from God,
  we found out there was a God. From that time we have prayed for
  anything we want. We follow God’s way. God teaches us if we do bad
  we will go to hell. That’s why we pray and avoid bad habits. If
  we don’t ask grace, bad things come when we eating. When we drink
  water, we think about God before drinking. If we don’t think of
  him, may be we get sick from water. If traveling, may be we die if
  we don’t think of God. We are afraid to do wrong against God. Long
  time ago we worked on Sundays, but no more now. Our brother Christ
  has given us six days to work. On Sunday pray to God. God put
  people here to grow—puts our soul in our body. That’s why we pray
  so much. If we quit, like a man quit his job, he gets no pay. We
  would go to fire in hell. We have no power to put out hell fire.”

“Louis Yowaluch is the strong man of the Shaker church. He is 6 feet
tall, rawboned, muscular, and rather slow. While he may once have been,
as he says, a drunkard, he is now a Christian man. His conservativeness
makes him a fine leader for the organization, while all the Indians
respect him for his humanity and charity, for his honesty and
uprightness, for his fearlessness and love of right. He fully and
freely places John Slocum at the head of the church, as the man who
ascended to heaven and brought back a personal knowledge of the road,
but at the same time he takes the lead in laying out work, building
churches, and sending out preachers to new tribes.”

“A new feature of this religion is found in Sam Yowaluch, the brother
of Louis. He is younger than Louis, and has more of the native
superstition in his character. He has by common consent been placed at
the head of the faith-cure branch of the church. The following synopsis
of his ‘talk’ will be an explanation of his position:”

  “Among the Shakers, John Slocum is first. Louis is next. I take
  power and cure people when they are sick. Long time ago I knew
  nothing—just like an animal. No doctoring, no medicine—no good.
  I was a drunkard, was a thief, and a robber. When I joined this
  religion, I was told to be good. When John Slocum was preaching, I
  heard that if I prayed I would have power and be a medicine-man,
  and could cure the sick. From time John Slocum preached I tried to
  be a good Christian man. I prayed and was sick—my soul was sick. I
  prayed to God and he pays me for that. There is lots of difference
  between this power and old Indian doctoring. This is not old power.
  I can cure people now. I have cured some white men and women, but
  they are ashamed to tell it. I cure without money. One big, rich
  man, Henry Walker, was sick—had great pains in his ear and leg.
  Doctor at Olympia failed to cure him, and he came to John Slocum
  and me. We worked for him, prayed, and he lay down and slept and
  was cured. He offered us twenty dollars—but no, we refused it. God
  will pay us when we die. This is our religion. When we die, we get
  our pay from God.”

  “No, we do not believe the Bible. We believe in God, and in Jesus
  Christ as the Son of God, and we believe in a hell. In these
  matters we believe the same as the Presbyterians. We think fully
  of God today. A good Christian man is a good medicine-man. A good
  Christian man in the dark sees a light toward God. God makes a
  fog—good Christian man goes straight through it to the end, like
  good medicine. I believe this religion. It helps poor people. Bad
  man can’t see good—bad man can’t get to heaven—can’t find his way.
  We were sent to jail for this religion, but we will never give
  up. We all believe that John Slocum died and went to heaven, and
  was sent back to preach to the people. We all talk about that and
  believe it.”

“The Shakers use candles, bells, crucifixes, Catholic pictures, etc.,
in their church and other ceremonies. As Mr Ellis says, they use
paraphernalia of the Catholic, Presbyterian, and even some of the
Indian religion. They cross themselves as the Catholics do; they say
grace before and after meals; they stand and pray and chant in unison;
they set candles around the dead as the Catholics do, and believe in
the cure of the sick by faith and prayer. In times of excitement many
of them twitch and shake, but in no instance do they conduct themselves
in so nervous a manner as I have seen orthodox Christians do at old
Sandy Branch camp-meeting in Illinois. They believe that by praying
with a man or woman and rubbing the person they could induce them to
join their church, and could rub away their sins; but they have no
rite, no ceremony, no belief, no policy, no form of religion that is
not in use by some one or other of our orthodox people.”

“Their religion, in brief, is a belief in God as the father and ruler
of all, and in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Savior of
mankind. They know there is a heaven, for John Slocum was there, and
believe in a hell of fire for the punishment of sinners, because the
angels in heaven told John Slocum about it. They do not care for the
Bible. It is of no use to them, for they have a distinct revelation
direct from heaven. This is the only practical difference between them
and the orthodox believers, and this they do not care for.”

Two of their songs, as recorded by Mr Wickersham, are as follows:


              _Stalib gwuch Kwē Shuck, or Song of Heaven_

    Alkwē klū sutlh akwē schelch huchum akwē shuck;
          When we get warning from heaven;
    Gwalch clah tlōwch kwē lehass;
          Then the angels will come;
    Gwalch clah gwä tä äddō kwē kä-kä tēdtēd;
          Then the wonderful bells will ring;
    Gwalch clah ass kwā-buch kwē kä-kä tsille;
          Then our souls will be ready;
    Gwalch clah ōwhuh tu shuck;
          Then they will go up to heaven;
    Gwalch clah tālib tōbuch ah shō-shō-quille;
          Then we will sing with Jesus;
    Gwalch clah jōil tōbuch ah shō-shō-quille.
          Then we will be happy with Jesus.

               _Quā-dā-tsits Stālib, or Preacher’s Song_

    Chelch lä tā lā, beuch;
      Then we shall sing;
    Chelch lä tā lā beuch;
      Then we shall sing;
    Chelch lä tā lā beuch;
      Then we shall sing;
    Al kwe shuck älläl.
      Up in heaven’s house.

    Chelch lā jōilla;
      Then we’ll be happy;
    Chelch lā jōilla;
      Then we’ll be happy;
    Chelch lā jōilla,
      Then we’ll be happy,
    Al kwe shuck älläl.
      Up in heaven’s house.

    Chelch lā jōilla;
      Then we’ll be happy;
    Chelch lā jōilla;
      Then we’ll be happy;
    Chelch lā jōilla,
      Then we’ll be happy,
    Yuchquē shō-shō-quille.
      Up with Jesus.

Mr Wickersham then gives an account of the persecutions to which
the rising sect was for a long time subjected, chiefly at the hands
of agent Edwin Eells and his brother, Reverend Myron Eells, already
quoted at length, who was at that time the missionary on the Skokomish
reservation. As Mr Wickersham’s statements in this regard are mainly
in the form of extended quotations from Ten Years’ Missionary Work
at Skokomish, written by the Reverend Mr Eells himself, they may
be regarded as conclusive. It is apparent that a part at least of
this persecution, which took the shape of banishment, chains, and
imprisonment, and even the forcible seizure of a dead body from
the bereaved relatives, was due to the fact that the Shakers, who
considered themselves a genuine branch of the Christian church,
were disposed to lean toward Catholicity rather than toward the
denominational form upheld by the agent and his brother.

However, religious persecution failed as utterly in its purpose in this
case as it has and must in all others. Quoting from Mr Eells, “The
chiefs did not care if they were deposed, were about to resign, and did
not wish to have anything more to do with the ‘Boston’ religion or the
agent. Billy Clams was ready, if need be, to suffer as Christ did. He
was willing to be a martyr.”

Mr Wickersham continues:

  “While Billy Clams and some of his people publicly abandoned the
  forms of Shaker religion rather than be banished, yet John Slocum
  and his people refused to so surrender, and the agent sent out
  his police and arrested John Slocum, Louis Yowaluch, and two or
  three more of these people—good, true men—and, loading their limbs
  with chains, confined them for several weeks in the dirty little
  single room of a jail at the Puyallup agency, near Tacoma. Their
  only offense was worship of a different form from that adopted
  by the agent and his brother. They had broken no law, created no
  disorder, and yet they suffered ignominious incarceration in a vile
  dungeon, loaded with chains, at the pleasure of the agent. The
  Shakers believed in God, in Jesus Christ, in heaven and hell, in
  temperance, sobriety, and a virtuous life. They abandoned the old
  Indian religion and all its vices and forms, including the power of
  the doctors or medicine-men. These medicine-men had a great hold
  on the Indian mind, and they joined the minister and the agent in
  their fight on the Shakers, because the Shakers fought them; so
  that there was seen the unique spectacle of the savage shamanism
  of the American Indian and the supposed orthodox religion of
  civilization hand in hand fighting the followers of Jesus Christ.”

  “Imprisonment, banishment, threats, chains, and the general ill
  will of the agent and all his employees were visited on these
  Shakers who continued to practice their forms of worship, and yet
  they did continue it. In spite of the fact that they occupied a
  place only half-way between slaves and freemen, and were under the
  orders of the agent and subject to be harassed and annoyed all the
  time by him, yet they continued nobly and fearlessly to practice
  their religion and to worship God and Jesus Christ as they saw
  fit. To do it, however, they were forced to stay away from the
  reservations, where the greater number of employees were located,
  and their churches were built on Mud bay and Oyster bay, far away
  from the reservations.”

  “But a brighter day came for these people, a day when they could
  stand up and defy every form or force of persecution. In 1886
  Congress passed the Indian land severalty bill, an act providing
  for dividing lands in severalty to Indians, and providing that
  those who took lands and adopted the habits of civilized life
  should be American citizens, with all the rights, privileges, and
  immunities of any other citizen. In 1892 I was appointed by Judge
  Hanford to defend a prisoner in the United States district court at
  Tacoma. The prisoner was accused of selling liquor to a Puyallup
  Indian, but it appeared on cross-examination that this Indian owned
  land in severalty, voted, paid taxes, and exercised other rights
  of citizenship. The question was then raised by me on motion to
  dismiss, that these land-holding, tax-paying Indians were citizens
  of the United States, free and independent. The United States
  prosecuting attorney appeared to contest the claim, but after an
  extended argument Judge Hanford held with me, and the prisoner was
  discharged.”

  “The effect of this decision was far-reaching. It meant that all
  land-holding Indians were no longer wards of the government, but
  free citizens and not under the control of the Indian agent. The
  Shaker people, hearing this, sent a deputation to see me, and I
  held a long consultation with them, assuring them that they were
  as free as the agent, and could establish their own church, own
  and build houses of worship, and do both in religious and worldly
  matters as other citizens of the United States could. This was
  glorious news to them. It meant freedom, it meant the cessation of
  persecution and annoyance by the agency employees, and they were
  jubilant.”

  “Accordingly they met on June 6, 1892, at Mud bay, at Louis
  Yowaluch’s house, and organized their church on a regular business
  basis. The following officers were elected: Headman, Louis
  Yowaluch; elders, John Slocum, Louis Yowaluch, John Smith, James
  Walker, Charles Walker, John W. Simmons, and William James. At
  this meeting the following persons were also appointed ministers
  of this church, and licenses were issued to them, to wit: Louis
  Yowaluch, John Slocum, James Tobin, John Powers, and Richard
  Jackson. Provision was made to establish a church at the Puyallup
  reservation, where the power of the agent had hitherto kept them
  out, and William James, a Puyallup landowner, gave land for a
  church. After much talk about sending out ministers, etc., the
  meeting adjourned, after a two days’ session, and the Shaker
  church, after eleven years’ fighting against persecutions, was an
  established fact, free and independent, with its own officers,
  ministers, and church property.”

[Illustration: +Fig. 68+—Shaker church at Mud bay.]

  “The spectacle of an Indian church with Indian officers, preachers,
  and members, and of houses built by the Indians for church
  purposes, was too much for the average citizen of Puget sound, and
  the Shakers were continually disturbed, not only by the whites,
  but by the Indians who could not and did not appreciate the change
  to citizenship, so that I was constantly applied to for protection
  by the ministers and members of the Shaker church. A ‘paper’ has
  a great effect on the average Indian, and I issued on application
  several papers addressed in general terms to those who might be
  disposed to interfere with them, which had a quieting effect and
  caused evil-disposed persons to respect the Indians and their
  religion, or at least to let them alone. They now feel quite
  confident of their position, and are acting quite like the average
  citizen. Even the persons who persecuted them for eleven years now
  felt obliged to retire from the conflict, and a day of peace is
  reached at last.”

  “The Shaker church now reaches over nearly the whole of western
  Washington. The story of Slocum’s death and visit to heaven, and
  his return to preach to the Indians, is accepted by them as a
  direct revelation of the will of God. They say that they do not
  need to read the Bible, for do they not have better and more
  recent testimony of the existence of heaven and of the way to that
  celestial home than is contained in the Bible? Here is John Slocum,
  alive, and has he not been to heaven? Then, why read the Bible to
  learn the road, when John can so easily tell them all about it?
  The Bible says there are many roads; the Catholics have one, the
  Presbyterians another, and the Congregationalists a third; but John
  Slocum gives them a short, straight road—and they choose that.”

  “The Shaker church now has a building for church purposes at Mud
  bay, at Oyster bay, at Cowlitz, Chehalis, and Puyallup. They have
  about a dozen ministers regularly licensed, and about 500 members.
  Most of the Indians at Skokomish belong, while the Squaxins,
  Chehalis, Nisqually, Cowlitz, and Columbia River Indians, and in
  fact the majority of the Indians of western Washington, either
  belong or are in sympathy with its teachings, so that it is now the
  strongest church among them. They are sending out runners to the
  Yakimas east of the Cascade mountains, and expect before long to
  make an effort to convert that tribe.”

  “The Indian is inclined to be weak, and to adopt the vices of the
  white man, but not his virtues. However, this is not true of the
  Shakers. They do not drink intoxicants of any kind, and make a
  special effort at all times to banish liquor. This is the strong
  element in their faith, and the one for which they fight hardest.
  They feel upon their honor in the matter, and contrast the members
  of their church at every place with those belonging to the other
  denominations—and it is too true that an Indian does not seem at
  all to be restrained from drink by belonging to the other churches
  as he does in the Shaker church. In the others he feels no personal
  interest. The honor of neither himself nor his people is involved,
  and if he disgraces himself it reflects, in his opinion, rather
  on the white man’s church. Not so with the Shakers. No white man
  belongs to their church, and it is their boast that no white
  preacher can keep his Indian members from drink as they can—and it
  is true. After their opposition to liquor, next comes gambling.
  From these two vices flow nearly all troubles to the Indian, and
  the Shakers are certainly successful in extinguishing their spread
  among the Indians. They make special war on drunkenness, gambling,
  and horse racing, and preach honesty, sobriety, temperance, and
  right living.”

  “The Presbyterian church occupies a queer position, with regard to
  these people. The Reverend M. G. Mann has been the missionary to
  the Indians of Puget sound for many years, and has succeeded in
  making a very favorable impression upon them. He has been specially
  attentive to the Shakers, and, to his credit be it said, has never
  tried to coerce them, and has only dealt with them kindly. So far
  has this gone that Louis Yowaluch was long ago taken into the
  Presbyterian church, and is now an accredited elder therein. Louis
  does not know, seemingly, how to escape from his dual position,
  or rather does not seem to think that he needs to escape. It all
  seems to be for the best interest of his people, so he continues to
  occupy the position of elder in the Presbyterian church and headman
  of the Shaker church.”

  “At a recent meeting of the Presbyterian ministers the position of
  these Shaker people was fully discussed, and the strongest language
  was used in saying only good about them, and every effort seems
  to be made by the Presbyterians to claim the Shakers in a body
  as members of the Presbyterian church. If this account were not
  already too long, the reports of the church on the subject would
  be quoted, but the fact speaks volumes for the character of the
  Shakers and their teaching.”

  “In conclusion: I have known the Shaker people now intimately, as
  their attorney, for more than a year, and out of the many drunken
  Indians I have seen in that time not one was a Shaker. Not one
  of their people has been arrested for crime in that time. They
  are good citizens, and are far more temperate and peaceable than
  those Indians belonging to the other churches. I feel that their
  church is a grand success in that it prevents idleness and vice,
  drunkenness and disorder, and tends to produce quiet, peaceable
  citizens, and good Christian people. I think the Presbyterians
  make a mistake in trying to bring the Shakers into their fold—they
  ought rather to protect them and give them every assistance in
  their autonomy. It adds the greatest incentive to their labors, and
  makes them feel as if they were of some account. It lets them labor
  for themselves, instead of feeling, as always heretofore, that
  some one else—they hardly knew who—was responsible. Their forms of
  Christianity are not very unorthodox—their Christianity is quite
  orthodox, not exactly because they take Slocum’s revelation instead
  of the Bible, but the result is the same—a Christian.”

                                                “+James Wickersham.+”
  “+Tacoma, Washington+, _June 25, 1893_.”

From competent Indian informants of eastern Washington—Charles Ike,
half-blood Yakima interpreter, and Chief Wolf Necklace of the Pä’lus,
we gather additional particulars, from which it would appear that
there are more things in the Shaker system than are dreamed of in the
philosophy of the Presbyterian general assembly.

According to their statements, Yowaluch, or Ai-yäl, as he is known
east of the Cascades, was noted as a gambler before he received his
revelation. His followers are called _Shäpupu-‛lĕma_, or “blowers,”
by the Yakima, from the fact that on meeting a stranger, instead of
at once shaking hands with him in the usual manner, they first wave
the hand gently in front of his face like a fan, and blow on him, in
order to “blow away the badness” from him. They first appeared among
the Yakima and other eastern tribes about six years ago, and are
gradually gaining adherents, although as yet they have no regular time
or place of assembly. They are much addicted to making the sign of the
cross—the cross, it is hardly necessary to state, being as much an
Indian as a Christian symbol—and are held in great repute as doctors,
their treatment consisting chiefly of hypnotic performances over the
patient, resulting in the spasmodic shaking already described. In
doctoring a patient the “blowers” usually gather around him in a circle
to the number of about twelve, dressed in a very attractive ceremonial
costume, and each wearing on his head a sort of crown of woven cedar
bark, in which are fixed two lighted candles, while in his right hand
he carries a small cloth, and in the left another lighted candle. By
fastening screens of colored cloth over the candles the light is made
to appear yellow, white, or blue. The candle upon the forehead is
yellow, symbolic of the celestial glory; that at the back of the head
is white, typical of the terrestrial light, while the third is blue,
the color of the sky.

Frequently also they carry in their hands or wear on their heads
garlands of roses and other flowers of various colors, yellow, white,
and blue being the favorite, which they say represent the colors of
objects in the celestial world. While the leader is going through his
hypnotic performance over the patient the others are waving the cloths
and swinging in circles the candles held in their hands. In all this it
is easy to see the influence of the Catholic ritual, with its censers,
tapers, and flowers, with which these tribes have been more or less
familiar for the last fifty years.

A single instance will suffice to show the methods of the blower
doctors. The story is told from the Indian point of view, as related
by the half-blood interpreter, who believed it all. About six years
ago two of these doctors from the north, while visiting near Woodland
on the Columbia, were called to the assistance of a woman who was
seriously ill, and had received no benefit from the treatment of
the native doctors. They came and almost immediately on seeing the
patient announced to the relatives that the sickness had been put into
her by the evil magic of a neighboring medicine-man, whom they then
summoned into their presence. When the messenger arrived for him, the
medicine-man refused to go, saying that the doctors were liars and
that he had not made the woman ill. By their clairaudient power—or
possibly by a shrewd anticipation of probabilities—the doctors in the
other house knew of his refusal and sent another messenger to tell
him that concealment or denial would not avail him, and that if he
refused to come they would proceed to blow the sickness into his own
body. Without further argument he accompanied the messengers to the
sick woman’s house. As he entered, the chief doctor stepped up to
him and looking intently into his face, said, “I can see your heart
within your body, and it is black with evil things. You are not fit
to live. You are making this woman sick, but we shall take out the
badness from her body.” With the cloths and lighted candles the two
doctors then approached the sick woman, and commanded her to arise,
which she did, although she had been supposed to be too weak to stand.
Waving the cloths in front of her with a gentle fanning motion, and
blowing upon her at the same time, they proceeded to drive the disease
out of her body, beginning at the feet and working upward until, as
they approached the head the principal doctor changed the movement to
a rapid fanning and corresponding blowing, while the assistant stood
ready with his cloth to seize the disease when it should be driven out.
All this time the medicine-man standing a few feet away was shaking and
quivering like one in a fit, and the trembling became more violent and
spasmodic as the doctors increased the speed of their motions. Finally
the leader brought his hands together over the woman’s head, where,
just as the disease attempted to escape, it was seized and imprisoned
in the cloth held by his assistant. Then, going up to the medicine-man,
with a few rapid passes they fanned the disease into his body and he
fell down dead. The woman recovered, and with her sister has recently
come up to the Yakima country as an apostle of the new religion,
preaching the doctrines and performing the wonders which she has been
taught by the Nisqually doctors.

This is the Indian story as told by the half-blood, who did not claim
to have been an eye-witness, but spoke of it as a matter of common
knowledge and beyond question. It is doubtless substantially correct.
The hypnotic action described is the same which the author has
repeatedly seen employed in the Ghost dance, resulting successively in
involuntary trembling, violent spasmodic action, rigidity, and final
deathlike unconsciousness. The Ghost dancers regard the process not
only as a means of bringing them into trance communication with their
departed friends, but also as a preventive and cure of disease, just
as we have our faith healers and magnetic doctors. With the Indian’s
implicit faith in the supernatural ability of the doctor, it is easy
to suppose that the mental effect on the woman, who was told and
believed that she was to be cured, would aid recovery if recovery was
possible. It is unlikely that death resulted to the medicine-man. It
is more probable that under the hypnotic spell of the doctors he fell
unconscious and apparently lifeless and remained so perhaps for a
considerable time, as frequently happens with sensitive subjects in
the Ghost dance. The fact that the same process should produce exactly
opposite effects in the two subjects is easily explainable. The object
of the hypnotic performance was simply to bring the mind of the subject
under the control of the operator. This accomplished, the mental, and
ultimately the physical, effect on either subject was whatever the
operator wished it to be. After bringing both under mental control in
the manner described, he suggested recovery to the woman and sickness
or death to the medicine-man, and the result followed.

Until the advent of these women from beyond the mountains such hypnotic
performances seem to have been unknown among the Yakima and other
eastern tribes of the Columbia region, the trance condition in the
Smohalla devotees being apparently due entirely to the effect of the
rhythmic dances and songs acting on excited imaginations, without the
aid of blowing or manual passes.

Hypnotism and so-called magnetism, however, appear to have been
employed by the medicine-men of the Chinook tribes of the lower
Columbia from ancient times. Especially wonderful in this connection
are the stories told of one of these men residing at Wushqûm or Wisham,
near The Dalles.

About the time the two blower doctors appeared at Woodland, other
apostles of the same doctrine, or it may have been the same two
men, went up Willamet river into central Oregon, teaching the same
system and performing the same wonders among the tribes of that
region. And here comes in a remarkable coincidence, if it be no more.
It is said among the northern Indians that on this journey these
apostles met, somewhere in the south, a young man to whom they taught
their mysteries, in which he became such an apt pupil that he soon
outstripped his teachers, and is now working even greater wonders
among his own people. This young man can be no other than Wovoka,
the messiah of the Ghost dance, living among the Paiute in western
Nevada. The only question is whether the story told among the Columbia
tribes is a myth based on vague rumors of the southern messiah and
his hypnotic performances, so similar to that of the blower doctors,
or whether Wovoka actually derived his knowledge of such things from
these northern apostles. The latter supposition is entirely within
the bounds of possibility. The time corresponds with the date of his
original revelations, as stated by himself to the writer. He is a young
man, and, although he has never been far from home, the tribe to which
he belongs roams in scattered bands over the whole country to the
Willamet and the watershed of the Columbia, so that communication with
the north is by no means difficult. He himself stated that Indians from
Warmspring reservation, in northern Oregon, have attended his dances
near Walker lake.




                             +Chapter IX+

                          WOVOKA THE MESSIAH

  When the sun died, I went up to heaven and saw God and all the
  people who had died a long time ago. God told me to come back
  and tell my people they must be good and love one another, and
  not fight, or steal, or lie. He gave me this dance to give to my
  people.—_Wovoka._


When Tävibo, the prophet of Mason valley, died, about 1870, he left a
son named Wovoka, “The Cutter,” about 14 years of age. The prophetic
claims and teachings of the father, the reverence with which he was
regarded by the people, and the mysterious ceremonies which were
doubtless of frequent performance in the little tulé wikiup at home
must have made early and deep impression on the mind of the boy,
who seems to have been by nature of a solitary and contemplative
disposition, one of those born to see visions and hear still voices.

[Illustration: +Fig. 69+—Wovoka.]

The physical environment was favorable to the development of such a
character. His native valley, from which he has never wandered, is
a narrow strip of level sage prairie some 30 miles in length, walled
in by the giant sierras, their sides torn and gashed by volcanic
convulsions and dark with gloomy forests of pine, their towering
summits white with everlasting snows, and roofed over by a cloudless
sky whose blue infinitude the mind instinctively seeks to penetrate to
far-off worlds beyond. Away to the south the view is closed in by the
sacred mountain of the Paiute, where their Father gave them the first
fire and taught them their few simple arts before leaving for his home
in the upper regions of the Sun-land. Like the valley of Rasselas, it
seems set apart from the great world to be the home of a dreamer.

The greater portion of Nevada is an arid desert of rugged mountains
and alkali plains, the little available land being confined to narrow
mountain valleys and the borders of a few large lakes. These tracts
are occupied by scattered ranchmen engaged in stock raising, and as
the white population is sparse, Indian labor is largely utilized, the
Paiute being very good workers. The causes which in other parts of
the country have conspired to sweep the Indian from the path of the
white man seem inoperative here, where the aboriginal proprietors are
regarded rather as peons under the protection of the dominant race, and
are allowed to set up their small camps of tulé lodges in convenient
out-of-the-way places, where they spend the autumn and winter in
hunting, fishing, and gathering seeds and piñon nuts, working at fair
wages on ranches through spring and summer. In this way young Wovoka
became attached to the family of a ranchman in Mason valley, named
David Wilson, who took an interest in him and bestowed on him the name
of Jack Wilson, by which he is commonly known among the whites. From
his association with this family he gained some knowledge of English,
together with a confused idea of the white man’s theology. On growing
up he married, and still continued to work for Mr Wilson, earning a
reputation for industry and reliability, but attracting no special
notice until nearly 30 years of age, when he announced the revelation
that has made him famous among the tribes of the west.

Following are the various forms of his name which I have noticed:
Wo′voka, or Wü′voka, which I have provisionally rendered “Cutter,”
derived from a verb signifying “to cut;” Wevokar, Wopokahte,
Kwohitsauq, Cowejo, Koit-tsow, Kvit-Tsow, Quoitze Ow, Jack Wilson,
Jackson Wilson, Jack Winson, John Johnson. He has also been confounded
with Bannock Jim, a Mormon Bannock of Fort Hall reservation, Idaho, and
with Johnson Sides, a Paiute living near Reno, Nevada, and bitterly
opposed to Wovoka. His father’s name, Tävibo, has been given also as
Waughzeewaughber. It is not quite certain that the Paiute prophet of
1870 was the father of Wovoka. This is stated to have been the case
by one of Captain Lee’s informants (_A. G. O., 4_) and by Lieutenant
Phister (_Phister, 2_). Wovoka himself says that his father did not
preach, but was a “dreamer” with supernatural powers. Certain it is
that a similar doctrine was taught by an Indian living in the same
valley in Wovoka’s boyhood. Possibly the discrepancy might be explained
by an unwillingness on the part of the messiah to share his spiritual
honors.

In proportion as Wovoka and his doctrines have become subjects of
widespread curiosity, so have they become subjects of ignorant
misrepresentation and deliberate falsification. Different writers have
made him a Paiute, a half-blood, and a Mormon white man. Numberless
stories have been told of the origin and character of his mission and
the day predicted for its final accomplishment. The most mischievous
and persistent of these stories has been that which represents him as
preaching a bloody campaign against the whites, whereas his doctrine is
one of peace, and he himself is a mild-tempered member of a weak and
unwarlike tribe. His own good name has been filched from him and he
has been made to appear under a dozen different cognomens, including
that of his bitterest enemy, Johnson Sides. He has been denounced as an
impostor, ridiculed as a lunatic, and laughed at as a pretended Christ,
while by the Indians he is revered as a direct messenger from the
Other World, and among many of the remote tribes he is believed to be
omniscient, to speak all languages, and to be invisible to a white man.
We shall give his own story as told by himself, with such additional
information as seems to come from authentic sources.

Notwithstanding all that had been said and written by newspaper
correspondents about the messiah, not one of them had undertaken to
find the man himself and to learn from his own lips what he really
taught. It is almost equally certain that none of them had even seen
a Ghost dance at close quarters—certainly none of them understood
its meaning. The messiah was regarded almost as a myth, something
intangible, to be talked about but not to be seen. The first reliable
information as to his personality was communicated by the scout, Arthur
Chapman, who, under instructions from the War Department, visited
the Paiute country in December, 1890, and spent four days at Walker
lake and Mason valley, and in the course of an interview with Wovoka
obtained from him a detailed statement similar in all essentials to
that which I obtained later on. (_Sec. War, 3._)

After having spent seven months in the field, investigating the new
religion among the prairie tribes, particularly the Arapaho, and after
having examined all the documents bearing on the subject in the files
of the Indian Office and War Department, the author left Washington
in November, 1891, to find and talk with the messiah and to gather
additional material concerning the Ghost dance. Before starting, I
had written to the agent in charge of the reservation to which he
was attached for information in regard to the messiah (Jack Wilson)
and the dance, and learned in reply, with some surprise, that the
agent had never seen him. The surprise grew into wonder when I was
further informed that there were “neither Ghost songs, dances, nor
ceremonials” among the Paiute.[6] This was discouraging, but not
entirely convincing, and I set out once more for the west. After a few
days with the Omaha and Winnebago in Nebraska, and a longer stay with
the Sioux at Pine Ridge, where traces of the recent conflict were still
fresh on every hand, I crossed over the mountains and finally arrived
at Walker Lake reservation in Nevada.

On inquiry I learned that the messiah lived, not on the reservation,
but in Mason valley, about 40 miles to the northwest. His uncle,
Charley Sheep, lived near the agency, however, so I sought him
out and made his acquaintance. He spoke tolerable—or rather
intolerable—English, so that we were able to get along together
without an interpreter, a fact which brought us into closer sympathy,
as an interpreter is generally at best only a necessary evil. As
usual, he was very suspicious at first, and inquired minutely as to
my purpose. I explained to him that I was sent out by the government
to the various tribes to study their customs and learn their stories
and songs; that I had obtained a good deal from other tribes and now
wanted to learn some songs and stories of the Paiute, in order to write
them down so that the white people could read them. In a casual way
I then offered to show him the pictures of some of my Indian friends
across the mountains, and brought out the photos of several Arapaho
and Cheyenne who I knew had recently come as delegates to the messiah.
This convinced him that I was all right, and he became communicative.
The result was that we spent about a week together in the wikiups
(lodges of tulé rushes), surrounded always by a crowd of interested
Paiute, discussing the old stories and games, singing Paiute songs,
and sampling the seed mush and roasted piñon nuts. On one of these
occasions, at night, a medicine-man was performing his incantations
over a sick child on one side of the fire while we were talking on
the other. When the ice was well thawed, I cautiously approached the
subject of the ghost songs and dance, and, as confidence was now
established, I found no difficulty in obtaining a number of the songs,
with a description of the ceremonial. I then told Charley that, as I
had taken part in the dance, I was anxious to see the messiah and get
from him some medicine-paint to bring back to his friends among the
eastern tribes. He readily agreed to go with me and use his efforts
with his nephew to obtain what was wanted.

It is 20 miles northward by railroad from Walker River agency to
Wabuska, and 12 miles more in a southwesterly direction from there
to the Mason valley settlement. There we met a young white man named
Dyer, who was well acquainted with Jack Wilson, and who also spoke the
Paiute language, and learned from him that the messiah was about 12
miles farther up the valley, near a place called Pine Grove. Enlisting
his services, with a team and driver, making four in all, we started
up toward the mountain. It was New Year’s day of 1892, and there was
deep snow on the ground, a very unusual thing in this part of the
country, and due in this instance, as Charley assured us, to the direct
agency of Jack Wilson. It is hard to imagine anything more monotonously
unattractive than a sage prairie under ordinary circumstances unless it
be the same prairie when covered by a heavy fall of snow, under which
the smaller clumps of sagebrush look like prairie-dog mounds, while
the larger ones can hardly be distinguished at a short distance from
wikiups. However, the mountains were bright in front of us, the sky was
blue overhead, and the road was good under foot.

Soon after leaving the settlement we passed the dance ground with the
brush shelters still standing. We met but few Indians on the way. After
several miles we noticed a man at some distance from the road with
a gun across his shoulder. Dyer looked a moment and then exclaimed,
“I believe that’s Jack now!” The Indian thought so, too, and pulling
up our horses he shouted some words in the Paiute language. The man
replied, and sure enough it was the messiah, hunting jack rabbits. At
his uncle’s call he soon came over.

As he approached I saw that he was a young man, a dark full-blood,
compactly built, and taller than the Paiute generally, being nearly
6 feet in height. He was well dressed in white man’s clothes, with
the broad-brimmed white felt hat common in the west, secured on his
head by means of a beaded ribbon under the chin. This, with a blanket
or a robe of rabbit skins, is now the ordinary Paiute dress. He wore
a good pair of boots. His hair was cut off square on a line below
the base of the ears, after the manner of his tribe. His countenance
was open and expressive of firmness and decision, but with no marked
intellectuality. The features were broad and heavy, very different from
the thin, clear-cut features of the prairie tribes.

[Illustration: PL. XCII

  WINTER VIEW IN MASON VALLEY, SHOWING SNOW-COVERED SAGEBRUSH]

As he came up he took my hand with a strong, hearty grasp, and
inquired what was wanted. His uncle explained matters, adding that I
was well acquainted with some of his Indian friends who had visited
him a short time before, and was going back to the same people. After
some deliberation he said that the whites had lied about him and
he did not like to talk to them; some of the Indians had disobeyed
his instructions and trouble had come of it, but as I was sent by
Washington and was a friend of his friends, he would talk with me. He
was hunting now, but if we would come to his camp that night he would
tell us about his mission.

With another hand-shake he left us, and we drove on to the nearest
ranch, arriving about dark. After supper we got ready and started
across country through the sagebrush for the Paiute camp, some miles
away, guided by our Indian. It was already night, with nothing to be
seen but the clumps of snow-covered sagebrush stretching away in every
direction, and after traveling an hour or more without reaching the
camp, our guide had to confess that he had lost the trail. It was two
years since he had been there, his sight was failing, and, with the
snow and the darkness, he was utterly at a loss to know his whereabouts.

To be lost on a sage plain on a freezing night in January is not a
pleasant experience. There was no road, and no house but the one we had
left some miles behind, and it would be almost impossible to find our
way back to that through the darkness. Excepting for a lantern there
was no light but what came from the glare of the snow and a few stars
in the frosty sky overhead. To add to our difficulty, the snow was cut
in every direction by cattle trails, which seemed to be Indian trails,
and kept us doubling and circling to no purpose, while in the uncertain
gloom every large clump of sagebrush took on the appearance of a
wikiup, only to disappoint us on a nearer approach. With it all, the
night was bitterly cold and we were half frozen. After vainly following
a dozen false trails and shouting repeatedly in hope of hearing an
answering cry, we hit on the expedient of leaving the Indian with the
wagon, he being the oldest man of the party, while the rest of us each
took a different direction from the central point, following the cattle
tracks in the snow and calling to each other at short intervals, in
order that we might not become lost from one another. After going
far enough to know that none of us had yet struck the right trail,
the wagon was moved up a short distance and the same performance was
repeated. At last a shout from our driver brought us all together. He
declared that he had heard sounds in front, and after listening a few
minutes in painful suspense we saw a shower of sparks go up into the
darkness and knew that we had struck the camp. Going back to the wagon,
we got in and drove straight across to the spot, where we found three
or four little wikiups, in one of which we were told the messiah was
awaiting our arrival.

On entering through the low doorway we found ourselves in a circular
lodge made of bundles of tulé rushes laid over a framework of poles,
after the fashion of the thatched roofs of Europe, and very similar
to the grass lodges of the Wichita. The lodge was only about 10 feet
in diameter and about 8 feet in height, with sloping sides, and was
almost entirely open above, like a cone with the top cut off, as in
this part of the country rain or snow is of rare occurrence. As already
remarked, the deep snow at the time was something unusual. In the
center, built directly on the ground, was a blazing fire of sagebrush,
upon which fresh stalks were thrown from time to time, sending up a
shower of sparks into the open air. It was by this means that we had
been guided to the camp. Sitting or lying around the fire were half a
dozen Paiute, including the messiah and his family, consisting of his
young wife, a boy about 4 years of age, of whom he seemed very fond,
and an infant. It was plain that he was a kind husband and father,
which was in keeping with his reputation among the whites for industry
and reliability. The only articles in the nature of furniture were a
few grass woven bowls and baskets of various sizes and patterns. There
were no Indian beds or seats of the kind found in every prairie tipi,
no rawhide boxes, no toilet pouches, not even a hole dug in the ground
for the fire. Although all wore white men’s dress, there were no pots,
pans, or other articles of civilized manufacture, now used by even
the most primitive prairie tribes, for, strangely enough, although
these Paiute are practically farm laborers and tenants of the whites
all around them, and earn good wages, they seem to covet nothing of
the white man’s, but spend their money for dress, small trinkets,
and ammunition for hunting, and continue to subsist on seeds, piñon
nuts, and small game, lying down at night on the dusty ground in their
cramped wikiups, destitute of even the most ordinary conveniences in
use among other tribes. It is a curious instance of a people accepting
the inevitable while yet resisting innovation.

Wovoka received us cordially and then inquired more particularly as to
my purpose in seeking an interview. His uncle entered into a detailed
explanation, which stretched out to a preposterous length, owing to a
peculiar conversational method of the Paiute. Each statement by the
older man was repeated at its close, word for word and sentence by
sentence, by the other, with the same monotonous inflection. This
done, the first speaker signified by a grunt of approval that it had
been correctly repeated, and then proceeded with the next statement,
which was duly repeated in like manner. The first time I had heard two
old men conversing together in this fashion on the reservation I had
supposed they were reciting some sort of Indian litany, and it required
several such experiences and some degree of patience to become used to
it.

At last he signified that he understood and was satisfied, and then in
answer to my questions gave an account of himself and his doctrine, a
great part of the interpretation being by Dyer, with whom he seemed
to be on intimate terms. He said he was about 35 years of age, fixing
the date from a noted battle[7] between the Paiute and the whites near
Pyramid lake, in 1860, at which time he said he was about the size
of his little boy; who appeared to be of about 4 years. His father,
Tävibo, “White Man,” was not a preacher, but was a _capita_ (from the
Spanish _capitan_) or petty chief, and was a dreamer and invulnerable.
His own proper name from boyhood was Wovoka or Wüvoka, “The Cutter,”
but a few years ago he had assumed the name of his paternal
grandfather, Kwohitsauq, or “Big Rumbling Belly.” After the death of
his father he had been taken into the family of a white farmer, David
Wilson, who had given him the name of Jack Wilson, by which he is
commonly known among the whites. He thus has three distinct names,
Wovoka, Kwohitsauq, and Jack Wilson. He stated positively that he was
a full-blood, a statement borne out by his appearance. The impression
that he is a half-blood may have arisen from the fact that his father’s
name was “White Man” and that he has a white man’s name. His followers,
both in his own and in all other tribes, commonly refer to him as “our
father.” He has never been away from Mason valley and speaks only his
own Paiute language, with some little knowledge of English. He is not
acquainted with the sign language, which is hardly known west of the
mountains.

When about 20 years of age, he married, and continued to work for Mr
Wilson. He had given the dance to his people about four years before,
but had received his great revelation about two years previously. On
this occasion “the sun died” (was eclipsed) and he fell asleep in the
daytime and was taken up to the other world. Here he saw God, with all
the people who had died long ago engaged in their oldtime sports and
occupations, all happy and forever young. It was a pleasant land and
full of game. After showing him all, God told him he must go back
and tell his people they must be good and love one another, have no
quarreling, and live in peace with the whites; that they must work,
and not lie or steal; that they must put away all the old practices
that savored of war; that if they faithfully obeyed his instructions
they would at last be reunited with their friends in this other world,
where there would be no more death or sickness or old age. He was then
given the dance which he was commanded to bring back to his people.
By performing this dance at intervals, for five consecutive days each
time, they would secure this happiness to themselves and hasten the
event. Finally God gave him control over the elements so that he could
make it rain or snow or be dry at will, and appointed him his deputy
to take charge of affairs in the west, while “Governor Harrison” would
attend to matters in the east, and he, God, would look after the
world above. He then returned to earth and began to preach as he was
directed, convincing the people by exercising the wonderful powers that
had been given him.

In 1890 Josephus, a Paiute informant, thus described to the scout
Chapman the occasion of Wovoka’s first inspiration: “About three years
ago Jack Wilson took his family and went into the mountains to cut
wood for Mr Dave Wilson. One day while at work he heard a great noise
which appeared to be above him on the mountain. He laid down his ax
and started to go in the direction of the noise, when he fell down
dead, and God came and took him to heaven.” Afterward on one or two
other occasions “God came and took him to heaven again.” Wovoka also
told Chapman that he had then been preaching to the Indians about
three years. In our conversation he said nothing about a mysterious
noise, and stated that it was about two years since he had visited
heaven and received his great revelation, but that it was about four
years since he had first taught the dance to his people. The fact that
he has different revelations from time to time would account for the
discrepancy of statement.

He disclaimed all responsibility for the ghost shirt which formed so
important a part of the dance costume among the Sioux; said that there
were no trances in the dance as performed among his people—a statement
confirmed by eye-witnesses among the neighboring ranchmen—and earnestly
repudiated any idea of hostility toward the whites, asserting that his
religion was one of universal peace. When questioned directly, he said
he believed it was better for the Indians to follow the white man’s
road and to adopt the habits of civilization. If appearances are in
evidence he is sincere in this, for he was dressed in a good suit of
white man’s clothing, and works regularly on a ranch, although living
in a wikiup. While he repudiated almost everything for which he had
been held responsible in the east, he asserted positively that he had
been to the spirit world and had been given a revelation and message
from God himself, with full control over the elements. From his uncle
I learned that Wovoka has five songs for making it rain, the first of
which brings on a mist or cloud, the second a snowfall, the third a
shower, and the fourth a hard rain or storm, while when he sings the
fifth song the weather again becomes clear.

I knew that he was holding something in reserve, as no Indian would
unbosom himself on religious matters to a white man with whom he had
not had a long and intimate acquaintance. Especially was this true
in view of the warlike turn affairs had taken across the mountains.
Consequently I accepted his statements with several grains of salt, but
on the whole he seemed to be honest in his belief and his supernatural
claims, although, like others of the priestly function, he occasionally
resorts to cheap trickery to keep up the impression as to his
miraculous powers. From some of the reports he is evidently an expert
sleight-of-hand performer. He makes no claim to be Christ, the Son of
God, as has been so often asserted in print. He does claim to be a
prophet who has received a divine revelation. I could not help feeling
that he was sincere in his repudiation of a number of the wonderful
things attributed to him, for the reason that he insisted so strongly
on other things fully as trying to the faith of a white man. He made
no argument and advanced no proofs, but said simply that he had been
with God, as though the statement no more admitted of controversy than
the proposition that 2 and 2 are 4. From Mr J. O. Gregory, formerly
employed at the agency, and well acquainted with the prophet, I learned
that Wovoka had once requested him to draw up and forward to the
President a statement of his supernatural claims, with a proposition
that if he could receive a small regular stipend he would take up his
residence on the reservation and agree to keep Nevada people informed
of all the latest news from heaven and to furnish rain whenever wanted.
The letter was never forwarded.

From a neighboring ranchman, who knew Wovoka well and sometimes
employed him in the working season, I obtained a statement which seems
to explain the whole matter. It appears that a short time before
the prophet began to preach he was stricken down by a severe fever,
during which illness the ranchman frequently visited and ministered to
him. While he was still sick there occurred an eclipse of the sun, a
phenomenon which always excites great alarm among primitive peoples. In
their system the sun is a living being, of great power and beneficence,
and the temporary darkness is caused by an attack on him by some
supernatural monster which endeavors to devour him, and will succeed,
and thus plunge the world into eternal night unless driven off by
incantations and loud noises. On this occasion the Paiute were frantic
with excitement and the air was filled with the noise of shouts and
wailings and the firing of guns, for the purpose of frightening off the
monster that threatened the life of their god. It was now, as Wovoka
stated, “when the sun died,” that he went to sleep in the daytime and
was taken up to heaven. This means simply that the excitement and alarm
produced by the eclipse, acting on a mind and body already enfeebled
by sickness, resulted in delirium, in which he imagined himself to
enter the portals of the spirit world. Constant dwelling on the subject
in thought by day and in dreams by night would effect and perpetuate
the exalted mental condition in which visions of the imagination would
have all the seeming reality of actual occurrences. To those acquainted
with the spiritual nature of Indians and their implicit faith in dreams
all this is perfectly intelligible. His frequent trances would indicate
also that, like so many other religious ecstatics, he is subject to
cataleptic attacks.

I have not been able to settle satisfactorily the date of this eclipse.
From inquiry at the Nautical Almanac office I learn that solar eclipses
visible in Nevada and the adjacent territory from 1884 to 1890 occurred
as follows: 1884, October 18, partial; 1885, March 16, partial; 1886,
March 5, partial; 1887, none; 1888, none; 1889, January 1, total or
partial; 1890, none. The total eclipse of January 1, 1889, agrees best
with his statement to me on New Year’s night, 1892, that it was about
two years since he had gone up to heaven when the sun died. It must
be noted that Indians generally count years by winters instead of by
series of twelve calendar months, a difference which sometimes makes an
apparent discrepancy of nearly a year.

In subsequent conversations he added a few minor details in regard
to his vision and his doctrine. He asked many questions in regard to
the eastern tribes whose delegates had visited him, and was pleased
to learn that the delegates from several of these tribes were my
friends. He spoke particularly of the large delegation—about twelve in
number—from the Cheyenne and Arapaho, who had visited him the preceding
summer and taken part in the dance with his people. Nearly all the
members of this party were personally known to me, and the leader,
Black Coyote, whose picture I had with me and showed to him, had been
my principal instructor in the Ghost dance among the Arapaho. While
this fact put me on a more confidential footing with Wovoka, it also
proved of great assistance in my further investigation on my return to
the prairie tribes, as, when they were satisfied from my statements
and the specimens which I had brought back that I had indeed seen and
talked with the messiah, they were convinced that I was earnestly
desirous of understanding their religion aright, and from that time
spoke freely and without reserve.

I had my camera and was anxious to get Wovoka’s picture. When the
subject was mentioned, he replied that his picture had never been made;
that a white man had offered him five dollars for permission to take
his photograph, but that he had refused. However, as I had been sent
from Washington especially to learn and tell the whites all about him
and his doctrine, and as he was satisfied from my acquaintance with his
friends in the other tribes that I must be a good man, he would allow
me to take his picture. As usual in dealing with Indians, he wanted
to make the most of his bargain, and demanded two dollars and a half
for the privilege of taking his picture and a like sum for each one
of his family. I was prepared for this, however, and refused to pay
any such charges, but agreed to give him my regular price per day for
his services as informant and to send him a copy of the picture when
finished. After some demur he consented and got ready for the operation
by knotting a handkerchief about his neck, fastening an eagle feather
at his right elbow, and taking a wide brim sombrero upon his knee. I
afterward learned that the feather and sombrero were important parts
of his spiritual stock in trade. After taking his picture I obtained
from him, as souvenirs to bring back and show to my Indian friends in
Indian Territory, a blanket of rabbit skins, some piñon nuts, some tail
feathers of the magpie, highly prized by the Paiute for ornamentation,
and some of the sacred red paint, endowed with most miraculous powers,
which plays so important a part in the ritual of the Ghost-dance
religion. Then, with mutual expressions of good will, we parted, his
uncle going back to the reservation, while I took the train for Indian
Territory.

As soon as the news of my arrival went abroad among the Cheyenne and
Arapaho on my return, my friends of both tribes came in, eager to
hear all the details of my visit to the messiah and to get my own
impressions of the man. In comparing notes with some of the recent
delegates I discovered something of Wovoka’s hypnotic methods, and
incidentally learned how much of miracle depends on the mental
receptivity of the observer.

The Cheyenne and Arapaho, although for generations associated in the
most intimate manner, are of very different characters. In religious
matters it may be said briefly that the Arapaho are devotees and
prophets, continually seeing signs and wonders, while the Cheyenne
are more skeptical. In talking with Tall Bull, one of the Cheyenne
delegates and then captain of the Indian police, he said that
before leaving they had asked Wovoka to give them some proof of his
supernatural powers. Accordingly he had ranged them in front of him,
seated on the ground, he sitting facing them, with his sombrero between
and his eagle feathers in his hand. Then with a quick movement he
had put his hand into the empty hat and drawn out from it “something
black.” Tall Bull would not admit that anything more had happened,
and did not seem to be very profoundly impressed by the occurrence,
saying that he thought there were medicine-men of equal capacity among
the Cheyenne. In talking soon afterward with Black Coyote, one of the
Arapaho delegates and also a police officer, the same incident came
up, but with a very different sequel. Black Coyote told how they had
seated themselves on the ground in front of Wovoka, as described by
Tall Bull, and went on to tell how the messiah had waved his feathers
over his hat, and then, when he withdrew his hand, Black Coyote looked
into the hat and there “saw the whole world.” The explanation is
simple. Tall Bull, who has since been stricken with paralysis, was
a jovial, light-hearted fellow, fond of joking and playing tricks on
his associates, but withal a man of good hard sense and disposed to be
doubtful in regard to all medicine-men outside of his own tribe. Black
Coyote, on the contrary, is a man of contemplative disposition, much
given to speculation on the unseen world. His body and arms are covered
with the scars of wounds which he has inflicted on himself in obedience
to commands received in dreams. When the first news of the new religion
came to the southern tribes, he had made a long journey, at his own
expense, to his kindred in Wyoming, to learn the doctrine and the
songs, and since his return had been drilling his people day and night
in both. Now, on his visit to the fountain head of inspiration, he was
prepared for great things, and when the messiah performed his hypnotic
passes with the eagle feather, as I have so often witnessed in the
Ghost dance, Black Coyote saw the whole spirit world where Tall Bull
saw only an empty hat. From my knowledge of the men, I believe both
were honest in their statements.

As a result of the confidence established between the Indians and
myself in consequence of my visit to the messiah, one of the Cheyenne
delegates named Black Sharp Nose, a prominent man in his tribe, soon
after voluntarily brought down to me the written statement of the
doctrine obtained from the messiah himself, and requested me to take it
back and show it to Washington, to convince the white people that there
was nothing bad or hostile in the new religion. The paper had been
written by a young Arapaho of the same delegation who had learned some
English at the Carlisle Indian school, and it had been taken down on
the spot from the dictation of the messiah as his message to be carried
to the prairie tribes. On the reverse page of the paper the daughter
of Black Sharp Nose, a young woman who had also some school education,
had written out the same thing in somewhat better English from her
father’s dictation on his return. No white man had any part, directly
or indirectly, in its production, nor was it originally intended to be
seen by white men. In fact, in one part the messiah himself expressly
warns the delegates to tell no white man.




                              +Chapter X+

                    THE DOCTRINE OF THE GHOST DANCE

  You must not fight. Do no harm to anyone. Do right always.—_Wovoka._


The great underlying principle of the Ghost dance doctrine is that
the time will come when the whole Indian race, living and dead, will
be reunited upon a regenerated earth, to live a life of aboriginal
happiness, forever free from death, disease, and misery. On this
foundation each tribe has built a structure from its own mythology, and
each apostle and believer has filled in the details according to his
own mental capacity or ideas of happiness, with such additions as come
to him from the trance. Some changes, also, have undoubtedly resulted
from the transmission of the doctrine through the imperfect medium of
the sign language. The differences of interpretation are precisely such
as we find in Christianity, with its hundreds of sects and innumerable
shades of individual opinion. The white race, being alien and secondary
and hardly real, has no part in this scheme of aboriginal regeneration,
and will be left behind with the other things of earth that have served
their temporary purpose, or else will cease entirely to exist.

All this is to be brought about by an overruling spiritual power
that needs no assistance from human creatures; and though certain
medicine-men were disposed to anticipate the Indian millennium by
preaching resistance to the further encroachments of the whites, such
teachings form no part of the true doctrine, and it was only where
chronic dissatisfaction was aggravated by recent grievances, as among
the Sioux, that the movement assumed a hostile expression. On the
contrary, all believers were exhorted to make themselves worthy of the
predicted happiness by discarding all things warlike and practicing
honesty, peace, and good will, not only among themselves, but also
toward the whites, so long as they were together. Some apostles have
even thought that all race distinctions are to be obliterated, and that
the whites are to participate with the Indians in the coming felicity;
but it seems unquestionable that this is equally contrary to the
doctrine as originally preached.

Different dates have been assigned at various times for the fulfillment
of the prophecy. Whatever the year, it has generally been held, for
very natural reasons, that the regeneration of the earth and the
renewal of all life would occur in the early spring. In some cases
July, and particularly the 4th of July, was the expected time. This,
it may be noted, was about the season when the great annual ceremony
of the sun dance formerly took place among the prairie tribes. The
messiah himself has set several dates from time to time, as one
prediction after another failed to materialize, and in his message to
the Cheyenne and Arapaho, in August, 1891, he leaves the whole matter
an open question. The date universally recognized among all the tribes
immediately prior to the Sioux outbreak was the spring of 1891. As
springtime came and passed, and summer grew and waned, and autumn faded
again into winter without the realization of their hopes and longings,
the doctrine gradually assumed its present form—that some time in the
unknown future the Indian will be united with his friends who have gone
before, to be forever supremely happy, and that this happiness may be
anticipated in dreams, if not actually hastened in reality, by earnest
and frequent attendance on the sacred dance.

On returning to the Cheyenne and Arapaho in Oklahoma, after my visit
to Wovoka in January, 1892, I was at once sought by my friends of
both tribes, anxious to hear the report of my journey and see the
sacred things that I had brought back from the messiah. The Arapaho
especially, who are of more spiritual nature than any of the other
tribes, showed a deep interest and followed intently every detail of
the narrative. As soon as the news of my return was spread abroad, men
and women, in groups and singly, would come to me, and after grasping
my hand would repeat a long and earnest prayer, sometimes aloud,
sometimes with the lips silently moving, and frequently with tears
rolling down the cheeks, and the whole body trembling violently from
stress of emotion. Often before the prayer was ended the condition
of the devotee bordered on the hysterical, very little less than in
the Ghost dance itself. The substance of the prayer was usually an
appeal to the messiah to hasten the coming of the promised happiness,
with a petition that, as the speaker himself was unable to make the
long journey, he might, by grasping the hand of one who had seen and
talked with the messiah face to face, be enabled in his trance visions
to catch a glimpse of the coming glory. During all this performance
the bystanders awaiting their turn kept reverent silence. In a short
time it became very embarrassing, but until the story had been told
over and over again there was no way of escape without wounding
their feelings. The same thing afterward happened among the northern
Arapaho in Wyoming, one chief even holding out his hands toward me
with short exclamations of _hŭ! hŭ! hŭ!_ as is sometimes done by the
devotees about a priest in the Ghost dance, in the hope, as he himself
explained, that he might thus be enabled to go into a trance then and
there. The hope, however, was not realized.

After this preliminary ordeal my visitors would ask to see the things
which I had brought back from the messiah—the rabbit-skin robes, the
piñon nuts, the gaming sticks, the sacred magpie feathers, and, above
all, the sacred red paint. This is a bright-red ocher, about the color
of brick dust, which the Paiute procure from the neighborhood of
their sacred eminence, Mount Grant. It is ground, and by the help of
water is made into elliptical cakes about 6 inches in length. It is
the principal paint used by the Paiute in the Ghost dance, and small
portions of it are given by the messiah to all the delegates and are
carried back by them to their respective tribes, where it is mixed with
larger quantities of their own red paint and used in decorating the
faces of the participants in the dance, the painting being solemnly
performed for each dancer by the medicine-man himself. It is believed
to ward off sickness, to contribute to long life, and to assist the
mental vision in the trance. On the battlefield of Wounded Knee I have
seen this paint smeared on the posts of the inclosure about the trench
in which are buried the Indians killed in the fight. I found it very
hard to refuse the numerous requests for some of the paint, but as
I had only one cake myself I could not afford to be too liberal. My
friends were very anxious to touch it, however, but when I found that
every man tried to rub off as much of it as possible on the palms of
his hands, afterward smearing this dust on the faces of himself and his
family, I was obliged in self-defense to put it entirely away.

The piñon nuts, although not esteemed so sacred, were also the subject
of reverent curiosity. One evening, by invitation from Left Hand, the
principal chief of the Arapaho, I went over to his tipi to talk with
him about the messiah and his country, and brought with me a quantity
of the nuts for distribution. On entering I found the chief and a
number of the principal men ranged on one side of the fire, while his
wife and several other women, with his young grandchildren, completed
the circle on the other. Each of the adults in turn took my hand with
a prayer, as before described, varying in length and earnestness
according to the devotion of the speaker. This ceremony consumed a
considerable time. I then produced the piñon nuts and gave them to Left
Hand, telling him how they were used as food by the Paiute. He handed
a portion to his wife, and before I knew what was coming the two arose
in their places and stretching out their hands toward the northwest,
the country of the messiah, made a long and earnest prayer aloud that
_Hesûnanin_, “Our Father,” would bless themselves and their children
through the sacred food, and hasten the time of his coming. The others,
men and women, listened with bowed heads, breaking in from time to time
with similar appeals to “the Father.” The scene was deeply affecting.
It was another of those impressive exhibitions of natural religion
which it has been my fortune to witness among the Indians, and which
throw light on a side of their character of which the ordinary white
observer never dreams. After the prayer the nuts were carefully divided
among those present, down to the youngest infant, that all might taste
of what to them was the veritable bread of life.

As I had always shown a sympathy for their ideas and feelings, and had
now accomplished a long journey to the messiah himself at the cost of
considerable difficulty and hardship, the Indians were at last fully
satisfied that I was really desirous of learning the truth concerning
their new religion. A few days after my visit to Left Hand, several of
the delegates who had been sent out in the preceding August came down
to see me, headed by Black Short Nose, a Cheyenne. After preliminary
greetings, he stated that the Cheyenne and Arapaho were now convinced
that I would tell the truth about their religion, and as they loved
their religion and were anxious to have the whites know that it was
all good and contained nothing bad or hostile they would now give me
the message which the messiah himself had given to them, that I might
take it back to show to Washington. He then took from a beaded pouch
and gave to me a letter, which proved to be the message or statement of
the doctrine delivered by Wovoka to the Cheyenne and Arapaho delegates,
of whom Black Short Nose was one, on the occasion of their last visit
to Nevada, in August, 1891, and written down on the spot, in broken
English, by one of the Arapaho delegates, Casper Edson, a young man who
had acquired some English education by several years’ attendance at
the government Indian school at Carlisle, Pennsylvania. On the reverse
page of the paper was a duplicate in somewhat better English, written
out by a daughter of Black Short Nose, a school girl, as dictated by
her father on his return. These letters contained the message to be
delivered to the two tribes, and as is expressly stated in the text
were not intended to be seen by a white man. The daughter of Black
Short Nose had attempted to erase this clause before her father brought
the letter down to me, but the lines were still plainly visible. It is
the genuine official statement of the Ghost-dance doctrine as given
by the messiah himself to his disciples. It is reproduced here in
duplicate and verbatim, just as received, with a translation for the
benefit of those not accustomed to Carlisle English. In accordance
with the request of the Indians, I brought the original to Washington,
where it was read by the Indian Commissioner, Honorable T. J. Morgan,
after which I had two copies made, giving one to the commissioner and
retaining the other myself, returning the original to its owner, Black
Short Nose.

                _The Messiah Letter_ (_free Rendering_)

  When you get home you must make a dance to continue five days.
  Dance four successive nights, and the last night keep up the dance
  until the morning of the fifth day, when all must bathe in the
  river and then disperse to their homes. You must all do in the same

  Grandfather [a universal title of reverence among Indians and here
  meaning the messiah] says, when your friends die you must not cry.
  You must not hurt anybody or do harm to anyone. You must not fight.
  Do right always. It will give you satisfaction in life. This young
  man has a good father and mother. [Possibly this refers to Casper
  Edson, the young Arapaho who wrote down this message of Wovoka for
  the delegation].

  Do not tell the white people about this. Jesus is now upon the
  earth. He appears like a cloud. The dead are all alive again. I do
  not know when they will be here; maybe this fall or in the spring.
  When the time comes there will be no more sickness and everyone
  will be young again.

  Do not refuse to work for the whites and do not make any trouble
  with them until you leave them. When the earth shakes [at the
  coming of the new world] do not be afraid. It will not hurt you.

  I want you to dance every six weeks. Make a feast at the dance and
  have food that everybody may eat. Then bathe in the water. That is
  all. You will receive good words again from me some time. Do not
  tell lies.

Every organized religion has a system of ethics, a system of mythology,
and a system of ritual observance. In this message from the high priest
of the Ghost dance we have a synopsis of all three. With regard to
the ritual part, ceremonial purification and bathing have formed a
part in some form or other of every great religion from the beginning
of history, while the religious dance dates back far beyond the day
when the daughter of Saul “looked through a window and saw King David
leaping and dancing before the Lord.” The feasting enjoined is a
part of every Indian ceremonial gathering, religious, political, or
social. The dance is to continue four successive nights, in accord with
the regular Indian system, in which _four_ is the sacred number, as
_three_ is in Christianity. In obedience to this message the southern
prairie tribes, after the return of the delegation in August, 1891,
ceased to hold frequent one-night dances at irregular intervals as
formerly without the ceremonial bathing, and adopted instead a system
of four-night dances at regular periods of six weeks, followed by
ceremonial bathing on the morning of the fifth day.

The mythology of the doctrine is only briefly indicated, but the
principal articles are given. The dead are all arisen and the spirit
hosts are advancing and have already arrived at the boundaries of
this earth, led forward by the regenerator in shape of cloud-like
indistinctness. The spirit captain of the dead is always represented
under this shadowy semblance. The great change will be ushered in by a
trembling of the earth, at which the faithful are exhorted to feel no
alarm. The hope held out is the same that has inspired the Christian
for nineteen centuries—a happy immortality in perpetual youth. As
to fixing a date, the messiah is as cautious as his predecessor in
prophecy, who declares that “no man knoweth the time, not even the
angels of God.” His weather predictions also are about as definite as
the inspired utterances of the Delphian oracle.

The moral code inculcated is as pure and comprehensive in its
simplicity as anything found in religious systems from the days of
Gautama Buddha to the time of Jesus Christ. “_Do no harm to any one.
Do right always._” Could anything be more simple, and yet more exact
and exacting? It inculcates honesty—“_Do not tell lies._” It preaches
good will—“_Do no harm to any one._” It forbids the extravagant
mourning customs formerly common among the tribes—“_When your friends
die, you must not cry_,” which is interpreted by the prairie tribes as
forbidding the killing of horses, the burning of tipis and destruction
of property, the cutting off of the hair and the gashing of the body
with knives, all of which were formerly the sickening rule at every
death until forbidden by the new doctrine. As an Arapaho said to me
when his little boy died, “I shall not shoot any ponies, and my wife
will not gash her arms. We used to do this when our friends died,
because we thought we would never see them again, and it made us feel
bad. But now we know we shall all be united again.” If the Kiowa had
held to the Ghost-dance doctrine instead of abandoning it as they had
done, they would have been spared the loss of thousands of dollars in
horses, tipis, wagons, and other property destroyed, with much of the
mental suffering and all of the physical laceration that resulted in
consequence of the recent fatal epidemic in the tribe, when for weeks
and months the sound of wailing went up night and morning, and in every
camp men and women could be seen daily, with dress disordered and hair
cut close to the scalp, with blood hardened in clots upon the skin, or
streaming from mutilated fingers and fresh gashes on face, and arms,
and legs. It preaches peace with the whites and obedience to authority
until the day of deliverance shall come. Above all, it forbids
war—“_You must not fight._” It is hardly possible for us to realize the
tremendous and radical change which this doctrine works in the whole
spirit of savage life. The career of every Indian has been the warpath.
His proudest title has been that of warrior. His conversation by day
and his dreams by night have been of bloody deeds upon the enemies of
his tribe. His highest boast was in the number of his scalp trophies,
and his chief delight at home was in the war dance and the scalp dance.
The thirst for blood and massacre seemed inborn in every man, woman,
and child of every tribe. Now comes a prophet as a messenger from God
to forbid not only war, but all that savors of war—the war dance,
the scalp dance, and even the bloody torture of the sun dance—and
his teaching is accepted and his words obeyed by four-fifths of all
the warlike predatory tribes of the mountains and the great plains.
Only those who have known the deadly hatred that once animated Ute,
Cheyenne, and Pawnee, one toward another, and are able to contrast
it with their present spirit of mutual brotherly love, can know what
the Ghost-dance religion has accomplished in bringing the savage into
civilization. It is such a revolution as comes but once in the life of
a race.

The beliefs held among the various tribes in regard to the final
catastrophe are as fairly probable as some held on the same subject by
more orthodox authorities. As to the dance itself, with its scenes of
intense excitement, spasmodic action, and physical exhaustion even to
unconsciousness, such manifestations have always accompanied religious
upheavals among primitive peoples, and are not entirely unknown among
ourselves. In a country which produces magnetic healers, shakers,
trance mediums, and the like, all these things may very easily be
paralleled without going far from home.

In conclusion, we may say of the prophet and his doctrine what has been
said of one of his apostles by a careful and competent investigator:
“He has given these people a better religion than they ever had before,
taught them precepts which, if faithfully carried out, will bring them
into better accord with their white neighbors, and has prepared the way
for their final Christianization.” (_G. D., 4_, and _A. G. O., 5_.)

We may now consider details of the doctrine as held by different
tribes, beginning with the Paiute, among whom it originated. The best
account of the Paiute belief is contained in a report to the War
Department by Captain J. M. Lee, who was sent out in the autumn of 1890
to investigate the temper and fighting strength of the Paiute and other
Indians in the vicinity of Fort Bidwell in northeastern California.
We give the statement obtained by him from Captain Dick, a Paiute,
as delivered one day in a conversational way and apparently without
reserve, after nearly all the Indians had left the room:

  Long time, twenty years ago, Indian medicine-man in Mason’s
  valley at Walker lake talk same way, same as you hear now. In one
  year, maybe, after he begin talk he die. Three years ago another
  medicine-man begin same talk. Heap talk all time. Indians hear
  all about it everywhere. Indians come from long way off to hear
  him. They come from the east; they make signs. Two years ago me
  go to Winnemucca and Pyramid lake, me see Indian Sam, a head man,
  and Johnson Sides. Sam he tell me he just been to see Indian
  medicine-man to hear him talk. Sam say medicine-man talk this way:

  “All Indians must dance, everywhere, keep on dancing. Pretty soon
  in next spring Big Man [Great Spirit] come. He bring back all game
  of every kind. The game be thick everywhere. All dead Indians come
  back and live again. They all be strong just like young men, be
  young again. Old blind Indian see again and get young and have fine
  time. When Old Man [God] comes this way, then all the Indians go
  to mountains, high up away from whites. Whites can’t hurt Indians
  then. Then while Indians way up high, big flood comes like water
  and all white people die, get drowned. After that water go way and
  then nobody but Indians everywhere and game all kinds thick. Then
  medicine-man tell Indians to send word to all Indians to keep up
  dancing and the good time will come. Indians who don’t dance, who
  don’t believe in this word, will grow little, just about a foot
  high, and stay that way. Some of them will be turned into wood and
  be burned in fire.” That’s the way Sam tell me the medicine-man
  talk. (_A. G. O., 6._)

Lieutenant N. P. Phister, who gathered a part of the material embodied
in Captain Lee’s report, confirms this general statement and gives a
few additional particulars. The flood is to consist of mingled mud and
water, and when the faithful go up into the mountains, the skeptics
will be left behind and will be turned to stone. The prophet claims to
receive these revelations directly from God and the spirits of the dead
Indians during his trances. He asserts also that he is invulnerable,
and that if soldiers should attempt to kill him they would fall down as
if they had no bones and die, while he would still live, even though
cut into little pieces. (_Phister, 3._)

One of the first and most prominent of those who brought the doctrine
to the prairie tribes was Porcupine, a Cheyenne, who crossed the
mountains with several companions in the fall of 1889, visited Wovoka,
and attended the dance near Walker lake, Nevada. In his report of his
experiences, made some months later to a military officer, he states
that Wovoka claimed to be Christ himself, who had come back again, many
centuries after his first rejection, in pity to teach his children. He
quotes the prophet as saying:

  I found my children were bad, so I went back to heaven and left
  them, I told them that in so many hundred years I would come back
  to see my children. At the end of this time I was sent back to try
  to teach them. My father told me the earth was getting old and worn
  out and the people getting bad, and that I was to renew everything
  as it used to be and make it better.

  He also told us that all our dead were to be resurrected; that
  they were all to come back to earth, and that, as the earth was
  too small for them and us, he would do away with heaven and make
  the earth itself large enough to contain us all; that we must tell
  all the people we met about these things. He spoke to us about
  fighting, and said that was bad and we must keep from it; that the
  earth was to be all good hereafter, and we must all be friends with
  one another. He said that in the fall of the year the youth of all
  good people would be renewed, so that nobody would be more than
  forty years old, and that if they behaved themselves well after
  this the youth of everyone would be renewed in the spring. He said
  if we were all good he would send people among us who could heal
  all our wounds and sickness by mere touch and that we would live
  forever. He told us not to quarrel or fight or strike each other,
  or shoot one another; that the whites and Indians were to be all
  one people. He said if any man disobeyed what he ordered his tribe
  would be wiped from the face of the earth; that we must believe
  everything he said, and we must not doubt him or say he lied; that
  if we did, he would know it; that he would know our thoughts and
  actions in no matter what part of the world we might be. (_G. D.,
  5._)

Here we have the statement that both races are to live together as one.
We have also the doctrine of healing by touch. Whether or not this is
an essential part of the system is questionable, but it is certain that
the faithful believe that great physical good comes to them, to their
children, and to the sick from the imposition of hands by the priests
of the dance, apart from the ability thus conferred to see the things
of the spiritual world.

Another idea here presented, namely, that the earth becomes old and
decrepit, and requires that its youth be renewed at the end of certain
great cycles, is common to a number of tribes, and has an important
place in the oldest religions of the world. As an Arapaho who spoke
English expressed it, “This earth too old, grass too old, trees too
old, our lives too old. Then all be new again.” Captain H. L. Scott
also found among the southern plains tribes the same belief that the
rivers, the mountains, and the earth itself are worn out and must be
renewed, together with an indefinite idea that both races alike must
die at the same time, to be resurrected in new but separate worlds.

The Washo, Pit River, Bannock, and other tribes adjoining the Paiute
on the north and west hold the doctrine substantially as taught by the
messiah himself. We have but little light in regard to the belief as
held by the Walapai, Cohonino, Mohave, and Navaho to the southward,
beyond the general fact that the resurrection and return of the dead
formed the principal tenet. As these tribes received their knowledge of
the new religion directly from Paiute apostles, it is quite probable
that they made but few changes in or additions to the original gospel.

A witness of the dance among the Walapai in 1891 obtained from the
leaders of the ceremony about the same statement of doctrine already
mentioned as held by the Paiute, from whom also the Walapai had adopted
many of the songs and ceremonial words used in connection with the
dance. They were then expecting the Indian redeemer to appear on earth
some time within three or four years. They were particularly anxious
to have it understood that their intentions were not hostile toward
the whites and that they desired to live in peace with them until the
redeemer came, but that then they would be unable to prevent their
destruction even if they wished. (_J. F. L., 3._)

The manner of the final change and the destruction of the whites
has been variously interpreted as the doctrine was carried from its
original center. East of the mountains it is commonly held that a deep
sleep will come on the believers, during which the great catastrophe
will be accomplished, and the faithful will awake to immortality on a
new earth. The Shoshoni of Wyoming say this sleep will continue four
days and nights, and that on the morning of the fifth day all will
open their eyes in a new world where both races will dwell together
forever. The Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, and others, of Oklahoma, say
that the new earth, with all the resurrected dead from the beginning,
and with the buffalo, the elk, and other game upon it, will come from
the west and slide over the surface of the present earth, as the right
hand might slide over the left. As it approaches, the Indians will be
carried upward and alight on it by the aid of the sacred dance feathers
which they wear in their hair and which will act as wings to bear them
up. They will then become unconscious for four days, and on waking out
of their trance will find themselves with their former friends in the
midst of all the oldtime surroundings. By Sitting Bull, the Arapaho
apostle, it is thought that this new earth as it advances will be
preceded by a wall of fire which will drive the whites across the water
to their original and proper country, while the Indians will be enabled
by means of the sacred feathers to surmount the flames and reach the
promised land. When the expulsion of the whites has been accomplished,
the fire will be extinguished by a rain continuing twelve days. By a
few it is believed that a hurricane with thunder and lightning will
come to destroy the whites alone. This last idea is said to be held
also by the Walapai of Arizona, who extend its provisions to include
the unbelieving Indians as well. (_G. D., 6._) The doctrine held by
the Caddo, Wichita, and Delaware, of Oklahoma, is practically the same
as is held by the Arapaho and Cheyenne from whom they obtained it. All
these tribes believe that the destruction or removal of the whites is
to be accomplished entirely by supernatural means, and they severely
blame the Sioux for having provoked a physical conflict by their
impatience instead of waiting for their God to deliver them in his own
good time.

Among all the tribes which have accepted the new faith it is held that
frequent devout attendance on the dance conduces to ward off disease
and restore the sick to health, this applying not only to the actual
participants, but also to their children and friends. The idea of
obtaining temporal blessings as the reward of a faithful performance
of religious duties is too natural and universal to require comment.
The purification by the sweat-bath, which forms an important
preliminary to the dance among the Sioux, while devotional in its
purpose, is probably also sanitary in its effect.

Among the powerful and warlike Sioux of the Dakotas, already restless
under both old and recent grievances, and more lately brought to the
edge of starvation by a reduction of rations, the doctrine speedily
assumed a hostile meaning and developed some peculiar features, for
which reason it deserves particular notice as concerns this tribe. The
earliest rumors of the new messiah came to the Sioux from the more
western tribes in the winter of 1888–89, but the first definite account
was brought by a delegation which crossed the mountains to visit the
messiah in the fall of 1889, returning in the spring of 1890. On the
report of these delegates the dance was at once inaugurated and spread
so rapidly that in a few months the new religion had been accepted by
the majority of the tribe.

Perhaps the best statement of the Sioux version is given by the veteran
agent, James McLaughlin, of Standing Rock agency. In an official letter
of October 17, 1890, he writes that the Sioux, under the influence
of Sitting Bull, were greatly excited over the near approach of a
predicted Indian millennium or “return of the ghosts,” when the white
man would be annihilated and the Indian again supreme, and which the
medicine-men had promised was to occur as soon as the grass was green
in the spring. They were told that the Great Spirit had sent upon
them the dominant race to punish them for their sins, and that their
sins were now expiated and the time of deliverance was at hand. Their
decimated ranks were to be reinforced by all the Indians who had ever
died, and these spirits were already on their way to reinhabit the
earth, which had originally belonged to the Indians, and were driving
before them, as they advanced, immense herds of buffalo and fine
ponies. The Great Spirit, who had so long deserted his red children,
was now once more with them and against the whites, and the white man’s
gunpowder would no longer have power to drive a bullet through the
skin of an Indian. The whites themselves would soon be overwhelmed and
smothered under a deep landslide, held down by sod and timber, and the
few who might escape would become small fishes in the rivers. In order
to bring about this happy result, the Indians must believe and organize
the Ghost dance.

The agent continues:

  It would seem impossible that any person, no matter how ignorant,
  could be brought to believe such absurd nonsense, but as a matter
  of fact a great many Indians of this agency actually believe it,
  and since this new doctrine has been ingrafted here from the more
  southern Sioux agencies the infection has been wonderful, and
  so pernicious that it now includes some of the Indians who were
  formerly numbered with the progressive and more intelligent, and
  many of our very best Indians appear dazed and undecided when
  talking of it, their inherent superstition having been thoroughly
  aroused. (_G. D., 7._)

The following extract is from a translation of a letter dated March
30, 1891, written in Sioux by an Indian at Pine Ridge to a friend at
Rosebud agency:

  And now I will tell another thing. Lately there is a man died and
  come to life again, and he say he has been to Indian nation of
  ghosts, and tells us dead Indian nation all coming home. The Indian
  ghost tell him come after his war bonnet. The Indian (not ghost
  Indian) gave him his war bonnet and he died again. (_G. D., 8._)

The Sioux, like other tribes, believed that at the moment of the
catastrophe the earth would tremble. According to one version the
landslide was to be accompanied by a flood of water, which would flow
into the mouths of the whites and cause them to choke with mud. Storms
and whirlwinds were also to assist in their destruction. The Indians
were to surmount the avalanche, probably in the manner described in
speaking of the southern tribes, and on reaching the surface of the
new earth would behold boundless prairies covered with long grass and
filled with great herds of buffalo and other game. When the time was
near at hand, they must assemble at certain places of rendezvous and
prepare for the final abandonment of all earthly things by stripping
off their clothing. In accordance with the general idea of a return to
aboriginal habits, the believers, as far as possible, discarded white
man’s dress and utensils. Those who could procure buckskin—which is
now very scarce in the Sioux country—resumed buckskin dress, while the
dancers put on “ghost shirts” made of cloth, but cut and ornamented
in Indian fashion. No metal of any kind was allowed in the dance,
no knives, and not even the earrings or belts of imitation silver
which form such an important part of prairie Indian costume. This was
at variance with the custom among the Cheyenne and other southern
tribes, where the women always wear in the dance their finest belts
studded with large disks of German silver. The beads used so freely on
moccasins and leggings seem to have been regarded as a substitute for
the oldtime wampum and porcupine quill work, and were therefore not
included in the prohibition. No weapon of any kind was allowed to be
carried in the Ghost dance by any tribe, north or south, a fact which
effectually disposes of the assertion that this was another variety of
war dance. At certain of the Sioux dances, however, sacred arrows and a
sacred bow, with other things, were tied on the tree in the center of
the circle.

  SIOUX GHOST SHIRTS FROM WOUNDED KNEE BATTLEFIELD]

                      EXPLANATION OF PLATE XCIII

  The originals of these ghost shirts, now in the National Museum,
  were taken, by scouts present during the fight, from the bodies of
  Indians killed at Wounded Knee, and were obtained by the author,
  at Pine Ridge, from Philip Wells and Louis Menard, mixed-blood
  interpreters, the former having also been present as interpreter
  for the Indian scouts during the fight. They are made of coarse
  white cloth, sewn with sinew. One of the shirts is partially
  burned, having probably been taken out of one of the tipis
  overturned and set on fire during the action. Two other ghost
  shirts, said to be from the same battlefield, are also in the
  National Museum.

Valuable light in regard to the Sioux version of the doctrine is
obtained from the sermon delivered at Red Leaf camp, on Pine Ridge
reservation, October 31, 1890, by Short Bull, one of those who had been
selected to visit the messiah, and who afterward became one of the
prime leaders in the dance:

  My friends and relations: I will soon start this thing in running
  order. I have told you that this would come to pass in two seasons,
  but since the whites are interfering so much, I will advance the
  time from what my father above told me to do, so the time will be
  shorter. Therefore you must not be afraid of anything. Some of my
  relations have no ears, so I will have them blown away.

  Now, there will be a tree sprout up, and there all the members of
  our religion and the tribe must gather together. That will be the
  place where we will see our dead relations. But before this time
  we must dance the balance of this moon, at the end of which time
  the earth will shiver very hard. Whenever this thing occurs, I
  will start the wind to blow. We are the ones who will then see our
  fathers, mothers, and everybody. We, the tribe of Indians, are the
  ones who are living a sacred life. God, our father himself, has
  told and commanded and shown me to do these things.

  Our father in heaven has placed a mark at each point of the four
  winds. First, a clay pipe, which lies at the setting of the sun and
  represents the Sioux tribe. Second, there is a holy arrow lying
  at the north, which represents the Cheyenne tribe. Third, at the
  rising of the sun there lies hail, representing the Arapaho tribe.
  Fourth, there lies a pipe and nice feather at the south, which
  represents the Crow tribe. My father has shown me these things,
  therefore we must continue this dance. If the soldiers surround you
  four deep, three of you, on whom I have put holy shirts, will sing
  a song, which I have taught you, around them, when some of them
  will drop dead. Then the rest will start to run, but their horses
  will sink into the earth. The riders will jump from their horses,
  but they will sink into the earth also. Then you can do as you
  desire with them. Now, you must know this, that all the soldiers
  and that race will be dead. There will be only five thousand of
  them left living on the earth. My friends and relations, this is
  straight and true.

  Now, we must gather at Pass creek where the tree is sprouting.
  There we will go among our dead relations. You must not take any
  earthly things with you. Then the men must take off all their
  clothing and the women must do the same. No one shall be ashamed of
  exposing their persons. My father above has told us to do this, and
  we must do as he says. You must not be afraid of anything. The guns
  are the only things we are afraid of, but they belong to our father
  in heaven. He will see that they do no harm. Whatever white men may
  tell you, do not listen to them, my relations. This is all. I will
  now raise my hand up to my father and close what he has said to you
  through me. (_Short Bull; War, 4._)

The pipe here referred to is the most sacred thing in Sioux mythology
and will be more fully described in treating of the Sioux songs. The
sacred object of the Cheyenne is the “medicine arrow,” now in the
keeping of the band living near Cantonment, Oklahoma. The Crow and
Arapaho references are not so clear. The Arapaho are called by the
Sioux the “Blue Cloud” people, a name which may possibly have some
connection with hail. The sprouting tree at which all the believers
must gather refers to the tree or pole which the Sioux planted in the
center of the dance circle. The cardinal directions here assigned to
the other tribes may refer to their former locations with regard to the
Sioux. The Cheyenne and Arapaho, who now live far west and south of the
Sioux, originally lived north and east of them, about Red river and the
Saskatchewan.

The most noted thing connected with the Ghost dance among the Sioux is
the “ghost shirt” which was worn by all adherents of the doctrine—men,
women, and children alike. It is described by Captain Sword in his
account of the Ghost dance, given in the appendix to this chapter, and
will be noticed at length hereafter in treating of the ceremony of the
dance. During the dance it was worn as an outside garment, but was
said to be worn at other times under the ordinary dress. Although the
shape, fringing, and feather adornment were practically the same in
every case, considerable variation existed in regard to the painting,
the designs on some being very simple, while the others were fairly
covered with representations of sun, moon, stars, the sacred things of
their mythology, and the visions of the trance. The feathers attached
to the garment were always those of the eagle, and the thread used in
the sewing was always the old-time sinew. In some cases the fringe or
other portions were painted with the sacred red paint of the messiah.
The shirt was firmly believed to be impenetrable to bullets or weapons
of any sort. When one of the women shot in the Wounded Knee massacre
was approached as she lay in the church and told that she must let them
remove her ghost shirt in order the better to get at her wound, she
replied: “Yes; take it off. They told me a bullet would not go through.
Now I don’t want it any more.”

The protective idea in connection with the ghost shirt does not seem
to be aboriginal. The Indian warrior habitually went into battle naked
above the waist. His protecting “medicine” was a feather, a tiny bag
of some sacred powder, the claw of an animal, the head of a bird, or
some other small object which could be readily twisted into his hair or
hidden between the covers of his shield without attracting attention.
Its virtue depended entirely on the ceremony of the consecration and
not on size or texture. The war paint had the same magic power of
protection. To cover the body in battle was not in accordance with
Indian usage, which demanded that the warrior should be as free and
unincumbered in movement as possible. The so-called “war shirt” was
worn chiefly in ceremonial dress parades and only rarely on the warpath.

Dreams are but incoherent combinations of waking ideas, and there is a
hint of recollection even in the wildest visions of sleep. The ghost
shirt may easily have been an inspiration from a trance, while the
trance vision itself was the result of ideas derived from previous
observation or report. The author is strongly inclined to the opinion
that the idea of an invulnerable sacred garment is not original with
the Indians, but, like several other important points pertaining to
the Ghost-dance doctrine, is a practical adaptation by them of ideas
derived from contact with some sectarian body among the whites. It may
have been suggested by the “endowment robe” of the Mormons, a seamless
garment of white muslin adorned with symbolic figures, which is worn
by their initiates as the most sacred badge of their faith, and by
many of the believers is supposed to render the wearer invulnerable.
The Mormons have always manifested a particular interest in the
Indians, whom they regard as the Lamanites of their sacred writings,
and hence have made special efforts for their evangelization, with
the result that a considerable number of the neighboring tribes of
Ute, Paiute, Bannock, and Shoshoni have been received into the Mormon
church and invested with the endowment robe. (See the appendix to
this chapter: “The Mormons and the Indians;” also “Tell It All,” by
Mrs T. B. H. Stenhouse.) The Shoshoni and northern Arapaho occupy the
same reservation in Wyoming, and anything which concerns one tribe
is more or less talked of by the other. As the Sioux, Cheyenne, and
other eastern tribes make frequent visits to the Arapaho, and as these
Arapaho have been the great apostles of the Ghost dance, it is easy
to see how an idea borrowed by the Shoshoni from the Mormons could
find its way through the Arapaho first to the Sioux and Cheyenne and
afterward to more remote tribes. Wovoka himself expressly disclaimed
any responsibility for the ghost shirt, and whites and Indians alike
agreed that it formed no part of the dance costume in Mason valley.
When I first went among the Cheyenne and neighboring tribes of Oklahoma
in January, 1891, the ghost shirt had not yet reached them. Soon
afterward the first one was brought down from the Sioux country by a
Cheyenne named White Buffalo, who had been a Carlisle student, but the
Arapaho and Cheyenne, after debating the matter, refused to allow it
to be worn in the dance, on the ground that the doctrine of the Ghost
dance was one of peace, whereas the Sioux had made the ghost shirt an
auxiliary of war. In consequence of this decision such shirts have
never been worn by the dancers among the southern tribes. Instead they
wear in the dance their finest shirts and dresses of buckskin, covered
with painted and beaded figures from the Ghost-dance mythology and the
visions of the trance.

The Ghost dance is variously named among the different tribes. In
its original home among the Paiute it is called _Nänigükwa_, “dance
in a circle” (_nüka_, dance), to distinguish it from the other
dances of the tribe, which have only the ordinary up-and-down step
without the circular movement. The Shoshoni call it _Tänä′räyün_
or _Tämanä′rayära_, which may be rendered “everybody dragging,” in
allusion to the manner in which the dancers move around the circle
holding hands, as children do in their ring games. They insist that it
is a revival of a similar dance which existed among them fifty years
ago. The Comanche call it _A′p-anĕka′ra_, “the Father’s dance,” or
sometimes the dance “with joined hands.” The Kiowa call it _Mânposo′ti
guan_, “dance with clasped hands,” and the frenzy, _guan â′dalka-i_,
“dance craziness.” The Caddo know it as _Ă′ă kakĭ′mbawi′ut_, “the
prayer of all to the Father,” or as the _Nänisana ka-au′-shan_,
“nänisana dance,” from _nänisana_, “my children,” which forms the
burden of so many of the ghost songs in the language of the Arapaho,
from whom they obtained the dance. By the Sioux, Arapaho, and most
other prairie tribes it is called the “spirit” or “ghost” dance (Sioux,
_Wana′ghi wa′chipi_; Arapaho, _Thigû′nawat_), from, the fact that
everything connected with it relates to the coming of the spirits of
the dead from the spirit world, and by this name it has become known
among the whites.


                               APPENDIX


                      THE MORMONS AND THE INDIANS

While the Indian excitement was at its height in 1892, a curious
pamphlet was published anonymously at Salt Lake City in connection
with a proposed series of lectures, from which we make some extracts
for the light they give on the Mormon attitude toward the Indians. The
pamphlet is headed, “The Mormons have stepped down and out of Celestial
Government—the American Indians have stepped up and into Celestial
Government.” It begins by stating that the Messiah came to His people
at the time appointed of the Father—March, 1890—notwithstanding the
assertion in the Deseret Evening News, made January, 1892: “1890 has
passed, and no Messiah has come.” It goes on to say:

  “1891 has passed, and no pruning of the vineyard.” The vineyard
  of the Lord is the house of Israel.—Isa. 5:7. In the part of
  the vineyard the American Indians, descendants of the righteous
  branch of Joseph, who were led to the Western Continent or
  hemisphere—Zion—we find the vine, the stone-power of the Latter
  Days. Ps. 80.

  The celestial prophet, seer, and revelator, Joseph Smith, jr.,
  prophesied on the 2d of April, 1843, that the Messiah would reveal
  himself to man in mortality in 1890. Doctrine and Covenants, 130,
  15, 17, which reads: “I was once praying very earnestly to know
  the time of the coming of the Son of Man, when I heard a voice
  speak the following: ‘Joseph, my son, if thou livest until thou art
  eighty-five years old, thou shalt see the face of the Son of Man.’”

                   *       *       *       *       *

  Five years later (than 1882) the sign that was to usher in the
  work of the Father was given to the American Indians, while March,
  1890, witnesses the organization of a church under the restored
  order, where twelve disciples were chosen and ordained, whose first
  allegiance is given irrevocably to the Lord God, whereas that of
  the Celestial Church is given to the government fostering it.

                   *       *       *       *       *

  The following seven signs were to precede the fullness of the
  Gentiles upon the land of America; Zion, the time, place, and
  parties given with each. [The first, second, and third “signs” are
  omitted here.]

  4. When the Bible and Book of Mormon become one in the hands of the
  Messiah. Ezk. 37:19; III Nephi, 21:1–7. In 1887, sixty years after
  the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, jr., the Book of Mormon
  in Spanish was delivered to the American Indians, with the promise
  to those who are identified with the Gentiles that if they will not
  harden their hearts, but will repent and know the true points of my
  doctrine they shall be numbered with my covenant people, the Branch
  of Joseph. Doctrine and Covenant, 19:59–62; 20:8–17; III Nephi,
  21:1–7.

  5. The coming of the Messiah. Three years later, March, 1890,
  the people of God, who were notified by the three Nephites, met
  at Walkers lake, Esmeralda county, Nevada, where a dispensation
  of the Celestial kingdom of God—the gospel in the covenant of
  consecration, a perfect oneness in all things, temporal and
  spiritual—was given unto them. Twelve disciples were ordained, not
  by angels or men, but by the Messiah, in the presence of hundreds,
  representing scores of tribes or nations, who saw his face, heard
  and understood his voice as on the day of pentecost. Acts 2,
  also fulfilling sec. 90:9, 10, 11 of Doctrine and Covenant. Ezk.
  20:33–37.

  6. The Fulness of the Gentiles. In 1492, the Lord God let His
  vineyard to the nations of the Gentiles, to punish His people the
  Branch of Joseph for 400 years (Gen. 15:13), bringing the fulness
  of the Gentiles the end of their rule over the American Indians.
  October, 1892, Rom. II: 25–26; Gen. 50:25; New Trans. Matt.
  21:33–41.

  7. The Pruning of the Vineyard. The husbandmen upon this land began
  the last pruning of the vineyard in 1891. Prominent among which
  stands our government in fulfilling Matt. 21:33–41, saying, let us
  kill the heirs and hold the inheritance, as shown in the massacre
  of Wounded Knee; the butchery of Sitting Bull; the imprisonment
  of Short Bull and others; the breaking up of reservations, and
  the attempts to destroy the treaty stipulations above mentioned
  by forcing the mark of the Beast, citizenship and statehood, upon
  the American Indians, which will ultimately terminate in a war of
  extermination. Isa. 10:24–27; Dan. 2:34; Isa. 14:21.

  According to the astronomical, prophetic, and historical evidence
  found in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants for
  the redemption of Zion and the restoration of Israel, there are
  seven celestial keys of powers to be used which can not be handled
  by apostles, prophets, or angels. They can only be handled by the
  Messiah and his Father.

                   *       *       *       *       *

  2. The key of power that restores the heirs, the American Indians,
  to their own lands consecrating to them the wealth of the Gentiles.

  3. The key of power that turns away ungodliness from Jacob (the
  American Indians) enabling them to build the temple on the spot
  pointed out by the finger of God (Independence, Jackson County,
  Missouri), on which the true sign of Israel is to rest, the glory
  of the living God of the Hebrews, the cloud by day and the pillar
  of fire by night by the close of this generation, 1896.

                   *       *       *       *       *

  On and after July 10, 1892, free lectures illustrated by figures,
  will be given weekly, on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, from 6.30
  to 8.30 p. m. (weather permitting), at the book stand in the

                  PORCUPINE’S ACCOUNT OF THE MESSIAH

The following statement was made to Major Carroll, in command of Camp
Crook, at Tongue River agency, Montana, June 15, 1890, and transmitted
through the War Department to the Indian Office:

  In November last [1889] I left the reservation with two other
  Cheyennes. I went through [Fort] Washakie and took the Union
  Pacific railroad at Rawlins. We got on early in the morning about
  breakfast, rode all day on the railroad, and about dark reached a
  fort [Bridger?]. I stayed there two days, and then took a passenger
  train, and the next morning got to Fort Hall. I found some lodges
  of Snakes and Bannocks there. I saw the agent here, and he told me
  I could stay at the agency, but the chief of the Bannocks who was
  there took me to his camp near by. The Bannocks told me they were
  glad to see a Cheyenne and that we ought to make a treaty with the
  Bannocks.

  The chief told me he had been to Washington and had seen the
  President, and that we ought all to be friends with the whites
  and live at peace with them and with each other. We talked these
  matters over for ten days. The agent then sent for me and some
  of the Bannocks and Shoshones, and asked me where I was going. I
  told him I was just traveling to meet other Indians and see other
  countries; that my people were at peace with the whites, and I
  thought I could travel anywhere I wished. He asked me why I did
  not have a pass. I said because my agent would not give me one. He
  said he was glad to see me anyhow, and that the whites and Indians
  were all friends. Then he asked me where I wanted a pass to. I
  told him I wanted to go further and some Bannocks and Shoshones
  wanted to go along. He gave passes—five of them—to the chiefs of
  the three parties. We took the railroad to a little town near by,
  and then took a narrow-gauge road. We went on this, riding all
  night at a very fast rate of speed, and came to a town on a big
  lake [Ogden or Salt Lake City]. We stayed there one day, taking
  the cars at night, rode all night, and the next morning about 9
  oclock saw a settlement of Indians. We traveled south, going on
  a narrow-gauge road. We got off at this Indian town. The Indians
  here were different from any Indians I ever saw. The women and men
  were dressed in white people’s clothes, the women having their hair
  banged. These Indians had their faces painted white with black
  spots. We stayed with these people all day. We took the same road
  at night and kept on. We traveled all night, and about daylight
  we saw a lot of houses, and they told us there were a lot more
  Indians there; so we got off, and there is where we saw Indians
  living in huts of grass [tulé?]. We stopped here and got something
  to eat. There were whites living near by. We got on the cars again
  at night, and during the night we got off among some Indians, who
  were fish-eaters [Paiute]. We stayed among the Fish-eaters till
  morning, and then got into a wagon with the son of the chief of the
  Fish-eaters, and we arrived about noon at an agency on a big river.
  There was also a big lake near the agency.

  The agent asked us where we were from and said we were a long ways
  from home, and that he would write to our agent and let him know we
  were all right. From this agency we went back to the station, and
  they told us there were some more Indians to the south. One of the
  chiefs of the Fish-eaters then furnished us with four wagons. We
  traveled all day, and then came to another railroad. We left our
  wagons here and took the railroad, the Fish-eaters telling us there
  were some more Indians along the railroad who wanted to see us. We
  took this railroad about 2 oclock and about sun down got to another
  agency, where there were more Fish-eaters. [From diagrams drawn
  and explanations given of them in addition to the foregoing, there
  seems to be no doubt that the lakes visited are Pyramid and Walker
  lakes, western Nevada, and the agencies those of the same name.]

  They told us they had heard from the Shoshone agency that the
  people in this country were all bad people, but that they were
  good people there. All the Indians from the Bannock agency down to
  where I finally stopped danced this dance [referring to the late
  religious dances at the Cheyenne agency], the whites often dancing
  it themselves. [It will be recollected that he traveled constantly
  through the Mormon country.] I knew nothing about this dance before
  going. I happened to run across it, that is all. I will tell you
  about it. [Here all the Indian auditors removed their hats in token
  that the talk to follow was to be on a religious subject.] I want
  you all to listen to this, so that there will be no mistake. There
  is no harm in what I am to say to anyone. I heard this where I met
  my friends in Nevada. It is a wonder you people never heard this
  before. In the dance we had there [Nevada] the whites and Indians
  danced together. I met there a great many kinds of people, but
  they all seemed to know all about this religion. The people there
  seemed all to be good. I never saw any drinking or fighting or bad
  conduct among them. They treated me well on the cars, without pay.
  They gave me food without charge, and I found that this was a habit
  among them toward their neighbors. I thought it strange that the
  people there should have been so good, so different from those here.

  What I am going to say is the truth. The two men sitting near me
  were with me, and will bear witness that I speak the truth. I and
  my people have been living in ignorance until I went and found out
  the truth. All the whites and Indians are brothers, I was told
  there. I never knew this before.

  The Fish-eaters near Pyramid lake told me that Christ had appeared
  on earth again. They said Christ knew he was coming; that eleven
  of his children were also coming from a far land. It appeared that
  Christ had sent for me to go there, and that was why unconsciously
  I took my journey. It had been foreordained. Christ had summoned
  myself and others from all heathen tribes, from two to three or
  four from each of fifteen or sixteen different tribes. There were
  more different languages than I ever heard before and I did not
  understand any of them. They told me when I got there that my great
  father was there also, but did not know who he was. The people
  assembled called a council, and the chief’s son went to see the
  Great Father [messiah], who sent word to us to remain fourteen days
  in that camp and that he would come to see us. He sent me a small
  package of something white to eat that I did not know the name of.
  There were a great many people in the council, and this white food
  was divided among them. The food was a big white nut. Then I went
  to the agency at Walker lake and they told us Christ would be there
  in two days. At the end of two days, on the third morning, hundreds
  of people gathered at this place. They cleared off a place near the
  agency in the form of a circus ring and we all gathered there. This
  space was perfectly cleared of grass, etc. We waited there till
  late in the evening anxious to see Christ. Just before sundown I
  saw a great many people, mostly Indians, coming dressed in white
  men’s clothes. The Christ was with them. They all formed in this
  ring around it. They put up sheets all around the circle, as they
  had no tents. Just after dark some of the Indians told me that
  the Christ [Father] was arrived. I looked around to find him, and
  finally saw him sitting on one side of the ring. They all started
  toward him to see him. They made a big fire to throw light on him.
  I never looked around, but went forward, and when I saw him I bent
  my head. I had always thought the Great Father was a white man, but
  this man looked like an Indian. He sat there a long time and nobody
  went up to speak to him. He sat with his head bowed all the time.
  After awhile he rose and said he was very glad to see his children.
  “I have sent for you and am glad to see you. I am going to talk to
  you after awhile about your relatives who are dead and gone. My
  children, I want you to listen to all I have to say to you. I will
  teach you, too, how to dance a dance, and I want you to dance it.
  Get ready for your dance and then, when the dance is over, I will
  talk to you.” He was dressed in a white coat with stripes. The rest
  of his dress was a white man’s except that he had on a pair of
  moccasins. Then he commenced our dance, everybody joining in, the
  Christ singing while we danced. We danced till late in the night,
  when he told us we had danced enough.

  The next morning, after breakfast was over, we went into the circle
  and spread canvas over it on the ground, the Christ standing in the
  midst of us. He told us he was going away that day, but would be
  back that next morning and talk to us.

  In the night when I first saw him I thought he was an Indian, but
  the next day when I could see better he looked different. He was
  not so dark as an Indian, nor so light as a white man. He had no
  beard or whiskers, but very heavy eyebrows. He was a good-looking
  man. We were crowded up very close. We had been told that nobody
  was to talk, and even if we whispered the Christ would know it. I
  had heard that Christ had been crucified, and I looked to see, and
  I saw a scar on his wrist and one on his face, and he seemed to be
  the man. I could not see his feet. He would talk to us all day.

  That evening we all assembled again to see him depart. When we were
  assembled, he began to sing, and he commenced to tremble all over,
  violently for a while, and then sat down. We danced all that night,
  the Christ lying down beside us apparently dead.

  The next morning when we went to eat breakfast, the Christ was with
  us. After breakfast four heralds went around and called out that
  the Christ was back with us and wanted to talk with us. The circle
  was prepared again. The people assembled, and Christ came among us
  and sat down. He said he wanted to talk to us again and for us to
  listen. He said: “I am the man who made everything you see around
  you. I am not lying to you, my children. I made this earth and
  everything on it. I have been to heaven and seen your dead friends
  and have seen my own father and mother. In the beginning, after God
  made the earth, they sent me back to teach the people, and when
  I came back on earth the people were afraid of me and treated me
  badly. This is what they did to me [showing his scars]. I did not
  try to defend myself. I found my children were bad, so went back to
  heaven and left them. I told them that in so many hundred years I
  would come back to see my children. At the end of this time I was
  sent back to try to teach them. My father told me the earth was
  getting old and worn out, and the people getting bad, and that I
  was to renew everything as it used to be, and make it better.”

  He told us also that all our dead were to be resurrected; that they
  were all to come back to earth, and that as the earth was too small
  for them and us, he would do away with heaven, and make the earth
  itself large enough to contain us all; that we must tell all the
  people we meet about these things. He spoke to us about fighting,
  and said that was bad, and we must keep from it; that the earth
  was to be all good hereafter, and we must all be friends with one
  another. He said that in the fall of the year the youth of all the
  good people would be renewed, so that nobody would be more than 40
  years old, and that if they behaved themselves well after this the
  youth of everyone would be renewed in the spring. He said if we
  were all good he would send people among us who could heal all our
  wounds and sickness by mere touch, and that we would live forever.
  He told us not to quarrel, or fight, nor strike each other, nor
  shoot one another; that the whites and Indians were to be all one
  people. He said if any man disobeyed what he ordered, his tribe
  would be wiped from the face of the earth; that we must believe
  everything he said, and that we must not doubt him, or say he lied;
  that if we did, he would know it; that he would know our thoughts
  and actions, in no matter what part of the world we might be.

  When I heard this from the Christ, and came back home to tell it to
  my people, I thought they would listen. Where I went to there were
  lots of white people, but I never had one of them say an unkind
  word to me. I thought all of your people knew all of this I have
  told you of, but it seems you do not.

  Ever since the Christ I speak of talked to me I have thought what
  he said was good. I see nothing bad in it. When I got back, I knew
  my people were bad, and had heard nothing of all this, so I got
  them together and told them of it and warned them to listen to it
  for their own good. I talked to them for four nights and five days.
  I told them just what I have told you here today. I told them what
  I said were the words of God Almighty, who was looking down on
  them. I wish some of you had been up in our camp here to have heard
  my words to the Cheyennes. The only bad thing that there has been
  in it at all was this: I had just told my people that the Christ
  would visit the sins of any Indian upon the whole tribe, when the
  recent trouble [killing of Ferguson] occurred. If any one of you
  think I am not telling the truth, you can go and see this man I
  speak of for yourselves. I will go with you, and I would like one
  or two of my people who doubt me to go with me.

  The Christ talked to us all in our respective tongues. You can see
  this man in your sleep any time you want after you have seen him
  and shaken hands with him once. Through him you can go to heaven
  and meet your friends. Since my return I have seen him often in my
  sleep. About the time the soldiers went up the Rosebud I was lying
  in my lodge asleep, when this man appeared and told me that the
  Indians had gotten into trouble, and I was frightened. The next
  night he appeared to me and told me that everything would come out
  all right.


                    THE GHOST DANCE AMONG THE SIOUX

The following was written originally in the Teton Dakota dialect by
George Sword, an Ogalala Sioux Indian, formerly captain of the Indian
police at Pine Ridge agency and now judge of the Indian court. It
was translated by an Indian for Miss Emma C. Sickels and is published
by her courtesy. The copy of the original Sioux manuscript is in the
archives of the Bureau of Ethnology:

  In the story of ghost dancing, the Ogalala heard that the Son of
  God was truly on earth in the west from their country. This was in
  the year 1889. The first people knew about the messiah to be on
  earth were the Shoshoni and Arapaho. So in 1889 Good Thunder with
  four or five others visited the place where Son of God said to be.
  These people went there without permission. They said the messiah
  was there at the place, but he was there to help the Indians and
  not the whites; so this made the Indians happy to find out this.
  Good Thunder, Cloud Horse, Yellow Knife, and Short Bull visited the
  place again in 1890 and saw the messiah. Their story of visit to
  the messiah is as follows:

  “From the country where the Arapaho and Shoshoni we start in the
  direction of northwest in train for five nights and arrived at
  the foot of the Rocky mountains. Here we saw him and also several
  tribes of Indians. The people said that the messiah will come at
  a place in the woods where the place was prepare for him. When we
  went to the place a smoke descended from heaven to the place where
  he was to come. When the smoke disappeared, there was a man of
  about forty, which was the Son of God. The man said:”

  “‘My grandchildren! I am glad you have come far away to see your
  relatives. This are your people who have come back from your
  country.’ When he said he want us to go with him, we looked and
  we saw a land created across the ocean on which all the nations
  of Indians were coming home, but, as the messiah looked at the
  land which was created and reached across the ocean, again
  disappeared, saying that it was not time for that to take place.
  The messiah then gave to Good Thunder some paints—Indian paint
  and a white paint—a green grass [sagebrush twigs?]; and said, ‘My
  grandchildren, when you get home, go to farming and send all your
  children to school. And on way home if you kill any buffalo cut the
  head, the tail, and the four feet and leave them, and that buffalo
  will come to live again. When the soldiers of the white people
  chief want to arrest me, I shall stretch out my arms, which will
  knock them to nothingness, or, if not that, the earth will open and
  swallow them in. My father commanded me to visit the Indians on a
  purpose. I have came to the white people first, but they not good.
  They killed me, and you can see the marks of my wounds on my feet,
  my hands, and on my back. My father has given you life—your old
  life—and you have come to see your friends, but you will not take
  me home with you at this time. I want you to tell when you get home
  your people to follow my examples. Any one Indian does not obey me
  and tries to be on white’s side will be covered over by a new land
  that is to come over this old one. You will, all the people, use
  the paints and grass I give you. In the spring when the green grass
  comes, your people who have gone before you will come back, and you
  shall see your friends then, for you have come to my call.’”

  The people from every tipi send for us to visit them. They are
  people who died many years ago. Chasing Hawk, who died not long
  ago, was there, and we went to his tipi. He was living with his
  wife, who was killed in war long ago. They live in a buffalo skin
  tipi—a very large one—and he wanted all his friends to go there to
  live. A son of Good Thunder who died in war long ago was one who
  also took us to his tipi so his father saw him. When coming we come
  to a herd of buffaloes. We killed one and took everything except
  the four feet, head, and tail, and when we came a little ways from
  it there was the buffaloes come to life again and went off. This
  was one of the messiah’s word came to truth. The messiah said, “I
  will short your journey when you feel tired of the long ways, if
  you call upon me.” This we did when we were tired. The night came
  upon us, we stopped at a place, and we called upon the messiah to
  help us, because we were tired of long journey. We went to sleep
  and in the morning we found ourselves at a great distance from
  where we stopped.

  The people came back here and they got the people loyal to the
  government, and those not favor of the whites held a council. The
  agent’s soldiers were sent after them and brought Good Thunder and
  two others to the agency and they were confined to the prison. They
  were asked by the agent and Captain Sword whether they saw the
  Son of God and whether they hold councils over their return from
  visit, but Good Thunder refused to say “yes.” They were confined
  in the prison for two days, and upon their promising not to hold
  councils about their visit they were released. They went back to
  the people and told them about their trouble with the agent. Then
  they disperse without a council.

  In the following spring the people at Pine Ridge agency began to
  gather at the White Clay creek for councils. Just at this time
  Kicking Bear, from Cheyenne River agency, went on a visit to the
  Arapaho and said that the Arapaho there have ghost dancing. He said
  that people partaking in dance would get crazy and die, then the
  messiah is seen and all the ghosts. When they die they see strange
  things, they see their relatives who died long before. They saw
  these things when they died in ghost dance and came to life again.
  The person dancing becomes dizzy and finally drop dead, and the
  first thing they saw is an eagle comes to them and carried them to
  where the messiah is with his ghosts. The man said this:

  The persons in the ghost dancing are all joined hands. A man stands
  and then a woman, so in that way forming a very large circle. They
  dance around in the circle in a continuous time until some of them
  become so tired and overtired that they became crazy and finally
  drop as though dead, with foams in mouth all wet by perspiration.
  All the men and women made holy shirts and dresses they wear in
  dance. The persons dropped in dance would all lie in great dust the
  dancing make. They paint the white muslins they made holy shirts
  and dresses out of with blue across the back, and alongside of
  this is a line of yellow paint. They also paint in the front part
  of the shirts and dresses. A picture of an eagle is made on the
  back of all the shirts and dresses. On the shoulders and on the
  sleeves they tied eagle feathers. They said that the bullets will
  not go through these shirts and dresses, so they all have these
  dresses for war. Their enemies weapon will not go through these
  dresses. The ghost dancers all have to wear eagle feather on head.
  With this feather any man would be made crazy if fan with this
  feather. In the ghost dance no person is allow to wear anything
  made of any metal, except the guns made of metal is carry by some
  of the dancers. When they come from ghosts or after recovery from
  craziness, they brought meat from the ghosts or from the supposed
  messiah. They also brought water, fire, and wind with which to kill
  all the whites or Indians who will help the chief of the whites.
  They made sweat house and made holes in the middle of the sweat
  house where they say the water will come out of these holes. Before
  they begin to dance they all raise their hands toward the northwest
  and cry in supplication to the messiah and then begin the dance
  with the song, “_Ate misunkala ceya omani-ye_,” etc.


                    SELWYN’S INTERVIEW WITH KUWAPI

On November 21, 1890, it was reported to Agent E. W. Foster, in charge
of Yankton agency, South Dakota, that an Indian named Kuwapi, from
Rosebud agency, was on the reservation teaching the doctrine and
ceremony of the Ghost dance. He at once had the man arrested by a
force in charge of William T. Selwyn, a full-blood Yankton Sioux, who
had received a fair education under the patronage of a gentleman in
Philadelphia, and who had for several years been employed in various
capacities at different Sioux agencies. Selwyn had recently come from
Pine Ridge, where he had learned and reported to Agent Gallagher
something of the religious excitement among the western Sioux, and
had afterward repeated this information to the agent at Yankton. While
Kuwapi was in his custody Selwyn questioned him at length concerning
the new doctrine, and forwarded the following report (_G. D., Document
36861—1890_) of the interview to Agent Foster:

                               +Yankton Agency, South Dakota+,
                                                 _November 22, 1890_.

  Colonel +E. W. Foster+,
            _United States Indian Agent, Yankton Agency, South Dakota_.

  +Dear Sir+: It has been reported here a few days ago that there was
  an Indian visitor up at White Swan from Rosebud agency who has been
  telling or teaching the doctrines of the new messiah, and has made
  some agitation among the people up there. According to the request
  of Captain Conrad, United States Army, of Fort Randall, South
  Dakota, and by your order of the 21st instant, I went up to White
  Swan and have arrested the wanted man (Kuwapi, or One they chased
  after). On my way to the agency with the prisoner I have made
  little interview with him on the subject of the new messiah. The
  following are the facts which he corroborated concerning the new
  messiah, his laws and doctrines to the Indians of this continent:

  Q. Do you believe in the new messiah?—A. I somewhat believe it.

  Q. What made you believe it?—A. Because I ate some of the buffalo
  meat that he (the new messiah) sent to the Rosebud Indians through
  Short Bull.

  Q. Did Short Bull say that he saw the living herd of roaming
  buffaloes while he was with the son of the Great Spirit?—A. Short
  Bull told the Indians at Rosebud that the buffalo and other wild
  game will be restored to the Indians at the same time when the
  general resurrection in favor of the Indians takes place.

  Q. You said a “general resurrection in favor of the Indians takes
  place;” when or how soon will this be?—A. The father sends word to
  us that he will have all these caused to be so in the spring, when
  the grass is knee high.

  Q. You said “father;” who is this father?—A. It is the new messiah.
  He has ordered his children (Indians) to call him “father.”

  Q. You said the father is not going to send the buffalo until the
  resurrection takes place. Would he be able to send a few buffaloes
  over this way for a sort of a sample, so as to have his children
  (Indians) to have a taste of the meat?—A. The father wishes to do
  things all at once, even in destroying the white race.

  Q. You said something about the destroying of the white race.
  Do you mean to say that all mankind except the Indians will be
  killed?—A. Yes.

  Q. How, and who is going to kill the white people?—A. The father is
  going to cause a big cyclone or whirlwind, by which he will have
  all the white people to perish.

  Q. If it should be a cyclone or whirlwind, what are we going to
  do to protect ourselves?—A. The father will make some kind of
  provisions by which we will be saved.

  Q. You said something about the coming destruction on the white
  people by your father. Supposing your father is sick, tired out,
  forget, or some other accidental cause by which he should not be
  able to accomplish his purpose, what would be the case about the
  destroying of the white people?—A. There is no doubt about these
  things, as the miracle performer or the father is going to do just
  as what he said he would do.

  Q. What other object could you come to by which you are led to
  believe that there is such a new messiah on earth at present?—A.
  The ghost dancers are fainted whenever the dance goes on.

  Q. Do you believe that they are really fainted?—A. Yes.

  Q. What makes you believe that the dancers have really fainted?—A.
  Because when they wake or come back to their senses they sometimes
  bring back some news from the unknown world, and some little
  trinkets, such as buffalo tail, buffalo meat, etc.

  Q. What did the fainted ones see when they get fainted?—A. They
  visited the happy hunting ground, the camps, multitudes of people,
  and a great many strange people.

  Q. What did the ghost or the strange people tell the fainted one
  or ones?—A. When the fainted one goes to the camp, he is welcomed
  by the relatives of the visitor (the fainted one), and he is also
  invited to several feasts.

  Q. Were the people at Rosebud agency anxiously waiting or expecting
  to see all of their dead relatives who have died several years
  ago?—A. Yes.

  Q. We will have a great many older folks when all the dead people
  come back, would we not?—A. The visitors all say that there is not
  a single old man nor woman in the other world—all changed to young.

  Q. Are we going to die when the dead ones come back?—A. No; we will
  be just the same as we are today.

  Q. Did the visitor say that there is any white men in the other
  world?—A. No; no white people.

  Q. If there is no white people in the other world, where did they
  get their provisions and clothing?—A. In the other world, the
  messenger tells us that they have depended altogether for their
  food on the flesh of buffalo and other wild game; also, they were
  all clad in skins of wild animals.

  Q. Did the Rosebud agency Indians believe the new messiah, or the
  son of the Great Spirit?—A. Yes.

  Q. How do they show that they have a belief in the new messiah?—A.
  They show themselves by praying to the father by looking up to
  heaven, and call him “father,” just the same as you would in a
  church.

  Q. Have you ever been in a church?—A. No.

  Q. Do you faithfully believe in the new messiah?—A. I did not in
  the first place, but as I became more acquainted with the doctrines
  of the new messiah that I really believe in him.

  Q. How many people at Rosebud, in your opinion, believe this new
  messiah?—A. Nearly every one.

  Q. Did you not the Rosebud people prepare to attack the white
  people this summer? While I was at Pine Ridge agency this summer
  the Oglalla Sioux Indians say they will resist against the
  government if the latter should try to put a stop to the messiah
  question. Did your folks at Rosebud say the same thing?—A. Yes.

  Q. Are they still preparing and thinking to attack the white people
  should the government send our soldiers with orders to put a stop
  to your new business of the messiah?—A. I do not know, but I think
  that the Wojaji band at Rosebud agency will do some harm at any
  time.

  Q. You do not mean to say that the Rosebud Indians will try and
  cause an outbreak?—A. That seems to be the case.

  Q. You said something about the “son of the Great Spirit,” or “the
  father.” What do you mean by the son of the Great Spirit?—A. This
  father, as he is called, said himself that he is the son of the
  Great Spirit.

  Q. Have you talked to or with any Indian at White Swan about
  the new messiah, his laws and doctrines, or have you referred
  this to anyone while there?—A. I have told a few of them. I did
  not voluntarily express my wish for them to know and follow the
  doctrines of the new messiah.

  Q. Yes, but you have explained the matter to the Indians, did you
  not?—A. Yes, I have.

  Q. Do the Yankton Indians at White Swan believe in your teaching of
  the new messiah?—A. I did not intend to teach them, but as I have
  been questioned on the subject, that I have said something about it.

  Q. Did any of them believe in you?—A. Some have already believed
  it, and some of them did not believe it.

  Q. Those that have believed in you must be better men than the
  others, are they not?—A. I do not know.

  Q. Do you intend to introduce the doctrines of the new messiah from
  Rosebud to this agency as a missionary of the gospel?—A. No, I did
  not.

  Q. What brings you here, then?—A. I have some relatives here that I
  wanted to see, and this was the reason why I came here.

  Q. Where does this new messiah question originate? I mean from the
  first start of it.—A. This has originated in White mountains.

  Q. Where is this White mountain?—A. Close to the big Rocky
  mountains, near the country that belong to the Mexicans.

  Q. Do you think that there will be a trouble in the west by next
  spring?—A. Yes.

  Q. What makes you think so?—A. Because that is what I have heard
  people talk of.

  This is all that I have questioned Kuwapi on the subject of the new
  messiah.

      Respectfully, your obedient servant,
                                                 +William T. Selwyn+.




                             +Chapter XI+

                  THE GHOST DANCE WEST OF THE ROCKIES


The first Ghost dance on Walker Lake reservation took place in January,
1889, about a mile above the railroad bridge near the agency. Wovoka’s
preaching had already been attracting general attention among his own
people for some months. It is said that six Apache attended this first
dance, but the statement is improbable, as this would imply that they
had made a journey of 600 miles through a desert country to see a man
as yet unknown outside of his own tribe. From this time, however,
his fame went abroad, and another large dance in the same vicinity
soon after was attended by a number of Ute from Utah. The Ute are
neighbors of the Paiute on the east, as the Bannock are on the north,
and these tribes were naturally the first to hear of the new prophet
and to send delegates to attend the dance. The doctrine spread almost
simultaneously to all the scattered bands of Paiute in Nevada, Oregon,
and adjacent sections.

In its essential features the Ghost dance among the Paiute as conducted
by the messiah himself was practically the same as among the majority
of the prairie tribes, as will later be described. The Sioux, Kiowa,
and perhaps some other tribes, however, danced around a tree or pole
set up in the center of the ring, differing in this respect from the
Paiute, as well as from the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Caddo, and others. No
fire was allowed within the ring by any of the prairie tribes among
whom the subject was investigated, but among the Paiute it seems
that fires were built either within the circle or close to it. When
I visited the messiah in January, 1892, deep snow was on the ground,
which had caused the temporary suspension of dancing, so that I had no
opportunity of seeing the performance there for myself. I saw, however,
the place cleared for the dance ground—the same spot where the large
delegation from Oklahoma had attended the dance the preceding summer—at
the upper end of Mason valley. A large circular space had been cleared
of sagebrush and leveled over, and around the circumference were the
remains of the low round structures of willow branches which had
sheltered those in attendance. At one side, within the circle, was a
larger structure of branches, where the messiah gave audience to the
delegates from distant tribes, and, according to their statements,
showed them the glories of the spirit world through the medium of
hypnotic trances. The Paiute always dance five nights, or perhaps more
properly four nights and the morning of the fifth day, as enjoined,
by the messiah on the visiting delegates, ending the performance with
a general shaking and waving of blankets, as among the prairie tribes,
after which all go down and bathe in the nearest stream. The shaking
of the blankets dispels all evil influences and drives sickness and
disease away from the dancers. There is no previous consecration of the
ground, as among the Arapaho, and no preliminary sweat bath, as among
the Sioux. The sweat bath seems to be unknown to the Paiute, who are
preeminently a dirty people, and I saw no trace of sweat-house frames
at any of their camps. Nakash, the Arapaho who visited the messiah in
1889 and first brought the dance to the eastern tribes, confirmed the
statements of the Paiute and ranchmen that there were no trances in the
Paiute Ghost dance.

Besides the dance ground in Mason valley, where the messiah himself
generally presided, there were several others on Walker River
reservation, although, if we are to believe the agent, no Ghost dances
were ever held on either reservation.

The following extract from Porcupine’s account of his visit to the
messiah in the fall of 1889 (see page 793) gives some idea of the
Paiute Ghost dance and throws light on the cataleptic peculiarities of
the messiah:

  I went to the agency at Walker lake, and they told us Christ would
  be there in two days. At the end of two days, on the third morning,
  hundreds of people gathered at this place. They cleared off a place
  near the agency in the form of a circus ring and we all gathered
  there. This space was perfectly cleared of grass, etc. We waited
  there till late in the evening, anxious to see Christ. Just before
  sundown I saw a great many people, mostly Indians, coming dressed
  in white men’s clothes. The Christ was with them. They all formed
  in this ring in a circle around him. They put up sheets all around
  the circle, as they had no tents. Just after dark some of the
  Indians told me that the Christ (father) was arrived. I looked
  around to find him, and finally saw him sitting on one side of the
  ring. They all started toward him to see him. They made a big fire
  to throw light on him. I never looked around, but went forward,
  and when I saw him I bent my head.... He sat there a long time and
  nobody went up to speak to him. He sat with his head bowed all the
  time. After awhile he rose and said he was very glad to see his
  children. “I have sent for you and am glad to see you. I am going
  to talk to you after awhile about your relatives who are dead and
  gone. My children, I want you to listen to all I have to say to
  you. I will teach you, too, how to dance a dance, and I want you to
  dance it. Get ready for your dance, and then when the dance is over
  I will talk to you.” He was dressed in a white coat with stripes.
  The rest of his dress was a white man’s, except that he had on a
  pair of moccasins. Then he commenced our dance, everybody joining
  in, the Christ singing while we danced. We danced till late in the
  night; then he told us we had danced enough.

  The next morning after breakfast was over, we went into the circle
  and spread canvas over it on the ground, the Christ standing in
  the midst of us. He told us he was going away that day, but would
  be back the next morning and talk to us.... He had no beard or
  whiskers, but very heavy eyebrows. He was a good-looking man. We
  were crowded up very close. We had been told that nobody was to
  talk, and that even if we whispered the Christ would know it.... He
  would talk to us all day.

  That evening we all assembled again to see him depart. When we were
  assembled he began to sing, and he commenced to tremble all over
  violently for a while and then sat down. We danced all that night,
  the Christ lying down beside us apparently dead.

  The next morning when we went to eat breakfast, the Christ was with
  us. After breakfast four heralds went around and called out that
  the Christ was back with us and wanted to talk with us. The circle
  was prepared again. The people assembled, and Christ came among us
  and sat down. (_G. D., 9._)

We come now to the other tribes bordering on the Paiute. First in order
are the Washo, a small band dwelling on the slopes of the sierras in
the neighborhood of Carson, Nevada, and speaking a peculiar language
of unknown affinity. They are completely under the domination of the
Paiute. They had no separate dance, but joined in with the nearest
camps of Paiute and sang the same songs. Occupying practically the same
territory as the Paiute, they were among the first to receive the new
doctrine.

Farther to the south, in California, about Bridgeport and Mono lake
and extending across to the westward slope of the sierras, are several
small Shoshonean bands closely akin to the Paiute and known locally as
the “Diggers.” The Paiute state that bands of these Indians frequently
came up and participated in the dance on the reservation. They
undoubtedly had their own dances at home also.

According to the statement of the agent in charge of the Mission
Indians in southern California in 1891, the doctrine reached them also,
and the medicine-men of Potrero began to prophesy the destruction of
the whites and the return of Indian supremacy. Few believed their
predictions, however, until rumors brought the news of the overflow of
Colorado river and the birth of “Salton sea” in the summer of 1891.
Never doubting that the great change was near at hand, the frightened
Indians fled to the mountains to await developments, but after having
gone hungry for several days the millennial dawn seemed still as far
away as ever, and they returned to their homes with disappointment in
their hearts. Although the agent mentions specifically only the Indians
of Potrero, there can be no doubt that the inhabitants of the other
Mission rancherias in the vicinity were also affected, and we are thus
enabled to fix the boundary of the messiah excitement in this direction
at the Pacific ocean. (_Comr., 27._)

In northern California the new doctrine was taken up late in 1890
by the Pit River Indians, a group of tribes constituting a distinct
linguistic stock and scattered throughout the whole basin of Pit river,
from Goose lake to the Sacramento, which may have formed the boundary
of the Ghost-dance movement in this direction. (_A. G. O., 7._) As a
number of these Indians are living also on Round Valley reservation in
California, it is possible that the doctrine may have reached there
also. Having obtained the dance ritual directly from the Paiute, their
neighbors on the east, the ceremony and belief were probably the same
with both tribes.

So far as can be learned from the reports of agents, and from the
statement of Wovoka himself, the dance was never taken up by the
Indians of Hoopa Valley reservation in California; of Klamath, Siletz,
Grande Ronde, or Umatilla reservations in Oregon; by any of the tribes
in Washington; by those of Lapwai or Cœur d’Alêne reservations in
Idaho; or on Jocko reservation in Montana. Wovoka stated that he had
been visited by delegates from Warmspring agency, in Oregon, who also
had taken part in the dance, but these may have been some of the Paiute
living on that reservation. The small band of Paiute living with the
Klamath probably also attended the dance at some time.[8]

A single Nez Percé visited the messiah, but the visit had no effect
on his tribe at home. In a general way it may be stated that the
doctrine of the Ghost dance was never taken up by any tribes of the
Salishan or Shahaptian stocks, occupying practically the whole of the
great Columbia basin. This is probably due to the fact that the more
important of these tribes have been for a long time under the influence
of Catholic or other Christian missionaries, while most of the others
are adherents of the Smohalla or the Shaker doctrine.

Of the tribes southward from the Paiute, according to the best
information obtainable, the Ghost dance never reached the Yuma, Pima,
Papago, Maricopa, or any of the Apache bands in Arizona or New Mexico,
neither did it affect any of the Pueblo tribes except the Taos, who
performed the dance merely as a pastime. As before stated, it is said
that six Apache attended the first large dance at Walker lake in 1889.
This seems improbable, but if true it produced no effect on any part
of the tribe at large. Later on the Jicarilla Apache, in northern New
Mexico, may have heard of it through the southern Ute, but, so far as
is known officially, neither of these tribes ever engaged in the dance.
The agent of the Jicarilla states that the tribe knew nothing of the
doctrine until informed of it by himself. (_G. D., 10._) It seems never
to have been taken up by the Mescalero Apache in southern New Mexico,
although they are in the habit of making frequent visits to the Kiowa,
Comanche, Apache, and other Ghost-dancing tribes of Oklahoma. The agent
of the Mohave states officially that these Indians knew nothing about
it, but this must be a mistake, as there is constant communication
between the Mohave and the southern Paiute, and, according to Wovoka’s
statement, Mohave delegates attended the dance in 1890, while the 700
Walapai and Chemehuevi associated with the Mohave are known to have
been devoted adherents of the doctrine.

The dance was taken up nearly simultaneously by the Bannock, Shoshoni,
Gosiute, and Ute in the early part of 1889. All these tribes are
neighbors (on the east) of the Paiute and closely cognate to them,
the Bannock particularly having only a slight dialectal difference of
language, so that communication between them is an easy matter. The

Bannock are chiefly on Fort Hall and Lemhi reservations in Idaho.
The Shoshoni are on the Western Shoshone (Duck Valley) reservation
in Nevada, on Fort Hall and Lemhi reservations in Idaho, and on Wind
River reservation in Wyoming. The Ute are on Uintah and Uncompahgre
reservations in Utah, and on the Southern Ute reservation in Colorado.
There are also a considerable number of Bannock and Shoshoni not on
reservations. The Ute of Utah sent delegates to the messiah soon after
the first Ghost dance in January, 1889, but it is doubtful if the
southern Ute in Colorado were engaged in the dance. Although aware of
the doctrine, they ridiculed the idea of the dead returning to earth.
(_G. D., 11._)

In regard to the dance among the Shoshoni and Paiute on the Western
Shoshoni reservation, in Nevada and Idaho, their agent writes, under
date of November 8, 1890:

  The Indians of this reservation and vicinity have just concluded
  their second medicine dance, the previous one having taken place
  in August last. They are looking for the coming of the Indian
  Christ, the resurrection of the dead Indians, and the consequent
  supremacy of the Indian race. Fully one thousand people took part
  in the dance. While the best of order prevailed, the excitement was
  very great as morning approached. When the dancers were worn out
  mentally and physically, the medicine-men would shout that they
  could see the faces of departed friends and relatives moving about
  the circle. No pen can paint the picture of wild excitement that
  ensued. All shouted in a chorus, Christ has come, and then danced
  and sung until they fell in a confused and exhausted mass on the
  ground.... I apprehend no trouble beyond the loss of time and the
  general demoralizing effect of these large gatherings of people.
  Several of the leading men have gone to Walker lake to confer with
  a man who calls himself Christ. Others have gone to Fort Hall to
  meet Indians from Montana and Dakota, to get the news from that
  section. In fact, the astonishing part of the business is the fact
  that all the Indians in the country seem to possess practically the
  same ideas and expect about the same result. (_G. D., 12._)

On December 6 he writes that another Ghost dance had then been in
progress for six days, and that the Indians had announced their
intention to dance one week in each month until the grass grew, at
which time the medicine-men had told them the messiah would come,
bringing with him all their dead friends. (_G. D., 13._) This dance,
however, was attended by a much smaller number of Indians, and skeptics
had already arisen among them to scoff at the new believers. The leaven
was working, and only a little shrewd diplomacy was needed to turn the
religious scale, as is shown by an extract from a third letter, dated
January 10, 1891, from which it would seem that Agent Plumb is a man of
practical common sense, as likewise that Esau was not the only one who
would sell his birthright for a mess of pottage:

  Christmas day was the day set for commencing another dance. On
  learning this, I told the Indians that it was my intention to give
  them all a big feast and have a general holiday on Christmas, but
  that I would not give them anything if they intended to dance. I
  told them they could play all of their usual games, in fact, have
  a good time, but that dancing was forbidden. I showed them how
  continued dancing at various Sioux agencies had ended in soldiers
  being sent to stop them. I stated the case as clearly as I could;
  the Indians debated it two days, and then reported that while they
  hoped their dead friends would come back, and believed that dancing
  would help to bring them, yet they were friends of the government,
  and friends of the whites, and my friends, and would not hold any
  more resurrection dances without my consent. Up to this date they
  have kept their word. I have no hope of breaking up their dances
  altogether, but I have strong hopes of controlling them. (_G. D.,
  14._)

The Bannock and Shoshoni of Fort Hall reservation in Idaho have served
as the chief medium of the doctrine between the tribes west of the
mountains and those of the plains. Situated almost on the summit of the
great divide, they are within easy reach of the Paiute to the west,
among whom the dance originated, and whose language the Bannock speak,
while at no great distance to the east, on Wind River reservation in
Wyoming, the remaining Shoshoni are confederated with the Arapaho,
who have been from the first the great apostles of the doctrine among
the prairie tribes. There is constant visiting back and forth between
the tribes of these two reservations, while the four railroads coming
in at Fort Hall, together with the fact of its close proximity to the
main line of the Union Pacific, tend still more to make it a focus
and halting point for Indian travel. Almost every delegation from the
tribes east of the mountains stopped at this agency to obtain the
latest news from the messiah and to procure interpreters from among
the Bannock to accompany them to Nevada. In a letter of November 26,
1890, to the Indian Commissioner, the agent in charge states that
during the preceding spring and summer his Indians had been visited
by representatives from about a dozen different reservations. In
regard to the dance and the doctrine at Fort Hall, he also says that
the extermination and resurrection business was not a new thing with
his tribes by any means, but had been quite a craze with them every
few years for the last twenty years or more, only varying a little
according to the whim of particular medicine-men. (_G. D., 15._) This
may have referred to the doctrine already mentioned as having been
taught by Tävibo.

Early in 1889 a Bannock from Fort Hall visited the Shoshoni and Arapaho
of Wind River reservation in Wyoming and brought them the first
knowledge of the new religion. He had just returned from a visit to
the Paiute country, where he said he had met messengers who had told
him that the dead people were coming back, and who had commanded him
to go and tell all the tribes. “And so,” said the Shoshoni, “he came
here and told us all about it.” Accordingly, in the summer of that
year a delegation of five Shoshoni, headed by Täbinshi, with Nakash
(“Sage”), an Arapaho, visited the messiah of Mason valley, traveling
most of the way by railroad and occupying several days in the journey.
They attended a Ghost dance, which, according to their accounts, was a
very large one, and after dancing all night were told by the messiah
that they would meet all their dead in two years from that time at the
turning of the leaves, i. e., in the autumn of 1891. They were urged
to dance frequently, “because the dance moves the dead.” One of the
Shoshoni delegates understood the Bannock and Paiute language and
interpreted for the rest. The information was probably conveyed by the
Shoshoni to the Arapaho through the medium of the sign language.

In accord with the report of the delegates, on their return home the
Shoshoni and Arapaho at once began to dance. A year later, in the fall
of 1890, a dense smoke from forest fires in the mountains drifted
down and obscured the air in the lower country to such an extent that
horses were lost in the haze. This was regarded by the Indians as an
indication of the approach of the great change, and the dance was
continued with increased fervor, but at last the atmosphere began to
clear and the phenomenon ended as it had begun—in smoke. The dance
was kept up, however, without abatement for another year, until the
predicted time had come and gone, when the Shoshoni—who seem to share
the skeptical nature of their southern kinsmen, the Comanche—concluded
that they had been deceived, and abandoned the dance. The Arapaho, who
have greater faith in the unseen things of the spirit world, kept it
up, and were still dancing when I visited them in the summer of 1892. A
part of the Arapaho, headed by their chief, Black Coal, and encouraged
by the Catholic missionaries, had steadily opposed the dance from the
first. After considerable discussion of the matter it was decided, on
Black Coal’s proposition, to send another delegation to the messiah,
under the guidance of Yellow Eagle, a graduate of a government Indian
school, to learn as to the truth or falsity of the new doctrine. They
returned early in 1891 and reported against the movement. Their report
confirmed the doubters in their skepticism, but produced little effect
on the rest of the tribe.

When I visited Wind River reservation in Wyoming in June, 1892, the
agent in charge informed me that there was no Ghost dancing on his
reservation; that he had explained how foolish it was and had strictly
forbidden it, and that in consequence the Indians had abandoned
it. However, he expressed interest in my investigation, and as the
Arapaho, with whom I had most to do, were then camped in a body a
few miles up in the mountains cutting wood, he very kindly furnished
a conveyance and camping outfit, with two of the agency employees—a
clerk and an interpreter—to take me out. It appeared afterward that the
escort had received instructions of their own before starting. Having
reached the camp and set up our tent, the Arapaho soon came around to
get acquainted, over a pipe and a cup of coffee; but, in answer to
questions put by one of my companions, a white man, who assumed the
burden of the conversation, it seemed that the Indians had lost all
interest in the dance. In fact, some of them were so ignorant on the
subject that they wanted to know what it meant.

After trying in vain to convince me that it was useless to waste time
further with the Indians, the clerk started back again after supper,
satisfied that that part of the country was safe so far as the Ghost
dance was concerned. By this time it was dark, and the Indians invited
the interpreter and myself to come over to a tipi about half a mile
away, where we could meet all the old men. We started, and had gone but
a short distance when we heard from a neighboring hill the familiar
measured cadence of the ghost songs. On turning with a questioning
look to my interpreter—who was himself a half-blood—he quietly said:
“Yes; they are dancing the Ghost dance. That’s something I have never
reported, and I never will. It is their religion and they have a right
to it.” Not wishing to be an accomplice in crime, I did not go over to
the dance; but it is needless to state that the old men in the tipi
that night, and for several successive nights thereafter, knew all
about the songs and ceremonies of the new religion. As already stated,
the Shoshoni had really lost faith and abandoned the dance.

Among the Shoshoni the dance was performed around a small cedar
tree, planted in the ground for that purpose. Unlike the Sioux, they
hung nothing on this tree. The men did not clasp each other’s hands,
but held on to their blankets instead; but a woman standing between
two men took hold of their hands. There was no preliminary medicine
ceremony. The dance took place usually in the morning, and at its close
the performers shook their blankets in the air, as among the Paiute
and other tribes, before dispersing. However novel may have been the
doctrine, the Shoshoni claim that the Ghost dance itself as performed
by them was a revival of an old dance which they had had fully fifty
years before.

The selection of the cedar in this connection is in agreement with the
general Indian idea, which has always ascribed a mystic sacredness to
that tree, from its never-dying green, which renders it so conspicuous
a feature of the desert landscape; from the aromatic fragrance of its
twigs, which are burned as incense in sacred ceremonies; from the
durability and fine texture of its wood, which makes it peculiarly
appropriate for tipi poles and lance shafts; and from the dark-red
color of its heart, which seems as though dyed in blood. In Cherokee
myth the cedar was originally a pole, to the top of which they fastened
the fresh scalps of their enemies, and the wood was thus stained by the
blood that trickled slowly down along it to the ground. The Kiowa also
selected a cedar for the center of their Ghost-dance circle.

We go back now to the southern tribes west of the mountains. Some time
in the winter of 1889–90 Paiute runners brought to the powerful tribe
of the Navaho, living in northern New Mexico and Arizona, the news of
the near advent of the messiah and the resurrection of the dead. They
preached and prophesied for a considerable time, but the Navaho were
skeptical, laughed at the prophets, and paid but little attention to
the prophesies. (_Matthews, 1._) According to the official report for
1892, these Indians, numbering somewhat over 16,000 souls, have, in
round numbers, 9,000 cattle, 119,000 horses, and 1,600,000 sheep and
goats; and, as suggested by Dr Matthews, the authority on that tribe,
it may be that, being rich in herds and wealth of silver, they felt
no special need of a redeemer. While with the Navaho in the winter
of 1892–93 I made inquiry in various parts of their wide-extended
territory, but could not learn that the Ghost dance had ever been
performed among them, and it evident that in their case the doctrinal
seed had fallen on barren ground.

[Illustration: +Fig. 70+—Navaho Indians.]

Before visiting the tribe, I had written for information to Mr A. M.
Stephen, of Keams Cañon, Arizona, since deceased, who had studied the
Navaho and Hopi for years and spoke the Navaho language fluently. I
quote from him on the subject. It may be noted that Keams Cañon is
about 125 miles northwest of Fort Wingate, the point from which Dr
Matthews writes, and nearer by that much to the Paiute, Cohonino, and
Walapai, all of whom have accepted the new religion. Mr Stephen states
that some time in February or March, 1890, he first heard rumors among
the Navaho that “the old men long dead” had returned to some foreign
tribes in the north or east, the vague far away. The intelligence was
brought to the Navaho either by the Ute or Paiute, or both. The rumor
grew and the idea became commonly current among the Navaho that the
mythic heroes were to return and that under their direction they were
to expel American and Mexican and restrict the Zuñi and Hopi close to
their villages, and, in fact, to reestablish their old domain from San
Francisco mountains to Santa Fé. (_Stephen, 1._) On November 22, 1891,
he further writes:

  While out this last time I camped over night with some Navajo
  friends, and over a pipe brought up the messiah topic. This family
  belongs to the Bitter-Water gens, and this is the gist of what I
  got from them: A Pah-ute came to a family of their gens living
  near Navajo mountain and told them that _Na′-Keh-tkla-ĭ_ was to
  return from the under world and bring back all the Tinneh (Navajo)
  he had killed. _Na′-keh-tkla-ĭ_ (i. e., “foreigner with white foot
  sole”) in the long ago had a puma and a bear. These were his pets.
  He would call puma from the east and bear from the west, and just
  before dawn they met in the center. Thus they met four times. On
  the fourth meeting puma reached back with his forepaw and plucked
  his mane, tossing the hair aloft, and for every hair a Tinneh died.
  This fatal sorcery continued for a long time, and great numbers
  were killed. Now, the Pah-ute said, this sorcerer was to return,
  and would call his pets, and they would come east and west, and
  following their trail would be all the people whose death they
  had caused. These Navajo said they had heard of other Pah-ute
  prophecies a year or more ago, all to the effect that long dead
  people were to return alive from the under world. These resurrected
  ones were also to bring back the departed game, and the Tinneh
  would again dominate the region. But, said my informant, _datsaigi
  yelti_, “it is worthless talk.” (_Stephen, 2._)

In connection with hypnotism as seen in the Ghost dance, Dr Matthews
states that in one curious Navaho ceremony he has several times seen
the patient hypnotized or pretend to be hypnotized by a character
dressed in evergreens. The occurrence of the hypnotic trance is
regarded as a sign that the ceremony has been effective. If the trance
does not occur, some other ceremony must be tried. (_Matthews, 2._)

West of the Navaho in northeastern Arizona live the Hopi, or Moki,
a Pueblo tribe occupying several villages on the tops of nearly
inaccessible mesas. In July, 1891, four of these Indians, while on
a visit to the Cohonino, living farther to the west, first heard of
the new doctrine and witnessed a Ghost dance, as will be described
hereafter. They brought back the news to their people, but it made
no impression on them and the matter was soon forgotten. (_Stephen,
3._) In this connection Mr Stephen states, in response to a letter of
inquiry, that although he does not recollect any Hopi myth concerning
rejuvenation of the world and reunion with the resurrected dead on
this earth, yet the doctrine of a reunion with the revivified dead in
the under world is a commonly accepted belief of the Hopi. They have
also a curious myth of a fair-hair god and a fair-skin people who
came up from the under world with the Hopi, and who then left them
with a promise to return. This suggests the idea of a messiah, but Mr
Stephen has not yet been able to get the myth in its entirety. He does
not think it derived from any corrupt source, however, through Spanish
or other missionaries, as the allusions are all of archaic tendency.
(_Stephen, 4._)

[Illustration: +Fig. 71+—Vista in the Hopi pueblo of Walpi.]

The Cohonino or Havasupai are a small tribe occupying the canyon of
Cataract creek, an affluent of the Colorado, in northern Arizona,
about 120 miles west of the Hopi, with whom they have a considerable
trade in buckskins and mesquite bread. They probably obtained the
doctrine and the dance directly from the Paiute to the northward.
Our only knowledge of the Cohonino dance is derived through Hopi
informants, and as the two tribes speak languages radically different
the ideas conveyed were neither complete nor definite, but it is
evident that the general doctrine was the same, although the dance
differed in some respects from that of the other tribes.

We quote again from Stephen’s letter of November 22, 1891:

  During a quiet interval, in one of the kivas I found the Hopi who
  brought the tidings of the resurrection to his people. His name
  is Pütci and his story is very meager and confused. He went on a
  customary trading visit to the Cojonino in their home at Cataract
  creek, and I could not determine just when. The chief of the
  Cojonino is named Navajo, and when Pütci got there, Navajo had but
  lately returned from a visit to the westward. He had been with
  the Walapai, the Mohave, and perhaps still farther west, and had
  been gone nearly three months. He told his people a vague mystic
  story that he had heard during his travels, to the effect that the
  long-time dead people of the Antelope, Deer, and Rabbit [Antelope,
  Deer, etc., are probably Cohonino gentes—J. M.] were to come
  back and live in their former haunts; that they had reached to a
  place where were the people of the Puma, the Wolf, and the Bear;
  that this meeting delayed the coming, but eventually all these
  people would appear, and in the sequence here related. Pütci was
  accompanied by three other Hopi, and they said they did not very
  well understand this strange story. While they were stopping in
  Cataract cañon a one-night dance was held by the Cojonino, at which
  these Hopi were present. During the night a long pole, having the
  tail of an eagle fastened to the end, was brought out and securely
  planted in the ground, and the dancers were told by their shamans
  that anyone who could climb this pole and put his mouth on the tail
  would see his dead mother (maternal ancestor). One man succeeded
  in climbing it and laid his mouth on the feathers, and then fell
  to the bottom in a state of collapse. They deemed him dead, but
  before dawn he recovered and then said that he had seen his dead
  mother and several other dead ancestors, who told him they were
  all on their way back. The Hopi on their return home related these
  marvels, but apparently it made little impression, and it was only
  with difficulty I could gather the above meager details.

Through the kindness of Mr Thomas V. Keam, trader for the Hopi and
Navaho, we get a revision of Pütci’s story. Pütci states that in July,
1891, he with three other Hopi went on a visit to the Cohonino to
trade for buckskins. When they arrived in the vicinity of the Cohonino
camp, they were met by one of the tribe, who informed the visitors
that all the Indians were engaged in a very important ceremony, and
that before they could enter the camp they must wash their bodies and
paint them with white clay. Accordingly, when this had been done,
they were escorted to the camp and introduced to the principal chief
and headmen, all of whom they found engaged in washing their heads,
decorating themselves, and preparing for the ceremony, which took place
on a clear space near the camp late in the afternoon. Here a very tall
straight pole had been securely fastened upright in the ground. At the
top were tied two eagle-tail feathers. A circle was formed around this
pole by the Indians, and, after dancing around it until almost dark,
one of the men climbed the pole to the top, and remained there until
exhausted, when he would slide to the ground, clinging insensible to
the pole. After remaining in this state for some time, the medicine-men
resuscitated him. On recovery he stood up and told them he had been
into another world, where he saw all the old men who had died long ago,
and among them his own people. They told him they would all come back
in time and bring the deer, the antelope, and all other good things
they had when they dwelt on this earth. This ceremony lasted four days,
including the cleansing and decorating of the dancers and the climbing
of the pole, with an account of what had been seen by the Indian during
the time he was in an apparently lifeless state. Each day the ceremony
was attended by the whole tribe. (_Keam, 1._) Resuscitation by the
medicine-men, as here mentioned, is something unknown among the prairie
tribes, where the unconscious subject is allowed to lie undisturbed on
the ground until the senses return in the natural way.

Beyond the Cohonino, and extending for about 200 miles along Colorado
river on the Arizona side, are the associated tribes of Mohave,
Walapai, and Chemehuevi, numbering in all about 2,800 souls, of whom
only about one-third are on a reservation. The Chemehuevi, being
a branch of the Paiute and in constant communication with them,
undoubtedly had the dance and the doctrine. The Mohave also have much
to do with the Paiute, the two tribes interchanging visits and mutually
borrowing songs and games. They sent delegates to the messiah and
in all probability took up the Ghost dance, in spite of the agent’s
statement to the contrary. As only 660 of more than 2,000 Mohave are
reported as being on the reservation, the agent may have a good reason
for not keeping fully informed in regard to them.

Concerning the Walapai we have positive information. In September,
1890, the commanding officer at Fort Whipple was informed that a Paiute
from southern Utah was among the Walapai, inciting them to dance for
the purpose of causing hurricanes and storms to destroy the whites and
such Indians as would not participate in the dances. It was stated also
that these dances had then been going on for several months and were
participated in by a large portion of the tribe, and that each dance
lasted four or five nights in succession. On investigation it appeared
that this Paiute was one of a party who had come down and inaugurated
the Ghost dance among the Walapai the preceding year. (_G. D., 17._)

We find an account of the Walapai Ghost dance in a local paper a year
later. The article states that all the songs were in the language of
the Paiute, from whom the doctrine had originally come. The Walapai
version of the doctrine has been already noted. The dance itself, and
the step, as here described, are essentially the same as among other
tribes. Each dance lasted five nights, and on the last night was kept
up until daylight. Just before daylight on the morning of the last
night the medicine men ascended a small butte, where they met and
talked with the expected god, and on coming down again delivered his
message to the people. The dance was held at irregular intervals,
according to the instructions received on the butte by the medicine-men.

The dance place was a circular piece of ground a hundred feet in
diameter, inclosed by a fence of poles and bushes, and surrounded by
high mountain walls of granite, which reflected the light from half a
dozen fires blazing within the circle. The dancers, to the number of
200, clad in white robes with fancy trimmings, their faces and hair
painted white in various decorative designs, moved slowly around in
a circle, keeping time with a wild chant, while 200 more stood or
crouched around the fires, awaiting their turn to participate. The
dancers faced toward the center, each holding the hands of the ones
next to him and joining in the chant in unison. The dust issued in
clouds from beneath their feet, and with the dust and exertion together
the performers were soon exhausted and dropped out, when others took
their places. After each circuit they rested a few minutes and then
started round again. At each circuit a different chant was sung, and
thus the dance continued until midnight, when, with a loud clapping
of hands, it ended, and the people separated and went to their homes.
Throughout the performance two or three chiefs or medicine-men were
constantly going about on the outside of the circle to preserve order
and reprimand any merriment, one of them explaining to the visitors
that, as this was a religious ceremony, due solemnity must be observed.
(_J. F. L., 2._)




                             +Chapter XII+

          THE GHOST DANCE EAST OF THE ROCKIES—AMONG THE SIOUX

  In 1889 the Ogalala heard that the son of God had come upon earth
  in the west. They said the Messiah was there, but he had come to
  help the Indians and not the whites, and it made the Indians happy
  to hear this.—_George Sword._

  They signed away a valuable portion of their reservation, and it
  is now occupied by white people, for which they have received
  nothing. They understood that ample provision would be made for
  their support; instead, their supplies have been reduced and much
  of the time they have been living on half and two-thirds rations.
  Their crops, as well as the crops of white people, for two years
  have been almost a total failure. The disaffection is widespread,
  especially among the Sioux, while the Cheyennes have been on the
  verge of starvation and were forced to commit depredations to
  sustain life. These facts are beyond question, and the evidence is
  positive and sustained by thousands of witnesses.—_General Miles._


Among the tribes east of the mountains and north of Oklahoma, it
appears from official documents in the Indian Office and from other
obtainable information that the Ghost dance and the doctrine, if known
at all, were never accepted by the Blackfeet of Montana; the Ojibwa of
Turtle mountain and Devils lake in North Dakota, or by the rest of the
tribe farther to the east in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan; the
Omaha, Winnebago, and Ponka in Nebraska; the small band of Sauk and
Fox in Iowa; the still smaller band of Sauk and Fox, the Potawatomi,
Kickapoo, Iowa, and Ojibwa in northeastern Kansas; or by the Sioux
of Devils lake in North Dakota, Lake Traverse (Sisseton agency) and
Flandreau in South Dakota, and Santee agency in Nebraska. All or most
of these Sioux belong to the Santee or eastern division of the tribe,
and have long been under civilizing influences. According to official
statements the dance was not taken up by any of the Sioux of Crow Creek
or Yankton agencies in South Dakota, but they were certainly more or
less affected by it, as they knew all about it and are in constant
communication with the wilder bands of Sioux which were concerned in
the outbreak. I was informed by the Omaha and Winnebago in 1891 that
they had been told of the new messiah by visiting Sioux from Pine
Ridge agency in April, 1890, and later on by other Sioux from Yankton
agency, but had put no faith in the story, and had never organized a
Ghost dance. According to the agent in charge, the Crow of Montana
were not affected. This, if true, is remarkable, in view of the fact
that the Crow are a large tribe and comparatively primitive, and have
living near them the wildest of the Ghost-dancing tribes, the northern
Cheyenne especially occupying practically the same reservation. It is
possible that their experience in the Sword-bearer affair in 1887,
already mentioned, had a tendency to weaken their faith in later
prophets. Dr George Bird Grinnell, a competent authority, states, in
reply to a personal letter, that nothing was known about the dance by
the Blackfeet of Montana or by the Blackfeet, Sarsi, or Plains Cree on
the Canadian side of the boundary line.

Within the same general region, east of the Rocky mountains and north
of Oklahoma, the doctrine and the dance were accepted by the Asiniboin
(Fort Belknap and Fort Peck agencies), Grosventres (Arapaho subtribe,
Fort Belknap agency), northern Cheyenne of Montana; the Arikara,
Grosventres (Minitari), and Mandan of Fort Berthold agency, North
Dakota; the Shoshoni and northern Arapaho on Wind River reservation in
Wyoming, as already mentioned; and by the great body of the Sioux, at
Fort Peck agency (Yanktonais), Montana, and at Standing Rock, Cheyenne
River, Lower Brulé, Pine Ridge, and Rosebud agencies in North Dakota
and South Dakota. The whole number of Sioux concerned was about 20,000,
of whom 16,000 belonged to the Teton division, among the wildest
and most warlike of all the western tribes. A few Cheyenne are also
associated with the Sioux at Pine Ridge.

The northern Arapaho and the Shoshoni of Wyoming were the medium by
which the doctrine of the new messiah was originally communicated to
all these tribes. In the spring of 1889, Nakash, “Sage,” the Arapaho
chief already mentioned, crossed the mountains to investigate the
reports of the new religion, and brought back a full confirmation of
all that had been told them from the west. A visiting Grosventre, then
among the Arapaho, heard the story and brought back the wonderful news
to the Grosventres and Asiniboin of Fort Belknap, but although his
account was received by some with unquestioning faith, the excitement
had in it nothing of a dangerous character. (_G. D., 18._)

In a short time the news spread to the Cheyenne in Montana and the
Sioux of the Dakotas, and in the fall of 1889 delegates from these two
tribes arrived at Fort Washakie to learn more about the messiah in the
west. The principal Cheyenne delegate was Porcupine, while Short Bull
and Kicking Bear were the leaders of the Sioux party. After hearing the
statements of the Arapaho and Shoshoni, it was decided that some of the
Cheyenne should return and report to their tribe, while Porcupine and
one or two others, with the Sioux delegates, several Shoshoni, and the
Arapaho, Sitting Bull, and Friday, should go to Nevada, interview the
messiah himself, and learn the whole truth of the matter. Accordingly,
about November, 1889, Porcupine and his companions left Fort Washakie
in Wyoming for Fort Hall reservation in Idaho, where they met the
Shoshoni and Bannock and were well received and entertained by them.
The tribes at this place were firm believers in the new doctrine, and
Porcupine states that from there on to the end of the journey all the
Indians they met were dancing the Ghost dance. After stopping a few
days at Fort Hall, they went on again, accompanied by several Bannock
and Shoshoni, and going rapidly by railroad soon found themselves in
the country of the Paiute, and after stopping at one or two camps
arrived at the agency at Pyramid lake. Here the Paiute furnished them
conveyances and guides to the other agency farther south at Walker
river. Porcupine is our principal authority for the events of the trip,
and although he claims that he undertook this journey of a thousand
miles without any definite purpose or destination in view, it is
evident enough from his own narrative that he left Wyoming with the
fixed intention of verifying the rumors of a messiah. He has much to
say of the kindness of the whites they met west of the mountains, who,
it will be remembered, were largely Mormons, who have always manifested
a special interest in the Indians. He also states that many of the
whites took part with the Indians in the dance.

They were now in the messiah’s country. “The Fisheaters, near Pyramid
lake, told me that Christ had appeared on earth again. They said Christ
knew he was coming; that eleven of his children were also coming from a
far land. It appeared that Christ had sent for me to go there, and that
was why, unconsciously, I took my journey. It had been foreordained.
Christ had summoned myself and others from all heathen tribes. There
were more different languages than I had ever heard before, and I did
not understand any of them.” The delegation of which Porcupine was
a member was probably the one mentioned by the agent in charge at
Pyramid lake as having arrived in the spring of 1890, and consisting of
thirty-four Indians of different tribes. (_G. D., 19._)

In a few days preparations were made for a great dance near Walker
lake, with all the delegates from the various tribes and hundreds of
Indians in attendance. They danced two nights or longer, the messiah
himself—Wovoka—coming down from his home in Mason valley to lead the
ceremony. After the dance Wovoka went into a trance, and on awaking
announced to those assembled that he had been to the other world and
had seen the spirits of their dead friends and of his own father and
mother, and had been sent back to teach the people. According to
Porcupine he claimed to be the returned Christ and bore on his body
the scars of the crucifixion. He told them that the dead were to be
resurrected, and that as the earth was old and worn out it would be
renewed as it used to be and made better; that when this happened the
youth of everyone would be renewed with each return of spring, and that
they would live forever; that there would be universal peace, and that
any tribe that refused his message would be destroyed from the face of
the earth.

It was early in the spring of 1890 when Porcupine and his Cheyenne
companions returned to their tribe at Tongue River agency in Montana
with the news of the appearance of the messiah. A council was called
and Porcupine made a full report of the journey and delivered the
divine message, talking five days in succession. The report aroused
the wildest excitement among the Cheyenne, and after several long
debates on the subject the Ghost dance was inaugurated at the various
camps in accordance with the instructions from beyond the mountains.
In June the matter came to the attention of the military officer on
the reservation, who summoned Porcupine before him and obtained from
him a full account of the journey and the doctrine. (See page 793.)
Porcupine insisted strongly on the sacred character of the messiah and
his message, and challenged any doubters to return with him to Nevada
and investigate for themselves. He claimed also that the messiah could
speak all languages. As a matter of fact, Wovoka speaks only his native
Paiute and a little English, but due allowance must be made for the
mental exaltation of the narrator.

Grinnell states that the failure of certain things to happen according
to the predictions of the messiah, in September, 1890, caused a
temporary loss of faith on the part of the Cheyenne, but that shortly
afterward some visiting Shoshoni and Arapaho from Wyoming reported that
in their journey as they came over they had met a party of Indians who
had been dead thirty or forty years, but had been resurrected by the
messiah, and were now going about as if they had never died. It is
useless to speculate on the mental condition of men who could seriously
report or believe such things; but, however that may be, the result was
that the Cheyenne returned to the dance with redoubled fervor. (_J. F.
L., 5._)

The Sioux first heard of the messiah in 1889. According to the
statement of Captain George Sword, of that tribe, the information
came to the Ogalala (Sioux of Pine Ridge) in that year, through the
Shoshoni and Arapaho. Later in the same year a delegation consisting
of Good Thunder and several others started out to the west to find the
messiah and to investigate the truth of the rumor. On their return they
announced that the messiah had indeed come to help the Indians, but not
the whites. Their report aroused a fervor of joyful excitement among
the Indians and a second delegation was sent out in 1890, consisting of
Good Thunder, Cloud Horse, Yellow Knife, and Short Bull. They confirmed
the report of the first delegation, and on this assurance the Ghost
dance was inaugurated among the Sioux at Pine Ridge in the spring of
1890.

The matter is stated differently and more correctly by William Selwyn,
an educated Sioux, at that time employed as postmaster at Pine Ridge.
He says there was some talk on the subject by Indians from western
tribes who visited the agency in the fall of 1888 (?), but that it
did not excite much attention until 1889, when numerous letters
concerning the new messiah were received by the Indians at Pine Ridge
from tribes in Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Dakota, and Oklahoma. As Selwyn
was postmaster, the Indians who could not read usually brought their
letters to him to read for them, so that he was thus in position to
get accurate knowledge of the extent and nature of the excitement. It
may be remarked here that, under present conditions, when the various
tribes are isolated upon widely separated reservations, the Ghost dance
could never have become so widespread, and would probably have died
out within a year of its inception, had it not been for the efficient
aid it received from the returned pupils of various eastern government
schools, who conducted the sacred correspondence for their friends at
the different agencies, acted as interpreters for the delegates to the
messiah, and in various ways assumed the leadership and conduct of the
dance.

In the fall of 1889, at a council held at Pine Ridge by Red Cloud,
Young Man Afraid, Little Wound, American Horse, and other Sioux chiefs,
a delegation was appointed to visit the western agencies to learn more
about the new messiah. The delegates chosen were Good Thunder, Flat
Iron, Yellow Breast, and Broken Arm, from Pine Ridge; Short Bull and
another from Rosebud, and Kicking Bear from Cheyenne River agency.
They started on their journey to the west, and soon began to write
from Wyoming, Utah, and beyond the mountains, confirming all that had
been said of the advent of a redeemer. They were gone all winter,
and their return in the spring of 1890 aroused an intense excitement
among the Sioux, who had been anxiously awaiting their report. All the
delegates agreed that there was a man near the base of the Sierras
who said that he was the son of God, who had once been killed by the
whites, and who bore on his body the scars of the crucifixion. He had
now returned to punish the whites for their wickedness, especially
for their injustice toward the Indians. With the coming of the next
spring (1891) he would wipe the whites from the face of the earth, and
would then resurrect all the dead Indians, bring back the buffalo and
other game, and restore the supremacy of the aboriginal race. He had
before come to the whites, but they had rejected him. He was now the
God of the Indians, and they must pray to him and call him “father,”
and prepare for his awful coming. Selwyn’s account of this delegation,
which was accompanied by representatives of several other tribes,
including Porcupine the Cheyenne, and Sitting Bull the Arapaho, agrees
with the statements of the Arapaho as given in chapter +XIV+. Three of
the Sioux delegates found their way to Umatilla reservation in Oregon
and remained there several days discussing the new doctrine. (_Comr.,
30_—_Dorchester, 529_.)

The delegates made their report at Pine Ridge in April, 1890. A council
was at once called to discuss the matter, but Selwyn informed the
agent, Colonel Gallagher, who had Good Thunder and two others arrested
and imprisoned. They were held in confinement two days, but refused
to talk when questioned. The intended council was not held, but soon
afterward Kicking Bear returned from a visit to the northern Arapaho
in Wyoming with the news that those Indians were already dancing,
and could see and talk with their dead relatives in the trance. The
excitement which the agent had thought to smother by the arrest of the
leaders broke out again with added strength. Red Cloud himself, the
great chief of the Ogalala, declared his adhesion to the new doctrine
and said his people must do as the messiah had commanded. Another
council was called on White Clay creek, a few miles from Pine Ridge
agency, and the Ghost dance was formally inaugurated among the Sioux,
the recent delegates acting as priests and leaders of the ceremony.

As the result of all he could learn, Selwyn, in November, 1890, warned
the agent in charge of Yankton agency that the Indians intended
a general outbreak in the spring. Six months earlier, and before
Porcupine’s statement had been made to the officer at Camp Crook,
a letter dated May 29, 1890, had been addressed to the Interior
Department from a citizen of Pierre, South Dakota, stating that the
Sioux, or a portion of them, were secretly planning for an outbreak in
the near future. This was the first intimation of trouble ahead. (_G.
D., 20._)

Wonderful things were said of the messiah by the returned delegates.
It was claimed that he could make animals talk and distant objects
appear close at hand, and that he came down from heaven in a cloud. He
conjured up before their eyes a vision of the spirit world, so that
when they looked they beheld an ocean, and beyond it a land upon which
they saw “all the nations of Indians coming home,” but as they looked
the vision faded away, the messiah saying that the time had not yet
come. Curiously enough, although he came to restore the old life, he
advised his hearers to go to work and to send their children to school.
Should the soldiers attempt to harm him, he said he need only stretch
out his arms and his enemies would become powerless, or the ground
would open and swallow them. On their way home if they should kill a
buffalo—the messiah had evidently not read Allen’s monograph—they must
cut off its head and tail and feet and leave them on the ground and the
buffalo would come to life again. They must tell their people to follow
his instructions. Unbelievers and renegade Indians would be buried
under the new earth which was to come upon the old. They must use the
sacred red and white paint and the sacred grass (possibly sagebrush)
which he gave them, and in the spring, when the green grass came, their
people who were gone before would return, and they would see their
friends again.

Now comes the most remarkable part, quoting from the statement given to
Captain Sword:

  The people from every tipi send for us to visit them; they are
  people who died many years ago. Chasing Hawk, who died not long
  ago, was there and we went to his tipi. He was living with his
  wife, who was killed in war long ago. They live in a buffalo skin
  tipi—a very large one—and he wanted all his friends to go there
  to live. A son of Good Thunder, who died in war long ago, was one
  who also took us to his tipi, so his father saw him. When coming
  we come to a herd of buffaloes. We killed one and took everything
  except the four feet, head, and tail, and when we came a little
  ways from it there was the buffaloes come to life again and went
  off. This was one of the messiah’s word came to truth. The messiah
  said, “I will short your journey when you feel tired of the long
  ways, if you call upon me.” This we did when we were tired. The
  night came upon us, we stopped at a place and we called upon the
  messiah to help us because we were tired of long journey. We went
  to sleep and in the morning we found ourselves at a great distance
  from where we stopped.

It is useless to assert that these men, who had been selected by
the chiefs of their tribe to investigate and report upon the truth
or falsity of the messiah rumors, were all liars, and that all the
Cheyenne, Arapaho, and other delegates who reported equally wonderful
things were liars likewise. They were simply laboring under some
strange psychologic influence as yet unexplained. The story of the
revivified buffalo became so widely current as to form the subject of a
Kiowa ghost song.

Having mentioned some characteristics of the Ghost dance west of the
Rockies, we shall notice here some of the peculiar features of the
dance as it existed among the Sioux. The ceremony will be described in
detail later on.

Before going into the dance the men, or at least the leaders, fasted
for twenty-four hours, and then at sunrise entered the sweat-house for
the religious rite of purification preliminary to painting themselves
for the dance. The sweat-house is a small circular framework of willow
branches driven into the ground and bent over and brought together at
the top in such a way that when covered with blankets or buffalo robes
the structure forms a diminutive round-top tipi just high enough to
enable several persons to sit or to stand in a stooping posture inside.
The doorway faces the east, as is the rule in Indian structures, and at
the distance of a few feet in front of the doorway is a small mound of
earth, on which is placed a buffalo skull, with the head turned as if
looking into the lodge. The earth of which the mound is formed is taken
from a hole dug in the center of the lodge. Near the sweat-house, on
the outside, there is frequently a tall sacrifice pole, from the top of
which are hung strips of bright-colored cloth, packages of tobacco, or
other offerings to the deity invoked by the devotee on any particular
occasion.

The sweat bath is in frequent use, both as a religious rite of
purification and as a hygienic treatment. Like everything else in
Indian life, even the sanitary application is attended with much detail
of religious ceremony. Fresh bundles of the fragrant wild sage are
strewn upon the ground inside of the sweat-house, and a fire is kindled
outside a short distance away. In this fire stones are heated by the
medicine-men, and when all is ready the patient or devotee, stripped
to the breechcloth, enters the sweat-house. The stones are then handed
in to him by the priests by means of two forked sticks, cut especially
for the purpose, and with two other forked sticks he puts the stones
into the hole already mentioned as having been dug in the center of
the lodge. Water is then passed in to him, which he pours over the hot
stones until the whole interior is filled with steam; the blankets are
pulled tight to close every opening, and he sits in this aboriginal
Turkish bath until his naked body is dripping with perspiration. During
this time the doctors outside are doing their part in the way of
praying to the gods and keeping up the supply of hot stones and water
until in their estimation he has been sufficiently purified, physically
or morally, when he emerges and resumes his clothing, sometimes first
checking the perspiration and inducing a reaction by a plunge into the
neighboring stream. The sweat bath in one form or another was common to
almost every tribe in the United States, but as an accompaniment to the
Ghost dance it seems to have been used only by the Sioux. It may have
been used in this connection among the Shoshoni or northern Cheyenne,
but was not among any of the tribes of the southern plains. The
Ghost-dance sweat-house of the Sioux was frequently made sufficiently
large to accommodate a considerable number of persons standing inside
at the same time.

  SIOUX SWEAT-HOUSE AND SACRIFICE POLE]

After the sweating ceremony the dancer was painted by the medicine-men
who acted as leaders, of whom Sitting Bull was accounted the greatest
among the Sioux. The design and color varied with the individual, being
frequently determined by a previous trance vision of the subject, but
circles, crescents, and crosses, representing respectively the sun, the
moon, and the morning star, were always favorite figures upon forehead,
face, and cheeks. As this was not a naked dance, the rest of the body
was not usually painted. After the painting the dancer was robed in
the sacred ghost shirt already described. This also was painted with,
symbolic figures, among which were usually represented sun, moon, or
stars, the eagle, magpie, crow, or sage-hen, all sacred to the Ghost
dance among the Sioux. In connection with the painting the face and
body were rubbed with the sweet-smelling vernal grass (_Hierochloe_),
used for this purpose by many of the prairie tribes, and sometimes also
burned as incense in their sacred ceremonies or carried as a perfume in
small pouches attached to the clothing.

The painting occupied most of the morning, so that it was about noon
before the participants formed the circle for the dance. Among the
Sioux, unlike the southern and western tribes generally, a small tree
was planted in the center of the circle, with an American flag or
colored streamers floating from the top. Around the base of this tree
sat the priests. At a great dance at No Water’s camp on White river
near Pine Ridge, shortly before the arrival of the troops, a young
woman standing within the circle gave the signal for the performance by
shooting into the air toward the cardinal points four sacred arrows,
made after the old primitive fashion with bone heads, and dipped in
the blood of a steer before being brought to the dance. These were
then gathered up and tied to the branches of the tree, together with
the bow, a gaming wheel and sticks, and a peculiar staff or wand with
horns. (See plates +XC+, +XCI+.) Another young woman, or the same one,
remained standing near the tree throughout the dance, holding a sacred
redstone pipe stretched out toward the west, the direction from which
the messiah was to appear.

At the beginning the performers, men and women, sat on the ground in a
large circle around the tree. A plaintive chant was then sung, after
which a vessel of some sacred food was passed around the circle until
everyone had partaken, when, at a signal by the priests, the dancers
rose to their feet, joined hands, and began to chant the opening song
and move slowly around the circle from right to left. The rest of the
performance, with its frenzies, trances, and recitals of visions, was
the same as with the southern tribes, as will be described in detail
hereafter. Like these tribes also, the Sioux usually selected Sunday,
the great medicine day of the white man, for the ceremony.

We come now to the Sioux outbreak of 1890, but before going into the
history of this short but costly war it is appropriate to state briefly
the causes of the outbreak. In the documentary appendix to this chapter
these causes are fully set forth by competent authorities—civilian,
military, missionary, and Indian. They may be summarized as (1) unrest
of the conservative element under the decay of the old life, (2)
repeated neglect of promises made by the government, and (3) hunger.

The Sioux are the largest and strongest tribe within the United States.
In spite of wars, removals, and diminished food supply since the advent
of the white man, they still number nearly 26,000. In addition to
these there are about 600 more residing in Canada. They formerly held
the headwaters of the Mississippi, extending eastward almost to Lake
Superior, but were driven into the prairie about two centuries ago by
their enemies, the Ojibwa, after the latter had obtained firearms from
the French. On coming out on the buffalo plains they became possessed
of the horse, by means of which reinforcement to their own overpowering
numbers the Sioux were soon enabled to assume the offensive, and
in a short time had made themselves the undisputed masters of an
immense territory extending, in a general way, from Minnesota to the
Rocky mountains and from the Yellowstone to the Platte. A few small
tribes were able to maintain their position within these limits, but
only by keeping close to their strongly built permanent villages on
the Missouri. Millions of buffalo to furnish unlimited food supply,
thousands of horses, and hundreds of miles of free range made the
Sioux, up to the year 1868, the richest and most prosperous, the
proudest, and withal, perhaps, the wildest of all the tribes of the
plains.

In that year, in pursuance of a policy inaugurated for bringing all the
plains tribes under the direct control of the government, a treaty was
negotiated with the Sioux living west of the Missouri by which they
renounced their claims to a great part of their territory and had “set
apart for their absolute and undisturbed use and occupation”—so the
treaty states—a reservation which embraced all of the present state
of South Dakota west of Missouri river. At the same time agents were
appointed and agencies established for them; annuities and rations,
cows, physicians, farmers, teachers, and other good things were
promised them, and they agreed to allow railroad routes to be surveyed
and built and military posts to be established in their territory and
neighborhood. At one stroke they were reduced from a free nation to
dependent wards of the government. It was stipulated also that they
should be allowed to hunt within their old range, outside the limits of
the reservation, so long as the buffalo abounded—a proviso which, to
the Indians, must have meant forever.

The reservation thus established was an immense one, and would have
been ample for all the Sioux while being gradually educated toward
civilization, could the buffalo have remained and the white man kept
away. But the times were changing. The building of the railroads
brought into the plains swarms of hunters and emigrants, who began
to exterminate the buffalo at such a rate that in a few years the
Sioux, with all the other hunting tribes of the plains, realized that
their food supply was rapidly going. Then gold was discovered in the
Black hills, within the reservation, and at once thousands of miners
and other thousands of lawless desperadoes rushed into the country
in defiance of the protests of the Indians and the pledges of the
government, and the Sioux saw their last remaining hunting ground
taken from them. The result was the Custer war and massacre, and a new
agreement in 1876 by which the Sioux were shorn of one-third of their
guaranteed reservation, including the Black hills, and this led to deep
and widespread dissatisfaction throughout the tribe. The conservatives
brooded over the past and planned opposition to further changes which
they felt themselves unable to meet. The progressives felt that the
white man’s promises meant nothing.

On this point Commissioner Morgan says, in his statement of the causes
of the outbreak:

  Prior to the agreement of 1876 buffalo and deer were the main
  support of the Sioux. Food, tents, bedding were the direct outcome
  of hunting, and with furs and pelts as articles of barter or
  exchange it was easy for the Sioux to procure whatever constituted
  for them the necessaries, the comforts, or even the luxuries
  of life. Within eight years from the agreement of 1876 the
  buffalo had gone and the Sioux had left to them alkali land and
  government rations. It is hard to overestimate the magnitude of
  the calamity, as they viewed it, which happened to these people by
  the sudden disappearance of the buffalo and the large diminution
  in the numbers of deer and other wild animals. Suddenly, almost
  without warning, they were expected at once and without previous
  training to settle down to the pursuits of agriculture in a land
  largely unfitted for such use. The freedom of the chase was to be
  exchanged for the idleness of the camp. The boundless range was
  to be abandoned for the circumscribed reservation, and abundance
  of plenty to be supplanted by limited and decreasing government
  subsistence and supplies. Under these circumstances it is not in
  human nature not to be discontented and restless, even turbulent
  and violent. (_Comr., 28._)

It took our own Aryan ancestors untold centuries to develop from
savagery into civilization. Was it reasonable to expect that the Sioux
could do the same in fourteen years?

The white population in the Black hills had rapidly increased, and it
had become desirable to open communication between eastern and western
Dakota. To accomplish this, it was proposed to cut out the heart of
the Sioux reservation, and in 1882, only six years after the Black
hills had been seized, the Sioux were called on to surrender more
territory. A commission was sent out to treat with them, but the price
offered—only about 8 cents per acre—was so absurdly small, and the
methods used so palpably unjust, that friends of the Indians interposed
and succeeded in defeating the measure in Congress. Another agreement
was prepared, but experience had made the Indians suspicious, and it
was not until a third commission went out, under the chairmanship of
General Crook, known to the Indians as a brave soldier and an honorable
man, that the Sioux consented to treat. (_Welsh, 1._) The result, after
much effort on the part of the commission and determined opposition
by the conservatives, was another agreement, in 1889, by which the
Sioux surrendered one-half (about 11,000,000 acres) of their remaining
territory, and the great reservation was cut up into five smaller ones,
the northern and southern reservations being separated by a strip 60
miles wide.

Then came a swift accumulation of miseries. Dakota is an arid country
with thin soil and short seasons. Although well adapted to grazing it
is not suited to agriculture, as is sufficiently proven by the fact
that the white settlers in that and the adjoining state of Nebraska
have several times been obliged to call for state or federal assistance
on account of failure of crops. To wild Indians hardly in from the
warpath the problem was much more serious. As General Miles points out
in his official report, thousands of white settlers after years of
successive failures had given up the struggle and left the country, but
the Indians, confined to reservations, were unable to emigrate, and
were also as a rule unable to find employment, as the whites might, by
which they could earn a subsistence. The buffalo was gone. They must
depend on their cattle, their crops, and the government rations issued
in return for the lands they had surrendered. If these failed, they
must starve. The highest official authorities concur in the statement
that all of these did fail, and that the Indians were driven to
outbreak by starvation. (See appendix to this chapter.)

In 1888 their cattle had been diminished by disease. In 1889 their
crops were a failure, owing largely to the fact that the Indians had
been called into the agency in the middle of the farming season and
kept there to treat with the commission, going back afterward to find
their fields trampled and torn up by stock during their absence. Then
followed epidemics of measles, grippe, and whooping cough, in rapid
succession and with terribly fatal results. Anyone who understands
the Indian character needs not the testimony of witnesses to know the
mental effect thus produced. Sullenness and gloom, amounting almost
to despair, settled down on the Sioux, especially among the wilder
portion. “The people said their children were all dying from the face
of the earth, and they might as well be killed at once.” Then came
another entire failure of crops in 1890, and an unexpected reduction
of rations, and the Indians were brought face to face with starvation.
They had been expressly and repeatedly told by the commission that
their rations would not be affected by their signing the treaty, but
immediately on the consummation of the agreement Congress cut down
their beef rations by 2,000,000 pounds at Rosebud, 1,000,000 at Pine
Ridge, and in less proportion at other agencies. Earnest protest
against this reduction was made by the commission which had negotiated
the treaty, by Commissioner Morgan, and by General Miles, but still
Congress failed to remedy the matter until the Sioux had actually
been driven to rebellion. As Commissioner Morgan states, “It was not
until January, 1891, _after the troubles_, that an appropriation of
$100,000 was made by Congress for additional beef for the Sioux.” The
protest of the commission, a full year before the outbreak, as quoted
by Commissioner Morgan (see page 829), is strong and positive on this
point.

Commissioner Morgan, while claiming that the Sioux had before been
receiving more rations than they were justly entitled to according
to their census number, and denying that the reduction was such as
to cause even extreme suffering, yet states that the reduction was
especially unwise at this juncture, as it was in direct violation of
the promises made to the Indians, and would be used as an argument
by those opposed to the treaty to show that the government cared
nothing for the Indians after it had obtained their lands. It is
quite possible that the former number of rations was greater than the
actual number of persons, as it is always a difficult matter to count
roving Indians, and the difficulties were greater when the old census
was made. The census is taken at long intervals and the tendency is
nearly always toward a decrease. Furthermore, it has usually been the
policy with agents to hold their Indians quiet by keeping them as
well fed as possible. On the other hand, it must be remembered that
the issue is based on the weight of the cattle as delivered at the
agency in the fall, and that months of exposure to a Dakota winter
will reduce this weight by several hundred pounds to the animal. The
official investigation by Captain Hurst at Cheyenne River agency shows
conclusively that the essential food items of meat, flour, and coffee
were far below the amount stipulated by the treaty. (See page 837.)

In regard to the effect of this food deficiency Bishop Hare says: “The
people were often hungry and, the physicians in many cases said, died,
when taken sick, not so much from disease as for want of food.” General
Miles says: “The fact that they had not received sufficient food is
admitted by the agents and the officers of the government who have
had opportunities of knowing,” and in another place he states that in
spite of crop failures and other difficulties, after the sale of the
reservation “instead of an increase, or even a reasonable supply for
their support, they have been compelled to live on half and two-thirds
rations and received nothing for the surrender of their lands.” The
testimony from every agency is all to the same effect.

There were other causes of dissatisfaction, some local and others
general and chronic, which need not be detailed here. Some of these
are treated in the documents appended to this chapter. Prominent among
them were the failure of Congress to make payment of the money due the
Sioux for the lands recently ceded, or to have the new lines surveyed
promptly so that the Indians might know what was still theirs and
select their allotments accordingly; failure to reimburse the friendly
Indians for horses confiscated fourteen years before; the tardy arrival
of annuities, consisting largely of winter clothing, which according
to the treaty were due by the 1st of August, but which seldom arrived
until the middle of winter; the sweeping and frequent changes of agency
employees from the agent down, preventing anything like a systematic
working out of any consistent policy, and almost always operating
against the good of the service, especially at Pine Ridge, where so
brave and efficient a man as McGillycuddy was followed by such a one as
Royer—and, finally, the Ghost dance.

The Ghost dance itself, in the form which it assumed among the
Sioux, was only a symptom and expression of the real causes of
dissatisfaction, and with such a man as McGillycuddy or McLaughlin
in charge at Pine Ridge there would have been no outbreak, in spite
of broken promises and starvation, and the Indians could have been
controlled until Congress had afforded relief. That it was not the
cause of the outbreak is sufficiently proved by the fact that there
was no serious trouble, excepting on the occasion of the attempt to
arrest Sitting Bull, on any other of the Sioux reservations, and none
at all among any of the other Ghost-dancing tribes from the Missouri to
the Sierras, although the doctrine and the dance were held by nearly
every tribe within that area and are still held by the more important.
Among the Paiute, where the doctrine originated and the messiah has his
home, there was never the slightest trouble. It is significant that
Commissioner Morgan in his official statement of the causes of the
outbreak places the “messiah craze” eleventh in a list of twelve, the
twelfth being the alarm created by the appearance of troops. The Sioux
outbreak of 1890 was due entirely to local grievances, recent or long
standing. The remedy and preventive for similar trouble in the future
is sufficiently indicated in the appended statements of competent
authorities.


                    APPENDIX—CAUSES OF THE OUTBREAK

                    COMMISSIONER MORGAN’S STATEMENT

        [_From the Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs
                     for 1891, Vol. I, 132–135._]

In stating the events which led to this outbreak among the Sioux,
the endeavor too often has been merely to find some opportunity for
locating blame. The causes are complex, and many are obscure and
remote. Among them may be named the following:

First. A feeling of unrest and apprehension in the mind of the Indians
has naturally grown out of the rapid advance in civilization and the
great changes which this advance has necessitated in their habits and
mode of life.

Second. Prior to the agreement of 1876 buffalo and deer were the main
support of the Sioux. Food, tents, bedding were the direct outcome of
hunting, and, with furs and pelts as articles of barter or exchange,
it was easy for the Sioux to procure whatever constituted for them the
necessaries, the comforts, or even the luxuries of life. Within eight
years from the agreement of 1876 the buffalo had gone, and the Sioux
had left to them alkali land and government rations. It is hard to
overestimate the magnitude of the calamity, as they viewed it, which
happened to these people by the sudden disappearance of the buffalo and
the large diminution in the numbers of deer and other wild animals.
Suddenly, almost without warning, they were expected at once and
without previous training to settle down to the pursuits of agriculture
in a land largely unfitted for such use. The freedom of the chase was
to be exchanged for the idleness of the camp. The boundless range
was to be abandoned for the circumscribed reservation, and abundance
of plenty to be supplanted by limited and decreasing government
subsistence and supplies. Under these circumstances it is not in human
nature not to be discontented and restless, even turbulent and violent.

Third. During a long series of years, treaties, agreements, cessions
of land and privileges, and removals of bands and agencies have kept
many of the Sioux, particularly those at Pine Ridge and Rosebud, in
an unsettled condition, especially as some of the promises made them
were fulfilled tardily or not at all. (A brief history of negotiations
with the Sioux was given in my letter of December 24, 1890, to the
Department, which will be found in the appendix, page 182.)

Fourth. The very large reduction of the great Sioux reservation,
brought about by the Sioux commission through the consent of the
large majority of the adult males, was bitterly opposed by a large,
influential minority. For various reasons, they regarded the cession
as unwise, and did all in their power to prevent its consummation, and
afterwards were constant in their expressions of dissatisfaction and
in their endeavors to awaken a like feeling in the minds of those who
signed the agreement.

Fifth. There was diminution and partial failure of the crops for 1889,
by reason of their neglect by the Indians, who were congregated in
large numbers at the council with the Sioux commission, and a further
diminution of ordinary crops by the drought of 1890. Also, in 1888, the
disease of black leg appeared among the cattle of the Indians.

Sixth. At this time, by delayed and reduced appropriations, the Sioux
rations were temporarily cut down. Rations were not diminished to
such an extent as to bring the Indians to starvation or even extreme
suffering, as has been often reported; but short rations came just
after the Sioux commission had negotiated the agreement for the cession
of lands, and, as a condition of securing the signatures of the
majority, had assured the Indians that their rations would be continued
unchanged. To this matter the Sioux commission called special attention
in their report dated December 24, 1889, as follows:

“During our conference at the different agencies we were repeatedly
asked whether the acceptance or rejection of the act of Congress
would influence the action of the government with reference to
their rations, and in every instance the Indians were assured that
subsistence was furnished in accordance with former treaties, and that
signing would not affect their rations, and that they would continue
to receive them as provided in former treaties. Without our assurances
to this effect it would have been impossible to have secured their
consent to the cession of their lands. Since our visit to the agencies
it appears that large reductions have been made in the amounts of
beef furnished for issues, amounting at Rosebud to 2,000,000 pounds
and at Pine Ridge to 1,000,000 pounds, and lesser amounts at the
other agencies. This action of the Department, following immediately
after the successful issue of our negotiations, can not fail to have
an injurious effect. It will be impossible to convince the Indians
that the reduction is not due to the fact that the government,
having obtained their land, has less concern in looking after their
material interests than before. It will be looked upon as a breach of
faith and especially as a violation of the express statements of the
commissioners. Already this action is being used by the Indians opposed
to the bill, notably at Pine Ridge, as an argument in support of the
wisdom of their opposition.”

In forwarding this report to Congress the Department called special
attention to the above-quoted statements of the commission and said:
“The commission further remarks that as to the quality of the rations
furnished there seems to be no just cause for complaint, but that it
was particularly to be avoided that there should be any diminution of
the rations promised under the former treaties at this time, as the
Indians would attribute it to their assent to the bill. Such diminution
certainly should not be allowed, as the government is bound in good
faith to carry into effect the former treaties where not directly and
positively affected by the act, and if under the provisions of the
treaty itself the ration is at any time reduced, the commissioners
recommend that the Indians should be notified before spring opens, so
that crops may be cultivated. It is desirable that the recent reduction
made should be restored, as it is now impossible to convince the
Indians that it was not due to the fact that the government, having
obtained their lands, had less concern in looking after their material
interests.”

Notwithstanding this plea of the commission and of the Department, the
appropriation made for the subsistence and civilization of the Sioux
for 1890 was only $950,000, or $50,000 less than the amount estimated
and appropriated for 1888 and 1889, and the appropriation not having
been made until August 19, rations had to be temporarily purchased and
issued in limited quantities pending arrival of new supplies to be
secured from that appropriation. It was not until January, 1891, after
the troubles, that an appropriation of $100,000 was made by Congress
for additional beef for the Sioux.

Seventh. Other promises made by the Sioux commission and the agreement
were not promptly fulfilled; among them were increase of appropriations
for education, for which this office had asked an appropriation of
$150,000; the payment of $200,000 in compensation for ponies taken from
the Sioux in 1876 and 1877; and the reimbursement of the Crow Creek
Indians for a reduction made in their per capita allowance of land,
as compared with the amount allowed other Sioux, which called for an
appropriation of $187,039. The fulfillment of all these promises except
the last named was contained in the act of January 19, 1891.

Eighth. In 1889 and 1890 epidemics of la grippe, measles, and whooping
cough, followed by many deaths, added to the gloom and misfortune which
seemed to surround the Indians.

Ninth. The wording of the agreement changed the boundary line between
the Rosebud and Pine Ridge diminished reservations and necessitated a
removal of a portion of the Rosebud Indians from the lands which, by
the agreement, were included in the Pine Ridge reservation to lands
offered them in lieu thereof upon the diminished Rosebud reserve. This,
although involving no great hardship to any considerable number, added
to the discontent.

Tenth. Some of the Indians were greatly opposed to the census which
Congress ordered should be taken. The census at Rosebud, as reported
by Special Agent Lea and confirmed by a special census taken by
Agent Wright, revealed the somewhat startling fact that rations had
been issued to Indians very largely in excess of the number actually
present, and this diminution of numbers as shown by the census
necessitated a diminution of the rations, which was based, of course,
upon the census.

Eleventh. The Messiah craze, which fostered the belief that “ghost
shirts” would be invulnerable to bullets, and that the supremacy of the
Indian race was assured, added to discontent the fervor of fanaticism
and brought those who accepted the new faith into the attitude of
sullen defiance, but defensive rather than aggressive.

Twelfth. The sudden appearance of military upon their reservation
gave rise to the wildest rumors among the Indians of danger and
disaster, which were eagerly circulated by disaffected Indians and
corroborated by exaggerated accounts in the newspapers, and these and
other influences connected with and inseparable from military movements
frightened many Indians away from their agencies into the bad lands and
largely intensified whatever spirit of opposition to the government
existed.


                   EX-AGENT McGILLYCUDDY’S STATEMENT

  [_Letter of Dr V. T. McGillycuddy, formerly agent at Pine Ridge,
    written in reply to inquiry from General L. W. Colby, commanding
    Nebraska state troops during the outbreak, and dated January
    15, 1891. From article on “The Sioux Indian War of 1890–91,” by
    General L. W. Colby, in Transactions and Reports of the Nebraska
    State Historical Society, III, 1892, pages 176–180._]

+Sir+: In answer to your inquiry of a recent date, I would state that
in my opinion to no one cause can be attributed the recent so-called
outbreak on the part of the Sioux, but rather to a combination of
causes gradually cumulative in their effect and dating back through
many years—in fact to the inauguration of our practically demonstrated
faulty Indian policy.

There can be no question but that many of the treaties, agreements, or
solemn promises made by our government with these Indians have been
broken. Many of them have been kept by us technically, but as far as
the Indian is concerned have been misunderstood by him through a lack
of proper explanation at time of signing, and hence considered by him
as broken.

It must also be remembered that in all of the treaties made by the
government with the Indians, a large portion of them have not agreed to
or signed the same. Noticeably was this so in the agreement secured by
us with them the summer before last, by which we secured one-half of
the remainder of the Sioux reserve, amounting to about 16,000 square
miles. This agreement barely carried with the Sioux nation as a whole,
but did not carry at Pine Ridge or Rosebud, where the strong majority
were against it; and it must be noted that wherever there was the
strongest opposition manifested to the recent treaty, there, during the
present trouble, have been found the elements opposed to the government.

The Sioux nation, which at one time, with the confederated bands of
Cheyennes and Arapahos, controlled a region of country bounded on the
north by the Yellowstone, on the south by the Arkansas, and reaching
from the Missouri river to the Rocky mountains, has seen this large
domain, under the various treaties, dwindle down to their now limited
reserve of less than 16,000 square miles, and with the land has
disappeared the buffalo and other game. The memory of this, chargeable
by them to the white man, necessarily irritates them.

There is back of all this the natural race antagonism which our
dealings with the aborigine in connection with the inevitable onward
march of civilization has in no degree lessened. It has been our
experience, and the experience of other nations, that defeat in war is
soon, not sooner or later, forgotten by the coming generation, and as
a result we have a tendency to a constant recurrence of outbreak on
the part of the weaker race. It is now sixteen years since our last
war with the Sioux in 1876—a time when our present Sioux warriors were
mostly children, and therefore have no memory of having felt the power
of the government. It is but natural that these young warriors, lacking
in experience, should require but little incentive to induce them to
test the bravery of the white man on the war path, where the traditions
of his people teach him is the only path to glory and a chosen seat
in the “happy hunting grounds.” For these reasons every precaution
should be adopted by the government to guard against trouble with its
disastrous results. Have such precautions been adopted? Investigation
of the present trouble does not so indicate.

Sitting Bull and other irreconcilable relics of the campaign of 1876
were allowed to remain among their people and foment discord. The
staple article of food at Pine Ridge and some of the other agencies
had been cut down below the subsisting point, noticeably the beef at
Pine Ridge, which from an annual treaty allowance of 6,250,000 pounds
gross was cut down to 4,000,000 pounds. The contract on that beef was
violated, insomuch as that contract called for northern ranch beef, for
which was substituted through beef from Texas, with an unparalleled
resulting shrinkage in winter, so that the Indians did not actually
receive half ration of this food in winter—the very time the largest
allowance of food is required. By the fortunes of political war, weak
agents were placed in charge of some of the agencies at the very time
that trouble was known to be brewing. Noticeably was this so at Pine
Ridge, where a notoriously weak and unfit man was placed in charge. His
flight, abandonment of his agency, and his call for troops have, with
the horrible results of the same, become facts in history.

Now, as for facts in connection with Pine Ridge, which agency has
unfortunately become the theater of the present “war,” was there
necessity for troops? My past experience with those Indians does not so
indicate. For seven long years, from 1879 to 1886, I, as agent, managed
this agency without the presence of a soldier on the reservation,
and none nearer than 60 miles, and in those times the Indians were
naturally much wilder than they are to-day. To be sure, during the
seven years we occasionally had exciting times, when the only thing
lacking to cause an outbreak was the calling for troops by the agent
and the presence of the same. As a matter of fact, however, no matter
how much disturbed affairs were, no matter how imminent an outbreak,
the progressive chiefs, with their following, came to the front enough
in the majority, with the fifty Indian policemen, to at once crush out
all attempts at rebellion against the authority of the agent and the
government.

Why was this? Because in those times we believed in placing confidence
in the Indians; in establishing, as far as possible, a home-rule
government on the reservation. We established local courts, presided
over by the Indians, with Indian juries; in fact, we believed in
having the Indians assist in working out their own salvation. We
courted and secured the friendship and support of the progressive and
orderly element, as against the mob element. Whether the system thus
inaugurated was practicable, was successful, comparison with recent
events will decide.

When my Democratic successor took charge in 1886, he deemed it
necessary to make general changes in the system at Pine Ridge, i. e.,
a Republican system. All white men, half-breeds, or Indians who had
sustained the agent under the former administration were classed as
Republicans and had to go. The progressive chiefs, such as Young Man
Afraid, Little Wound, and White Bird, were ignored, and the backing
of the element of order and progress was alienated from the agent
and the government, and in the place of this strong backing that had
maintained order for seven years was substituted Red Cloud and other
nonprogressive chiefs, sustainers of the ancient tribal system.

If my successor had been other than an amateur, or had had any
knowledge or experience in the inside Indian politics of an Indian
tribe, he would have known that if the element he was endeavoring to
relegate to the rear had not been the balance of power, I could not for
seven years have held out against the mob element which he now sought
to put in power. In other words, he unwittingly threw the balance of
power at Pine Ridge against the government, as he later on discovered
to his cost. When still later he endeavored to maintain order and
suppress the ghost dance, the attempt resulted in a most dismal failure.

The Democratic agent was succeeded in October last by the recently
removed Republican agent, a gentleman totally ignorant of Indians
and their peculiarities; a gentleman with not a qualification in his
make-up calculated to fit him for the position of agent at one of
the largest and most difficult agencies in the service to manage;
a man selected solely as a reward for political services. He might
possibly have been an average success as an Indian agent at a small,
well-regulated agency. He endeavored to strengthen up matters, but the
chiefs and leaders who could have assisted him in so doing had been
alienated by the former agent. They virtually said among themselves,
“We, after incurring the enmity of the bad element among our people
by sustaining the government, have been ignored and ill-treated by
that government, hence this is not our affair.” Being ignorant of the
situation, he had no one to depend on. In his first clash with the mob
element he discovered that the Pine Ridge police, formerly the finest
in the service, were lacking in discipline and courage, and, not being
well supplied with those necessary qualities himself, he took the bluff
of a mob for a declaration of war, abandoned his agency, returned with
troops—and you see the result.

As for the ghost dance, too much attention has been paid to it. It was
only the symptom or surface indication of deep-rooted, long-existing
difficulty; as well treat the eruption of smallpox as the disease and
ignore the constitutional disease.

As regards disarming the Sioux, however desirable it may appear, I
consider it neither advisable nor practicable. I fear that it will
result as the theoretical enforcement of prohibition in Kansas, Iowa,
and Dakota; you will succeed in disarming the friendly Indians, because
you can, and you will not so succeed with the mob element, because you
can not. If I were again to be an Indian agent and had my choice, I
would take charge of 10,000 armed Sioux in preference to a like number
of disarmed ones; and, furthermore, agree to handle that number, or the
whole Sioux nation, without a white soldier.

    Respectfully, etc.,                          +V. T. McGillycuddy+.

P.S.—I neglected to state that up to date there has been neither a
Sioux outbreak nor war. No citizen in Nebraska or Dakota has been
killed, molested, or can show the scratch of a pin, and no property has
been destroyed off the reservation.


                      STATEMENT OF GENERAL MILES

  [_From the Report of the Secretary of War for 1891, Vol. I, pp.
    133, 134, and 149. He enumerates specific causes of complaint at
    each of the principal Sioux agencies, all of which causes may be
    summarized as hunger and unfulfilled promises._]

_Cause of Indian dissatisfaction._—The causes that led to the serious
disturbance of the peace in the northwest last autumn and winter were
so remarkable that an explanation of them is necessary in order to
comprehend the seriousness of the situation. The Indians assuming the
most threatening attitude of hostility were the Cheyennes and Sioux.
Their condition may be stated as follows: For several years following
their subjugation in 1877, 1878, and 1879 the most dangerous element
of the Cheyennes and the Sioux were under military control. Many of
them were disarmed and dismounted; their war ponies were sold and the
proceeds returned to them in domestic stock, farming utensils, wagons,
etc. Many of the Cheyennes, under the charge of military officers, were
located on land in accordance with the laws of Congress, but after they
were turned over to civil agents and the vast herds of buffalo and
large game had been destroyed their supplies were insufficient, and
they were forced to kill cattle belonging to white people to sustain
life.

The fact that they had not received sufficient food is admitted by the
agents and the officers of the government who have had opportunities
of knowing. The majority of the Sioux were under the charge of civil
agents, frequently changed and often inexperienced. Many of the
tribes became rearmed and remounted. They claimed that the government
had not fulfilled its treaties and had failed to make large enough
appropriations for their support; that they had suffered for want of
food, and the evidence of this is beyond question and sufficient to
satisfy any unprejudiced intelligent mind. The statements of officers,
inspectors, both of the military and the Interior departments, of
agents, of missionaries, and civilians familiar with their condition,
leave no room for reasonable doubt that this was one of the principal
causes. While statements may be made as to the amount of money that
has been expended by the government to feed the different tribes, the
manner of distributing those appropriations will furnish one reason for
the deficit.

The unfortunate failure of the crops in the plains country during
the years of 1889 and 1890 added to the distress and suffering of
the Indians, and it was possible for them to raise but very little
from the ground for self-support; in fact, white settlers have been
most unfortunate, and their losses have been serious and universal
throughout a large section of that country. They have struggled on from
year to year; occasionally they would raise good crops, which they were
compelled to sell at low prices, while in the season of drought their
labor was almost entirely lost. So serious have been their misfortunes
that thousands have left that country within the last few years,
passing over the mountains to the Pacific slope or returning to the
east of the Missouri or the Mississippi.

The Indians, however, could not migrate from one part of the United
States to another; neither could they obtain employment as readily as
white people, either upon or beyond the Indian reservations. They must
remain in comparative idleness and accept the results of the drought—an
insufficient supply of food. This created a feeling of discontent even
among the loyal and well disposed and added to the feeling of hostility
of the element opposed to every process of civilization.

Reports forwarded by Brigadier-General Ruger, commanding Department of
Dakota, contained the following:

The commanding officer at Fort Yates, North Dakota, under date of
December 7, 1890, at the time the Messiah delusion was approaching a
climax, says, in reference to the disaffection of the Sioux Indians at
Standing Rock agency, that it is due to the following causes:

(1) Failure of the government to establish an equitable southern
boundary of the Standing Rock agency reservation.

(2) Failure of the government to expend a just proportion of the money
received from the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad company,
for right of way privileges, for the benefit of the Indians of said
agency. Official notice was received October 18, 1881, by the Indian
agent at the Standing Rock agency, that the said railroad company had
paid the government under its agreement with the Sioux Indians, for
right of way privileges, the sum of $13,911. What additional payments,
if any, have been made by the said railroad company, and what payments
have been made by the Dakota Central railroad company, the records of
the agency do not show. In 1883, and again in 1885, the agent, upon
complaints made by the Indians, wrote to the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs, making certain recommendations as regards the expenditure of
the money received from the said railroad company, but was in each
instance informed that until Congress took action with respect to the
funds referred to nothing could be done. No portion of the money had
been expended up to that time (December, 1890) for the benefit of the
Indians of the agency, and frequent complaints had been made to the
agent by the Indians because they had received no benefits from their
concessions to the said railroad companies.

(3) Failure of the government to issue the certificates of title to
allotments, as required by article 6 of the treaty of 1868.

(4) Failure of the government to provide the full allowance of seeds
and agricultural implements to Indians engaged in farming, as required
in article 8, treaty of 1868.

(5) Failure of the government to issue to such Indians the full number
of cows and oxen provided in article 10, treaty of 1876.

(7) Failure of the government to issue to the Indians the full ration
stipulated in article 5, treaty of 1876. (For the fiscal year beginning
July 1, 1890, the following shortages in the rations were found to
exist: 485,275 pounds of beef [gross], 761,212 pounds of corn, 11,937
pounds of coffee, 281,712 pounds of flour, 26,234 pounds of sugar, and
39,852 pounds of beans. Although the obligations of the government
extend no further than furnishing so much of the ration prescribed in
article 5 as may be necessary for the support of the Indians, it would
seem that, owing to the almost total failure of crops upon the Standing
Rock reservation for the past four years, and the absence of game, the
necessity for the issue of the full ration to the Indians here was
never greater than at the present time—December, 1890.)

(8) Failure of the government to issue to the Indians the full amount
of annuity supplies to which they were entitled under the provisions of
article 10, treaty of 1868.

(9) Failure of the government to have the clothing and other annuity
supplies ready for issue on the first day of August of each year. Such
supplies have not been ready for issue to the Indians, as a rule,
until the winter season is well advanced. (After careful examination
at this agency, the commanding officer is convinced that not more than
two-thirds of the supplies provided in article 10 have been issued
there, and the government has never complied with that provision of
article 10 which requires the supplies enumerated in paragraphs 2,
3, and 4 of said article to be delivered on or before the first day
of August of each year. Such supplies for the present fiscal year,
beginning July 1, 1890, had not yet reached (December, 1890) the
nearest railway station, about 60 miles distant, from which point
they must, at this season of the year, be freighted to this agency in
wagons. It is now certain that the winter will be well advanced before
the Indians at this agency receive their annual allowance of clothing
and other annuity supplies.)

(10) Failure of the government to appropriate money for the payment of
the Indians for the ponies taken from them, by the authority of the
government, in 1876.

In conclusion, the commanding officer says: “It, however, appears
from the foregoing, that the government has failed to fulfill its
obligations, and in order to render the Indians law-abiding, peaceful,
contented, and prosperous it is strongly recommended that the treaties
be promptly and fully carried out, and that the promises made by the
commission in 1889 be faithfully kept.”

  [_The reports from Pine Ridge, Rosebud, Cheyenne River, and Yankton
    agencies are of similar tenor. Following are two telegrams sent
    from the field by General Miles at the beginning of the trouble._]

                      +Rapid City, South Dakota+, _December 19, 1890_.

Senator +Dawes+,
      _Washington, District of Columbia_:

You may be assured of the following facts that can not be gainsaid:

First. The forcing process of attempting to make large bodies of
Indians self-sustaining when the government was cutting down their
rations and their crops almost a failure, is one cause of the
difficulty.

Second. While the Indians were urged and almost forced to sign a treaty
presented to them by the commission authorized by Congress, in which
they gave up a valuable portion of their reservation which is now
occupied by white people, the government has failed to fulfill its
part of the compact, and instead of an increase or even a reasonable
supply for their support, they have been compelled to live on half and
two-thirds rations, and received nothing for the surrender of their
lands, neither has the government given any positive assurance that
they intend to do any differently with them in the future.

Congress has been in session several weeks and could, if it were
disposed, in a few hours confirm the treaties that its commissioners
have made with these Indians and appropriate the necessary funds
for its fulfillment, and thereby give an earnest of their good faith
or intention to fulfill their part of the compact. Such action, in
my judgment, is essential to restore confidence with the Indians and
give peace and protection to the settlements. If this be done, and the
President authorized to place the turbulent and dangerous tribes of
Indians under the control of the military, Congress need not enter into
details, but can safely trust the military authorities to subjugate and
govern, and in the near future make self-sustaining, any or all of the
Indian tribes of this country.

                     +Rapid City, South Dakota+, _December 19, 1890_.


General +John M. Schofield+,
    _Commanding the Army, Washington, District of Columbia_:

Replying to your long telegram, one point is of vital importance—the
difficult Indian problem can not be solved permanently at this end
of the line. It requires the fulfillment by Congress of the treaty
obligations which the Indians were entreated and coerced into signing.
They signed away a valuable portion of their reservation, and it is
now occupied by white people, for which they have received nothing.
They understood that ample provision would be made for their support;
instead, their supplies have been reduced, and much of the time they
have been living on half and two-thirds rations. Their crops, as well
as the crops of the white people, for two years have been almost
a total failure. The disaffection is widespread, especially among
the Sioux, while the Cheyennes have been on the verge of starvation
and were forced to commit depredations to sustain life. These facts
are beyond question, and the evidence is positive and sustained by
thousands of witnesses. Serious difficulty has been gathering for
years. Congress has been in session several weeks and could in a single
hour confirm the treaties and appropriate the necessary funds for their
fulfillment, which their commissioners and the highest officials of the
government have guaranteed to these people, and unless the officers
of the army can give some positive assurance that the government
intends to act in good faith with these people, the loyal element will
be diminished and the hostile element increased. If the government
will give some positive assurance that it will fulfill its part of
the understanding with these 20,000 Sioux Indians, they can safely
trust the military authorities to subjugate, control, and govern these
turbulent people, and I hope that you will ask the Secretary of War and
the Chief Executive to bring this matter directly to the attention of
Congress.


                        REPORT OF CAPTAIN HURST

                     (_A. G. O. Doc. 6266—1891._)

                     +Fort Bennett, South Dakota+, _January 9, 1891_.

+Assistant Adjutant-General+,
    _Department of Dakota, Saint Paul, Minnesota_.

+Sir+: In compliance with instructions of the department commander—copy
attached marked A—I have the honor to submit the following report as
the result of my investigations into the matters referred to therein.

I have been at this post continuously since August 6, 1887, and
inspector of Indian supplies at the Cheyenne River Indian agency,
located here, during that period, and am at the present time.

The Indians of this agency have a standing list of grievances which
they present at every opportunity, and talk about in council when they
assemble at every monthly ration issue. The Indians most persistent in
recounting and proclaiming their grievances are those least willing to
help in bettering their condition, and who are opposed to any change or
improvement of their old habits and customs, and oppose all progress.
Of this class I cite Big Foot’s band of irreconcilables—who have now
ceased to complain—and those in accord with them. Except in the matter
of short rations, the story of their wrongs needs no attention. It
commences with a recital of the wrong done them by the white race
sharing the earth with them.

The other class, comprising a large majority of Indians of the
reservation, have accepted the situation forced upon them, and have
been for years bravely struggling in the effort to reconcile themselves
to the ways of civilization and moral progress, with a gratifying
degree of success. It is this class whose complaints and grievances
demand considerate attention. They complain in true Indian style that
they only have kept faith in all treaties made with them, and that
somehow the treaties when they appeared in print were not in many
respects the treaties which they signed.

They complain principally—

(1) That the boundaries of the reservation in the treaty of 1877 are
not what they agreed to and thought they were signing on the paper,
and they especially emphasize the point that the line of the western
boundary should be a _straight line_ at the Black Hills, instead of as
it appears on the maps.

(2) That they have never received full recompense for the ponies taken
from them in 1876.

(3) That the game has been destroyed and driven out of the country by
the white people.

(4) That their children are taken from them to eastern schools and kept
for years, instead of being educated among them.

(5) That when these eastern graduates return to them with civilized
habits, education, and trades, there is no provision made on the
reservation for their employment and improvement to the benefit of
themselves and their people.

(6) That the agents and employees sent out to them have not all been
“good men” and considerate of their (the Indians’) interests and
welfare.

(7) That the issue of their annuity goods is delayed so late in the
winter as to cause them much suffering.

(8) That they are expected to plow the land and raise grain when the
climate will not permit them to reap a crop. They think cattle should
be issued to them for breeding purposes instead of farming implements
for useless labor.

(9) That the rations issued to them are insufficient in quantity and
frequently (beef and flour) very poor in quality.

Complaints 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are all well founded and justified
by the facts in each case, No. 9 especially so, and this through no
fault or negligence of the agent. The agent makes his annual estimate
for sustenance in kind for the number of people borne on his rolls,
based on the stipulated ration in treaty of 1877. This estimate is
modified or cut down in the Indian Commissioner’s office to meet the
requirements of a limited or reduced Congressional appropriation, and
when it returns to the agent’s hands approved, he finds that he has
just so many pounds of beef and flour, etc, placed to his credit for
the year, without regard to whether they constitute the full number
of treaty rations or not. There is no allowance given him for loss
by shrinkage, wastage, or other unavoidable loss, and with the very
best efforts and care in the distribution throughout the year of this
usually reduced allowance there can not be issued to each Indian his
treaty ration nor enough to properly sustain life. As a general thing
the Indians of this reservation have been compelled to purchase food
according to their means, between ration issues. Those having no means
of purchase have suffered.

The half pound of flour called for by the treaty ration could not be
issued in full, and the half pound of corn required has never been
issued nor anything in lieu of it. In the item of beef but 1 pound was
issued instead of the pound and a half called for in the treaty, and
during the early spring months, when the cattle on the range are thin
and poor, the pound of beef issued to the Indian is but a fraction of
the pound issued to him on the agent’s returns, and, under the system
of purchase in practice until the present fiscal year, must necessarily
be so. The agent’s purchase of the beef supply on the hoof for the
year, under contract, is closed in the month of November, from which
time he has to herd them the balance of the year as best he can. He is
responsible for the weight they show on the scales when _fat and in
prime condition_, so that a steer weighing 1,200 pounds in the fall
must represent 1,200 pounds in April, while in fact it may be but
skin, horns, and bones, and weigh scarcely 600 pounds, while he has
done his best to care for them during the severity of a Dakota winter.
The Indians do not understand why they should be made to suffer all
this shrinkage and loss, and it is a useless and humiliating attempt to
explain. The agent is not to blame. The department of Indian affairs
can do only the best it can with a limited and tardy appropriation.
The remedy in the matter of food supply seems to be: A sufficient and
earlier appropriation of funds. All contracts for the beef supply
should call for delivery when required by the agent. The agent should
be allowed a percentage of wastage to cover unavoidable loss in issue
by shrinkage and wastage. The government should bear this loss and not
the Indians.

Complaint 1: No remarks.

Complaint 2: Is before Congress.

Complaint 4: Should be remedied by adequate home schools.

Complaint 5: Suggests its proper remedy.

Complaint 6: No remarks.

Complaint 7: Can be remedied only by earlier appropriations.

Complaint 8: This reservation is not agricultural land. The climate
makes it a grazing country. The Indians now can raise cattle
successfully and care for them in winter. All attempts at general
farming must result in failure on account of climatic conditions.

In connection with complaint 9, I respectfully invite attention to
tabular statement accompanying this report, marked B, showing rations
as issued up to December 6 in present fiscal year and amount required
to make the issues according to article 5, treaty of February 27, 1877,
and special attention to columns 6 and 7 therein.

Appended to this report, marked C, is an extract copy of treaties of
1877 and 1868.

In submitting this report, I desire to commend the administration
of the affairs of this agency, as it has appeared under my daily
observation since August, 1887. So far as this reservation is
concerned, the present unrest among the Indians is not attributable
to any just cause of complaint against the former or present agent or
employees; nor is it due entirely or largely to failure on the part of
the government to fulfill treaty obligations.


    Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
                                                   +J. H. Hurst+,
                        _Captain, Twelfth Infantry, Commanding Post_.


          APPENDIX C.—EXTRACT COPY—TREATIES OF 1877 AND 1868

                           +Treaty of 1877+

  +Article 3.+ The said Indians also agree that they will hereafter
  receive all annuities provided by the said treaty of 1868, and all
  subsistence and supplies which may be provided for them under the
  present or any future act of Congress, at such points and places on
  the said reservation and in the vicinity of the Missouri river as
  the President of the United States shall designate.

  +Article 5.+ In consideration of the foregoing cession of
  territory and rights, and upon full compliance with each and every
  obligation assumed by the said Indians, the United States agree to
  provide all necessary aid to assist the said Indians in the work
  of civilization; to furnish to them schools and instruction in
  mechanical and agricultural arts, as provided for by the treaty of
  1868. Also to provide the said Indians with subsistence consisting
  of a ration for each individual of a pound and a half of beef (or
  in lieu thereof, one-half pound of bacon), one-half pound of flour,
  and one-half pound of corn; and for every one hundred rations,
  four pounds of coffee, eight pounds of sugar, and three pounds of
  beans, or in lieu of said articles the equivalent thereof, in the
  discretion of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Such rations, or
  so much thereof as may be necessary, shall be continued until the
  Indians are able to support themselves. Rations shall in all cases
  be issued to the head of each separate family; and whenever schools
  shall have been provided by the government for said Indians, no
  rations shall be issued for children between the ages of six
  and fourteen years (the sick and infirm excepted), unless such
  children shall regularly attend school. Whenever the said Indians
  shall be located upon lands which are suitable for cultivation,
  rations shall be issued only to the persons and families of those
  persons who labor (the aged, sick, and infirm excepted); and as
  an incentive to industrious habits the Commissioner of Indian
  Affairs may provide that persons be furnished in payment for their
  labor such other necessary articles as are requisite for civilized
  life....

  +Article 8.+ The provisions of the said treaty of 1868, except as
  herein modified, shall continue in full force....


+Treaty of 1868+

+Article 8.+ When the head of a family or lodge shall have selected
lands in good faith and received a certificate therefor and commenced
farming in good faith, he is to receive not to exceed one hundred
dollars for the first year in seeds and agricultural implements, and
for a period of three years more not to exceed twenty-five dollars in
seeds and implements.

+Article 10.+ In lieu of all sums of money or other annuities provided
to be paid to the Indians herein named under any treaty or treaties
heretofore made, the United States agrees to deliver at the agency
house on the reservation herein named on (or before) the first day of
August of each year for thirty years, the following articles, to wit:

For each male person over fourteen years of age, a suit of good,
substantial woolen clothing, consisting of coat, pantaloons, flannel
shirt, hat, and a pair of home-made socks.

For each female over twelve years of age, a flannel skirt or the goods
necessary to make it, a pair of woolen hose, twelve yards of calico,
and twelve yards of cotton domestics.

For the boys and girls under the ages named, such flannel and cotton
goods as may be needed to make each a suit aforesaid, with a pair of
hose for each. And in addition to the clothing herein named, the sum of
ten dollars for each person entitled to the beneficial effects of this
treaty, shall be annually appropriated for a period of thirty years,
while such persons roam and hunt, and twenty dollars for each person
who engages in farming, to be used by the Secretary of the Interior in
the purchase of such articles as from time to time the condition and
necessities of the Indians may indicate to be proper. And if within
thirty years at any time it shall appear that the amount of money
needed for clothing, under this article, can be appropriated to better
uses for the Indians named herein, Congress may, by law, change the
appropriation to other purposes, but in no event shall the amount of
the appropriation be withdrawn or discontinued for the period named.

Article 10 further stipulates that each lodge or family who shall
commence farming shall receive within sixty days thereafter one good
American cow and one good well-broken pair of American oxen.

                      STATEMENT OF AMERICAN HORSE

  [_Delivered in council at Pine Ridge, agency to Agent Royer, and
    forwarded to the Indian Office, November 27, 1890. G. D. Doc.
    37002—1890._]

American Horse, Fast Thunder, Spotted Horse, Pretty Back, and Good
Lance present, with American Horse as spokesman:

“I think the late Sioux commissioners (General Crook, Major Warner,
and Governor Foster) had something to do with starting this trouble.
I was speaker for the whole tribe. In a general council I signed the
bill (the late Sioux bill) and 580 signed with me. The other members of
my band drew out and it divided us, and ever since these two parties
have been divided. The nonprogressive started the ghost dance to draw
from us. We were made many promises, but have never heard from them
since. The Great Father says if we do what he directs it will be to
our benefit; but instead of this they are every year cutting down our
rations, and we do not get enough to keep us from suffering. General
Crook talked nice to us; and after we signed the bill they took our
land and cut down our allowance of food. The commission made us believe
that we would get full sacks if we signed the bill, but instead of
that our sacks are empty. We lost considerable property by being here
with the commissioners last year, and have never got anything for it.
Our chickens were all stolen, our cattle some of them were killed,
our crops were entirely lost by us being absent here with the Sioux
commission, and we have never been benefited one bit by the bill; and,
in fact, we are worse off than we were before we signed the bill.
We are told if we do as white men we will be better off, but we are
getting worse off every year.”

“The commissioners promised the Indians living on Black Pipe and Pass
creeks that if they signed the bill they could remain where they were
and draw their rations at this agency, showing them on the map the
line, and our people want them here, but they have been ordered to
move back to Rosebud agency. This is one of the broken promises. The
commission promised to survey the boundary line, and appropriate $1,000
for the purpose, but it has not been done. When we were at Washington,
the President, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Commissioner all
promised us that we would get the million pounds of beef that were
taken from us, and I heard the bill appropriating the money passed
Congress, but we never got the beef. The Commissioner refused to give
it to us. American Horse, Fast Thunder, and Spotted Horse were all
promised a spring wagon each, but they have never heard anything of it.
This is another broken promise.”

In forwarding the report of the council, the agent says: “After
American Horse was through talking, I asked the other men present if
his statement voiced their sentiments and they all answered, Yes.”


                       STATEMENT OF BISHOP HARE

  [_Bishop W. H. Hare is the veteran Episcopal missionary bishop
    among the Sioux. The following extracts are from a communication
    by him to Secretary Noble, dated January 7, 1891. G. D. Doc.
    2440—1891._]

The evidence compels the conclusion that, among the Pine Ridge Indians
at least, _hunger has been an important element_ in the causes of
_discontent_ and _insubordination_. In the farming season of 1889
[July] the Indians were all called into the agency and kept there for a
month by the Sioux commission. During their absence their cattle broke
into their fields and trod down, or ate up, their crops. The Indians
reaped practically nothing. In the year 1890, drought, the worst known
for many years, afflicted the western part of South Dakota, and the
Indian crops were a total failure. There is ample evidence that, during
this period, the rations issued lasted, even when carefully used, for
only two-thirds the time for which they were intended. To add to their
distress, this period, 1889 and 1890, was marked by extraordinary
misfortune. The measles prevailed with great virulence in 1889, the
grippe in 1890. Whooping cough also attacked the children. The sick
died from want. In this statement Inspector Gardiner, Dr McGillycuddy,
late agent, Miss Elaine Goodale, who has been in the camps a good deal,
the missionary force, and many others whose testimony is of the highest
value because of their character and their knowledge of the situation,
all agree....

The time seemed now to have come to take a further step and divide the
Great Sioux reservation up into separate reserves for each important
tribe, and to open the surplus land to settlement. The needs of the
white population, with their business and railroads, and the welfare of
the Indians, seemed alike to demand this. Commissioners were therefore
sent out to treat with the people for the accomplishment of this end,
and an agreement which, after much debate, had won general approval
was committed to them for presentation to the Indians. The objections
of the Indians to the bill, however, were many and they were ardently
pressed. Some preferred their old life, the more earnestly because
schools and churches were sapping and undermining it. Some wished
delay. All complained that many of the engagements solemnly made with
them in former years when they had surrendered valued rights had been
broken, and here they were right. They suspected that present promises
of pay for their lands would prove only old ones in a new shape (when
milch cows were promised, cows having been promised in previous
agreements, the Indians exclaimed, “There’s that same old cow”), and
demanded that no further surrender should be expected until former
promises had been fulfilled. They were assured that a new era had
dawned, and that all past promises would be kept. So we all thought.
The benefits of the proposed agreement were set before them, and verbal
promises, over and above the stipulations of the bill, were made, that
special requests of the Indians would be met. The Indians have no
competent representative body. The commissioners had to treat at each
agency with a crowd, a crowd composed of full-bloods, half-breeds, and
squaw men, a crowd among whom all sorts of sinister influences and
brute force were at work. Commissioners with such a business in hand
have the devil to fight, and can fight him, so it often seems, only
with fire, and many friends of the Indians think that in this case the
commission, convinced that the acceptance of the bill was essential,
carried persuasion to the verge of intimidation. I do not blame them if
they sometimes did. The wit and patience of an angel would fail often
in such a task.

But the requisite number, three-fourths of the Indians, signed the
bill, and expectation of rich and prompt rewards ran high. The Indians
understand little of the complex forms and delays of our government.
Six months passed, and nothing came. Three months more, and nothing
came. A bill was drawn up in the Senate under General Crook’s eye
and passed, providing for the fulfillment of the promises of the
commission, but it was pigeon-holed in the House. But in the midst of
the winter’s pinching cold the Indians learned that the transaction
had been declared complete and half of their land proclaimed as thrown
open to the whites. Surveys were not promptly made; perhaps they could
not be, and no one knew what land was theirs and what was not. The
very earth seemed sliding from beneath their feet. Other misfortunes
seemed to be crowding on them. On some reserves their rations were
being reduced, and lasted, even when carefully husbanded, but one-half
the period for which they were issued. (The amount of beef _bought_
for the Indians is not a fair criterion of the amount he _receives_. A
steer will lose 200 pounds or more of its flesh during the course of
the winter.) In the summer of 1889 all the people on the Pine Ridge
reserve, men, women, and children, were called in from their farms to
the agency to treat with the commissioners and were kept there a whole
month, and, on returning to their homes, found that their cattle had
broken into their fields and trampled down or eaten up all their crops.
This was true in a degree elsewhere. In 1890 the crops, which promised
splendidly early in July, failed entirely later, because of a severe
drought. The people were often hungry, and, the physicians in many
cases said, died when taken sick, not so much from disease as for want
of food. (This is doubtless true of all the poor—the poor in our cities
and the poor settlers in the west.)

No doubt the people could have saved themselves from suffering if
industry, economy, and thrift had abounded; but these are just the
virtues which a people merging from barbarism lack. The measles
prevailed in 1889 and were exceedingly fatal. Next year the grippe
swept over the people with appalling results. Whooping cough followed
among the children. Sullenness and gloom began to gather, especially
among the heathen and wilder Indians. A witness of high character told
me that a marked discontent amounting almost to despair prevailed in
many quarters. The people said their children were all dying from
diseases brought by the whites, their race was perishing from the face
of the earth, and they might as well be killed at once. Old chiefs and
medicine men were losing their power. Withal new ways were prevailing
more and more which did not suit the older people. The old ways which
they loved were passing away. In a word, all things were against
them, and to add to the calamity, many Indians, especially the wilder
element, had nothing to do but to brood over their misfortunes. While
in this unhappy state, the story of a messiah coming, with its ghost
dance and strange hallucinations, spread among the heathen part of the
people....

But these things we do want. A profound conviction in the mind not
only of a few, but of the _people_, that the Indian problem is worth
attending to. Next, that the officials placed in charge of the
difficult Indian problem should be protected from the importunity of
hungry politicians, and that the employees in the Indian country,
agents, teachers, farmers, carpenters, should not be changed with every
shuffling of the political cards. The abuse here has been shameful.
Next, that Congress, especially the House of Representatives, shall
consider itself bound in honor to make provision for the fulfillment of
promises made to the Indians by commissioners duly appointed and sent
to the Indians by another branch of the government. The evils which
have arisen from a violation of this comity have been most serious.
Next, that testimony regarding Indian affairs should not be swallowed
until careful inquiry has been made as to the disinterestedness of the
witness. An honest man out here burns with indignation when he reads
in the papers that so and so, represented as being fully informed on
the whole question, affirms that Indians have no grievances and ought
to receive no quarter, when he knows that the lots which the witness
owns in a town near the Indian country would no longer be a drug in
the market if Indians could be gotten out of the way. Next, let it be
remembered that the crisis has lifted evils in the Indian country up to
the light, and left the good things in the shade. But the good things
are real and have shown their vigor under trial. There is no reason for
losing faith or courage. Let all kind and honest men unite with the
higher officials of the government, all of whom, I believe, mean well,
in a spirit of forbearance toward each other, of willingness to learn,
and of mutual helpfulness, to accomplish the results which they all
desire.




                            +Chapter XIII+

           THE SIOUX OUTBREAK—SITTING BULL AND WOUNDED KNEE

  We were made many promises, but have never heard from them
  since.—_American Horse._

  Congress has been in session several weeks and could, if it were
  disposed, in a few hours confirm the treaty that its commissioners
  have made with these Indians, and appropriate the necessary funds
  for their fulfillment, and thereby give an earnest of good faith or
  intention to fulfill their part of the compact. Such action in my
  judgment is essential to restore confidence with the Indians and
  give peace and protection to the settlements.—_General Miles._

  Approximate cost of outbreak in one month: Forty-nine whites and
  others on the government side, and three hundred Indians, killed;
  $1,200,000 expense to government and individuals.


Short Bull and the other Sioux delegates who had gone to see the
messiah in the fall of 1889 returned in March, 1890. Short Bull, on
Rosebud reservation, at once began to preach to his people the doctrine
and advent of the messiah, but desisted on being warned to stop by
Agent Wright. (_Comr., 29._) The strange hope had taken hold of the
Indians however, and the infection rapidly, although quietly, spread
among all the wilder portion of the tribe. The first warning of trouble
ahead came in the shape of a letter addressed to Secretary Noble by
Charles L. Hyde, a citizen of Pierre, South Dakota, under date of May
29, 1890, in which he stated that he had trustworthy information that
the Sioux, or a part of them, were secretly planning an outbreak in
the near future. His informant appears to have been a young half-blood
from Pine Ridge, who was at that time attending school in Pierre, and
was in correspondence with his Indian relatives at home. (_G. D.,
20._) The letter was referred to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
who forwarded a copy of it to the agents of the several western Sioux
reservations, with a request for further information. They promptly and
unanimously replied that there was no ground for apprehension, that the
Indians were peaceably disposed, and that there was no undue excitement
beyond that occasioned by the rumors of a messiah in the west. This
excitement they thought would continue to increase as the predicted
time drew near, and would die a natural death when the prophecy failed
of its fulfillment.

All the agents are positive in the opinion that at this time, about
the middle of June, 1890, the Indians had no hostile intentions.
McLaughlin, the veteran agent of Standing Rock, who probably knew
the Sioux better than any other white man having official relations
with them, states that among his people there was nothing in word or
action to justify such a suspicion, and that he did not believe such
an imprudent step was seriously contemplated by any of the tribe, and
concludes by saying that he has every confidence in the good intentions
of the Sioux as a people, that they would not be the aggressors in any
hostile act, and that if justice were only done them no uneasiness
need be entertained. He complains, however, of the evil influence
exercised by Sitting Bull and a few other malcontents attached to
his agency and advises their removal from among the Indians. Wright,
at Rosebud, also advised the removal of Crow Dog and some other
mischief-makers. These men had led the opposition to the late treaty
and to every advance of civilization, by which they felt their former
influence undermined, and between them and the progressive party there
was uncompromising hostility. (_G. D., 21._) Although the trouble did
come six months later, it is sufficiently evident that at this time
there was no outbreak intended. Certain it is that the Sioux as a
tribe—25,000 strong—did not engage in the outbreak, and in view of all
the circumstances it will hardly be claimed that they were deliberate
aggressors.

[Illustration: +Fig. 72+—A Sioux warrior—Weasel Bear.]

The first mutterings of dissatisfaction came from Pine Ridge. This is
the largest of the Sioux agencies, having 6,000 of the wildest and most
warlike of the tribe, largely under the influence of the celebrated
chief Red Cloud, the twin spirit of Sitting Bull in wily disposition
and hatred of the white man. It is the most remote from the white
settlements along Missouri river, and joins Rosebud reservation, with
4,000 more Sioux of about the same condition and temper, thus making a
compact body of 10,000 of the most warlike Indians of the plains. Above
all other reservations in the United States this was the very one where
there was most urgent and obvious necessity for efficient and vigorous
administration and for prompt and honest fulfillment of pledges.

From 1879 to 1886 this agency was in charge of Dr V. T. McGillycuddy,
a man of unflinching courage, determined will, and splendid executive
ability. Taking charge of these Indians when they had come in fresh
from the warpath, he managed them, as he himself says, for seven years
without the presence of a soldier on the reservation, and with none
nearer than 60 miles. Relying on the Indians themselves, he introduced
the principle of home rule by organizing a force of 50 Indian police,
drilled in regular cavalry and infantry tactics. With these he was able
to thwart all the mischievous schemes of Red Cloud, maintain authority,
and start the Indians well on the road to civilization.

Then came a political change of administration, with a resulting train
of changes all through the service. Out of 58 Indian agents more than
50 were removed and new men appointed. Some of these appointments were
for the better, but the general result was bad, owing mainly to the
inexperience of the new officials. In the meantime commissioners were
negotiating with the Sioux for a further cession of lands, which was
finally effected in spite of the opposition of a large part of the
tribe, especially of those under the influence of Red Cloud and Sitting
Bull at Pine Ridge and Standing Rock. Then rations were reduced and
the Indians began to suffer and, consequently, to be restless, their
unrest being intensified but not caused by the rumors of a messiah soon
to appear to restore the former conditions. According to the official
statement of General Brooke, the beef issue at Pine Ridge was reduced
from 8,125,000 pounds in 1886 to 4,000,000 pounds in 1889, a reduction
of more than one-half in three years. (_War, 5._) In April, 1890,
Gallagher, the agent then in charge, informed the Department that the
monthly beef issue was only 205,000 pounds, whereas the treaty called
for 470,400. He was informed that it was better to issue half rations
all the time than to issue three-fourths or full rations for two months
and none for the rest of the year. From other sources also the warning
now came to the Department that the Sioux of Pine Ridge were becoming
restless from hunger. (_G. D., 22._) Repeated representations failed to
bring more beef, and at last in the summer of 1890 the Indians at Pine
Ridge made the first actual demonstration by refusing to accept the
deficient issue and making threats against the agent. They were finally
persuaded to take the beef, but Agent Gallagher, finding that the
dissatisfaction was growing and apparently without remedy, resigned,
and his successor took charge in the beginning of October, 1890.

[Illustration: +Fig. 73+—Red Cloud.]

By this time the Ghost dance was in full progress among the western
Sioux and was rapidly spreading throughout the tribe. The principal
dance ground on Pine Ridge reservation was at No Water’s camp on White
Clay creek, about 20 miles from the agency. At a great Ghost dance
held here about the middle of June the ghost shirts were worn probably
for the first time. (_Comr., 30._) In August about 2,000 Indians had
assembled for a dance at the same rendezvous, when Agent Gallagher
sent out several police with orders to the dancers to quit and go
home. They refused to do so, and the agent himself went out with more
police to enforce the order. On repeating his demand a number of the
warriors leveled their guns toward him and the police, and told him
that they were ready to defend their religion with their lives. Under
the circumstances the agent, although known to be a brave man, deemed
it best to withdraw and the dance went on. (_Comr., 31; G. D., 23._)

On Rosebud reservation, which adjoins Pine Ridge on the east and is
occupied by the turbulent and warlike Brulés, the warning given to
Short Bull had such an effect that there was no open manifestation
until September, when the Ghost dance was inaugurated at the various
camps under the leadership of Short Bull the medicine-man, Crow Dog,
and Two Strike. Agent Wright, then in charge, went out to the Indians
and told them the dance must be stopped, which was accordingly done.
He expressly states that no violence was contemplated by the Indians,
and that no arms were carried in the dance, but that he forbade it on
account of its physical and mental effect on the participants and its
tendency to draw them from their homes. In some way a rumor got among
the Indians at this time that troops had arrived on the reservation
to attack them, and in an incredibly short time every Indian had left
the neighborhood of the agency and was making preparations to meet
the enemy. It was with some difficulty that Agent Wright was able to
convince them that the report was false and persuade them to return to
their homes. Soon afterward circumstances obliged him to be temporarily
absent, leaving affairs in the meantime in charge of a special agent.
The Indians took advantage of his absence to renew the Ghost dance
and soon defied control. The agent states, however, that no Indians
left the agency until the arrival of the troops, when the leaders
immediately departed for Pine Ridge, together with 1,800 of their
followers. (_G. D., 24; Comr., 32._)

On October 9 Kicking Bear of Cheyenne River agency, the chief high
priest of the Ghost dance among the Sioux, went to Standing Rock
by invitation of Sitting Bull and inaugurated the dance on that
reservation at Sitting Bull’s camp on Grand river. The dance had
begun on Cheyenne river about the middle of September, chiefly at the
camps of Hump and Big Foot. On learning of Kicking Bear’s arrival,
Agent McLaughlin sent a force of police, including two officers, to
arrest him and put him off the reservation, but they returned without
executing the order, both officers being in a dazed condition and
fearing the power of Kicking Bear’s “medicine.” Sitting Bull, however,
had promised that his visitors would go back to their own reservation,
which they did a day or two later, but he declared his intention to
continue the dance, as they had received a direct message from the
spirit world through Kicking Bear that they must do so to live. He
promised that he would suspend the dance until he could come and talk
the matter over with the agent, but this promise he failed to keep.
Considering Sitting Bull the leader and instigator of the excitement
on the reservation, McLaughlin again advised his removal, and that of
several other mischief makers, and their confinement in some military
prison at a distance. (_G. D., 25._)

The two centers of excitement were now at Standing Rock reservation,
where Sitting Bull was the open and declared leader, and at Pine Ridge,
where Red Cloud was a firm believer in the new doctrine, although
perhaps not an instigator of direct opposition to authority. At Rosebud
the movement had been smothered for the time by the prompt action of
Agent Wright, as already described. At the first-named reservation
McLaughlin met the emergency with bravery and ability reinforced
by twenty years of experience in dealing with Indians, and, while
recommending the removal of Sitting Bull, expressed confidence in
his own ability to allay the excitement and suppress the dance. At
Pine Ridge, however, where the crisis demanded a man of most positive
character—somebody of the McGillycuddy stamp—Gallagher had resigned and
had been succeeded in October by D. F. Royer, a person described as
“destitute of any of those qualities by which he could justly lay claim
to the position—experience, force of character, courage, and sound
judgment.” (_Welsh, 2._) This appears in every letter and telegram
sent out by him during his short incumbency, and is sufficiently
evidenced in the name by which the Sioux soon came to know him,
Lakota-Kokipa-Koshkala, “Young-man-afraid-of-Indians.” Before he had
been in charge a week, he had so far lost control of his Indians as to
allow a half dozen of them to release and carry off a prisoner named
Little, whom the police had arrested and brought to the agency. On
October 12 he reported that more than half of his 6,000 Indians were
dancing, and that they were entirely beyond the control of the police,
and suggested that it would be necessary to call out the military. (_G.
D., 26._)

About the same time Agent Palmer at Cheyenne River reported to the
Department that Big Foot’s band (afterward engaged at Wounded Knee)
was very much excited over the coming of the messiah, and could not be
kept by the police from dancing. In reply, both agents were instructed
to use every prudent measure to stop the dance and were told that
military assistance would be furnished if immediate need should arise.
(_L. B., 1._) Instructions were also sent to agents in Nevada to warn
the leaders of the dance in that quarter to desist. A few days later
the agent at Cheyenne River had a talk with the dancers, and so far
convinced them of the falsity of their hopes that he was able to report
that the excitement was dying out, but recommended the removal of Hump,
as a leader of the disaffection. (_G. D., 27._)

By the advice of the Department, Royer had consulted General Miles,
at that time passing on his way to the west, as to the necessity for
troops, and, after hearing a full statement, the general expressed
the opinion that the excitement would die out of itself. The next day
the general had a talk with the Indians, who informed him that they
intended to continue the dance. He gave them some good advice and
told them that they must stop. Had the matter rested here until the
words of the commanding officer could have been deliberated in their
minds—for the mental process of an Indian can not well be hurried—all
might have been well. Unfortunately, however, the agent, now thoroughly
frightened, wrote a long letter to the Department on October 30,
stating that the only remedy for the matter was the use of military,
and that about 600 or 700 troops would be necessary. On November 11 he
telegraphed for permission to come to Washington to “explain,” and was
refused. Then came other telegraphic requests, at the rate of one every
day, for the same permission, all of which were refused, with pointed
intimation that the interests of the service required that the agent
should remain at his post of duty. Finally the matter was reported by
the Indian Office to the War Department, and on November 15 Royer was
instructed to report the condition of affairs to the commander of the
nearest military post, Port Robinson, Nebraska. On the same day he had
telegraphed that the Indians were wild and crazy and that at least a
thousand soldiers were needed. The agent at Rosebud also now reported
that his Indians were beyond control by the police. Special agents were
sent to both agencies and confirmed the reports as to the alarming
condition of affairs. The agent at Crow Creek and Lower Brulé agency
reported at the same time that his Indians were under good control and
that the police were sufficient for all purposes. (_G. D., 28; L. B.,
2._)

On the last day of October, Short Bull, one of those who had been to
see the messiah, made an address to a large gathering of Indians near
Pine Ridge, in which he said that as the whites were interfering so
much in the religious affairs of the Indians he would advance the time
for the great change and make it nearer, even within the next month.
He urged them all to gather in one place and prepare for the coming
messiah, and told them they must dance even though troops should
surround them, as the guns of the soldiers would be rendered harmless
and the white race itself would soon be annihilated. (See his speech,
page 788.)

Soon afterward, McLaughlin personally visited Sitting Bull at his
camp on Grand river and attempted to reason with the Indians on the
absurdity of their belief. In reply, Sitting Bull proposed that they
should both go with competent attendants to the country of the messiah
and see and question him for themselves, and rest the truth or falsity
of the new doctrine on the result. The proposition was not accepted.
(_G. D., 29._) There can be no question that the leaders of the Ghost
dance among the Sioux were fully as much deceived as their followers.

As the local agents had declared the situation beyond their control,
the War Department was at last called on and responded. On November 13
the President had directed the Secretary of War to assume a military
responsibility to prevent an outbreak (_G. D., 30_), and on November
17 troops, under command of General John R. Brooke, were ordered to
the front. The general plan of the campaign was under the direction
of General Nelson A. Miles, in command of the military department of
the Missouri. On November 19 the first troops arrived at Pine Ridge
from Fort Robinson, Nebraska, and were speedily reinforced by others.
Within a few days there were at Pine Ridge agency, under immediate
command of General Brooke, eight troops of the Seventh cavalry,
under Colonel Forsyth; a battalion of the Ninth cavalry (colored),
under Major Henry; a battalion of the Fifth artillery, under Captain
Capron, and a company of the Eighth infantry and eight companies of
the Second infantry, under Colonel Wheaton. At Rosebud were two troops
of the Ninth cavalry, with portions of the Eighth and Twenty-first
infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Poland. Between Rosebud and Pine
Ridge were stationed seven companies of the First infantry, under
Colonel Shafter. West and north of Pine Ridge were stationed portions
of the First, Second, and Ninth cavalry, under command of Colonel
Tilford and Lieutenant-Colonel Sanford. Farther west, at Buffalo Gap,
on the railroad, were stationed three troops from the Fifth and Eighth
cavalry, under Captain Wells. Farther north on the railroad, at Rapid
City, was Colonel Carr with six troops of the Sixth cavalry. Along the
south fork of Cheyenne river Lieutenant-Colonel Offley took position
with seven companies of the Seventeenth infantry, and east of him was
stationed Lieutenant-Colonel Sumner with three troops of the Eighth
cavalry, two companies of the Third infantry, and Lieutenant Robinson’s
company of Crow Indian scouts. Small garrisons were also stationed
at Forts Meade, Bennett, and Sully. Most of the force was placed in
position between the Indians now gathering in the Bad Lands, under
Short Bull and Kicking Bear, and the scattered settlements nearest
them. Seven companies of the Seventh infantry, under Colonel Merriam,
were also placed along Cheyenne river to restrain the Indians of
Cheyenne River and Standing Rock reservations. In a short time there
were nearly 3,000 troops in the field in the Sioux country. General
Miles established his headquarters at Rapid City, South Dakota, close
to the center of disturbance. (_War, 6._) On December 1 the Secretary
of the Interior directed that the agents be instructed to obey and
cooperate with the military officers in all matters looking to the
suppression of an outbreak. (_G. D., 31._)

         From Report of the SECRETARY OF WAR for 1891, Vol. 1.
]

Upon the first appearance of the troops a large number of Indians of
Rosebud and Pine Ridge, led by Short Bull, Kicking Bear, and others,
left their homes and fled to the rough broken country known as the
Bad Lands, northwest of White river in South Dakota, on the edge
of Pine Ridge reservation and about 50 miles northwest of the agency.
In their flight they destroyed the houses and other property of the
friendly Indians in their path and compelled many to go with them.
They succeeded also in capturing a large portion of the agency beef
herd. Others rapidly joined them until soon a formidable body of 3,000
Indians had gathered in the Bad Lands, where, protected by the natural
fastnesses and difficulties of the country, their future intentions
became a matter of anxious concern to the settlers and the authorities.

[Illustration: +Fig. 74+—Short Bull.]

From the concurrent testimony of all the witnesses, including Indian
Commissioner Morgan and the Indians themselves, this flight to the
Bad Lands was not properly a hostile movement, but was a stampede
caused by panic at the appearance of the troops. In his official report
Commissioner Morgan says:

  When the troops reached Rosebud, about 1,800 Indians—men, women,
  and children—stampeded toward Pine Ridge and the Bad Lands,
  destroying their own property before leaving and that of others en
  route.

After the death of Sitting Bull he says:

  Groups of Indians from the different reservations had commenced
  concentrating in the Bad Lands, upon or in the vicinity of the
  Pine Ridge reservation. Killing of cattle and destruction of other
  property by these Indians, almost entirely within the limits of
  Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations, occurred, but no signal fires
  were built, no warlike demonstrations were made, no violence
  was done to any white settlers, nor was there any cohesion or
  organization among the Indians themselves. Many of them were
  friendly Indians who had never participated in the ghost dance,
  but had fled thither from fear of soldiers, in consequence of the
  Sitting Bull affair or through the overpersuasion of friends. The
  military gradually began to close in around them and they offered
  no resistance, and a speedy and quiet capitulation of all was
  confidently expected. (_Comr., 33._)

The Sioux nation numbers over 25,000, with between 6,000 and 7,000
warriors. Hardly more than 700 warriors were concerned altogether,
including those of Big Foot’s band and those who fled to the Bad Lands.
None of the Christian Indians took any part in the disturbance.

While it is certain that the movement toward the Bad Lands with the
subsequent events were the result of panic at the appearance of the
troops, it is equally true that the troops were sent only on the
request of the civilian authorities. On this point General Miles
says: “Not until the civil agents had lost control of the Indians
and declared themselves powerless to preserve peace, and the Indians
were in armed hostility and defiance of the civil authorities, was a
single soldier moved from his garrison to suppress the general revolt.”
(_War, 7._) Throughout the whole trouble McGillycuddy at Standing Rock
consistently declared his ability to control his Indians without the
presence of troops.

In accord with instructions from the Indian Office, the several agents
in charge among the Sioux had forwarded lists of disturbers whom it
would be advisable to arrest and remove from among the Indians, using
the military for the purpose if necessary. The agents at the other
reservations sent in all together the names of about fifteen subjects
for removal, while Royer, at Pine Ridge, forwarded as a “conservative
estimate” the names of sixty-four. Short Bull and Kicking Bear being
in the Bad Lands, and Red Cloud being now an old man and too politic
to make much open demonstration, the head and front of the offenders
was Sitting Bull, the irreconcilable; but McLaughlin, within whose
jurisdiction he was, in a letter of November 22, advised that the
arrest be not attempted until later in the season, as at the date of
writing the weather was warm and pleasant—in other words, favorable to
the Indians in case they should make opposition. (_G. D., 32._) The
worst element had withdrawn to the Bad Lands, where they were making
no hostile demonstrations, but were apparently badly frightened and
awaiting developments to know whether to come in and surrender or to
continue to retreat. The dance had generally been discontinued on the
reservations, excepting at Sitting Bull’s camp on Grand river and Big
Foot’s camp on Cheyenne river. The presence of troops had stopped the
dances near the agencies, and the Secretary of the Interior, in order
to allay the dissatisfaction, had ordered that the full rations due
under the treaty should be issued at all the Sioux agencies, which at
the same time were placed under the control of the military. (_G. D.,
33; L. B., 3._) Such were the conditions on the opening of December,
1890. Everything seemed to be quieting down, and it was now deemed
a favorable time to forestall future disturbance by removing the
ringleaders.

[Illustration: +Fig. 75+—Kicking Bear.]

Agent McLaughlin at Standing Rock had notified the Department some
weeks before that it would be necessary to remove Sitting Bull and
several others at no distant day to put an end to their harmful
influence among the Sioux, but stated also that the matter should not
be precipitated, and that when the proper time came he could accomplish
the undertaking with his Indian police without the aid of troops. As
soon as the War Department assumed control of the Sioux agencies, it
was determined to make an attempt to secure Sitting Bull by military
power. Accordingly, orders were given to the noted scout, William
F. Cody, better known as Buffalo Bill, who was well acquainted with
Sitting Bull and was believed to have influence with him, to proceed
to Standing Rock agency to induce him to come in, with authority to
make such terms as might seem necessary, and, if unsuccessful, to
arrest him and remove him from his camp to the nearest post, Fort
Yates. Cody arrived at Fort Yates on November 28, and was about to
undertake the arrest, when his orders were countermanded at the urgent
remonstrance of Agent McLaughlin, who represented that such a step at
that particular time was unwise, as military interference was liable
to provoke a conflict, in which the Indians would have the advantage,
as the warm weather was in their favor. He insisted that there was no
immediate danger from the dancing, and that at the proper time—when
the weather grew colder—he could take care of Sitting Bull and the
other disturbers whose removal he advised with the aid of the Indian
police, whom, in all his years of service, he had always found equal to
the emergency. The attempt was accordingly postponed. In the meantime
Sitting Bull had promised to come into the agency to talk over the
situation with the agent, but failed to keep his engagement. A close
watch was kept over his movements and the agent was instructed to make
no arrests except by authority from the military or the Secretary of
the Interior. (_G. D., 34._)

There is no question that Sitting Bull was plotting mischief. His
previous record was one of irreconcilable hostility to the government,
and in every disturbance on the reservation his camp had been the
center of ferment. It was at his camp and on his invitation that
Kicking Bear had organized the first Ghost dance on the reservation,
and the dance had been kept up by Sitting Bull ever since in spite of
the repeated remonstrance of the agent. At the same time the turbulent
followers of the medicine-man took every opportunity to insult and
annoy the peaceable and progressive Indians who refused to join them
until these latter were forced to make complaint to the agent. In
October, while the dance was being organized at his camp, Sitting Bull
had deliberately broken the “pipe of peace” which he had kept in his
house since his surrender in 1881, and when asked why he had broken
it, replied that he wanted to die and wanted to fight. From that time
he discontinued his regular visits to the agency. It became known that
he contemplated leaving the reservation to visit the other leaders of
dissatisfaction at the southern Sioux agencies, and to frustrate such
an attempt the agent had gradually increased the number of police in
the neighborhood of his camp, and had arranged for speedy information
and prompt action in case of any sudden move on his part. (_G. D., 35._)

[Illustration: PL. XCVI

  STANDING ROCK AGENCY AND VICINITY]

Foreseeing from the active movements of the military that the arrest
of Sitting Bull was liable to be ordered at any moment, and fearing
that such action might come at an inopportune time, and thus result in
trouble, McLaughlin made arrangements to have him and several other
disturbers arrested by the Indian police on the night of December 6,
the weather and other things being then, in his opinion, most favorable
for the attempt. On telegraphing to the Indian department, however, for
authority, he was directed to make no arrests excepting upon order from
the military authorities or the Secretary of the Interior. In reply
to a telegram from General Ruger, McLaughlin stated that there was no
immediate need of haste, and that postponement was preferable, as the
winter weather was cooling the ardor of the dancers.

On December 12 the military order came for the arrest of Sitting Bull.
Colonel Drum, in command at Fort Yates, was directed to make it his
personal duty to secure him and to call on the agent for assistance and
cooperation in the matter. On consultation between the commandant and
the agent, who were in full accord, it was decided to make the arrest
on the 20th, when most of the Indians would be down at the agency for
rations, and there would consequently be less danger of a conflict at
the camp. On the 14th, however, late Sunday afternoon, a courier came
from Grand river with a message from Mr Carignan, the teacher of the
Indian school, stating, on information given by the police, that an
invitation had just come from Pine Ridge to Sitting Bull asking him
to go there, as God was about to appear. Sitting Bull was determined
to go, and sent a request to the agent for permission, but in the
meantime had completed his preparations to go anyhow in case permission
was refused. With this intention it was further stated that he had
his horses already selected for a long and hard ride, and the police
urgently asked to be allowed to arrest him at once, as it would be a
difficult matter to overtake him after he had once started.

It was necessary to act immediately, and arrangements were made between
Colonel Drum and Agent McLaughlin to attempt the arrest at daylight
the next morning, December 15. The arrest was to be made by the Indian
police, assisted, if necessary, by a detachment of troops, who were
to follow within supporting distance. There were already twenty-eight
police under command of Lieutenant Bull Head in the immediate vicinity
of Sitting Bull’s camp on Grand river, about 40 miles southwest of
the agency and Fort Yates, and couriers were at once dispatched to
these and to others in that direction to concentrate at Sitting Bull’s
house, ready to make the arrest in the morning. It was then sundown,
but with loyal promptness the police mounted their ponies and by
riding all night from one station to another assembled a force of 43
trained and determined Indian police, including four volunteers, at the
rendezvous on Grand river before daylight. In performing this courier
service Sergeant Red Tomahawk covered the distance of 40 miles between
the agency and the camp, over an unfamiliar road, in four hours and a
quarter; and another, Hawk Man, made 100 miles, by a roundabout way,
in twenty-two hours. In the meantime two troops of the Eighth cavalry,
numbering 100 men, under command of Captain E. G. Fechét, and having
with them a Hotchkiss gun, left Fort Yates at midnight, guided by Louis
Primeau, and by a rapid night march arrived within supporting distance
near Sitting Bull’s camp just before daybreak. It was afterward learned
that Sitting Bull, in anticipation of such action, had had a strong
guard about his house for his protection for several nights previous,
but on this particular night the Indians had been dancing until nearly
morning, and the house was consequently left unguarded.

[Illustration: +Fig. 76+—Red Tomahawk.]

At daybreak on Monday morning, December 15, 1890, the police and
volunteers, 43 in number, under command of Lieutenant Bull Head, a
cool and reliable man, surrounded Sitting Bull’s house. He had two
log cabins, a few rods apart, and to make sure of their man, eight of
the police entered one house and ten went into the other, while the
rest remained on guard outside. They found him asleep on the floor
in the larger house. He was aroused and told that he was a prisoner
and must go to the agency. He made no objection, but said “All right;
I will dress and go with you.” He then sent one of his wives to the
other house for some clothes he desired to wear, and asked to have his
favorite horse saddled for him to ride, which was done by one of the
police. On looking about the room two rifles and several knives were
found and taken by the police. While dressing, he apparently changed
his mind and began abusing the police for disturbing him, to which
they made no reply. While this was going on inside, his followers, to
the number of perhaps 150, were congregating about the house outside
and by the time he was dressed an excited crowd of Indians had the
police entirely surrounded and were pressing them to the wall. On being
brought out, Sitting Bull became greatly excited and refused to go,
and called on his followers to rescue him. Lieutenant Bull Head and
Sergeant Shave Head were standing on each side of him, with Second
Sergeant Red Tomahawk guarding behind, while the rest of the police
were trying to clear the way in front, when one of Sitting Bull’s
followers, Catch-the-Bear, fired and shot Lieutenant Bull Head in the
side. Bull Head at once turned and sent a bullet into the body of
Sitting Bull, who was also shot through the head at the same moment by
Red Tomahawk. Sergeant Shave Head was shot by another of the crowd, and
fell to the ground with Bull Head and Sitting Bull. Catch-the-Bear, who
fired the first shot, was immediately shot and killed by Alone Man,
one of the police, and it became a desperate hand-to-hand fight of
less than 43 men against more than a hundred. The trained police soon
drove their assailants into the timber near by, and then returned and
carried their dead and wounded into the house and held it for about two
hours, until the arrival of the troops under Captain Fechét, about half
past seven. The troops had been notified of the perilous situation of
the police by Hawk Man, who had volunteered to carry the information
from Sitting Bull’s camp. He succeeded in getting away, assisted by
Red Tomahawk, although so closely pursued that several bullets passed
through his clothing. In spite of the efforts of the hostiles, the
police also held possession of the corral, which Sitting Bull had
filled with horses in anticipation of his flight. When the cavalry
came in sight over a hill, about 1,500 yards distant from the camp,
the police at the corral raised a white flag to show where they were,
but the troops, mistaking them for hostiles, fired two shells at them
from the Hotchkiss, when Sergeant Red Tomahawk, who had taken command
after the wounding of his superior officers, paraded his men in line
and then rode out alone with a white flag to meet the troops. On the
approach of the soldiers Sitting Bull’s warriors fled up Grand river a
short distance and then turned south across the prairie toward Cherry
creek and Cheyenne river. Not wishing to create such a panic among them
as to drive them into the hostile camp in the Bad Lands, Captain Fechét
pursued them only a short distance and then left them to be handled
by the other detachments in that direction. Their wives and families,
their property and their dead, were left behind in the flight. As soon
as possible Captain Fechét also sent word to them by some Indian women
to return to their homes and they would not be molested. To further
reassure them, the troops at once began their march back to the post.
As a result of this sensible policy, very few of the Sitting Bull band
joined the hostiles. They had made no resistance to the troops, but
fled immediately on their appearance.

[Illustration: +Fig. 77+—Sitting Bull the Sioux medicine-man.]

The fight lasted only a few minutes, but with terribly fatal result.
Six policemen were killed or mortally wounded, including the officers
Bull Head and Shave Head, and one other less seriously wounded. The
hostiles lost eight killed, including Sitting Bull and his son Crow
Foot, 17 years of age, with several wounded. During the fight the women
attacked the police with knives and clubs, but notwithstanding the
excitement the police simply disarmed them and put them in one of the
houses under guard.

[Illustration: +Fig. 78+—Sketch of the country where fight took place
  between Sitting Bull’s Indians and the government police, December
  15, 1890.]

The warmest praise is given the Indian police for their conduct on this
occasion by those who are most competent to judge. Some who thus faced
death in obedience to orders had near relatives among those opposed to
them. Agent McLaughlin in one official letter says that he can not too
strongly commend their splendid courage and ability in the action, and
in another letter says: “The details of the battle show that the Indian
police behaved nobly and exhibited the best of judgment and bravery,
and a recognition by the government for their services on this occasion
is richly deserved.... I respectfully urge that the Interior Department
cooperate with the War Department in obtaining Congressional action
which will secure to these brave survivors and to the families of the
dead a full and generous reward.” Colonel Drum, under whose orders the
arrest was made, after stating that Sitting Bull was not hurt until he
began struggling to escape and until one of the police had been shot,
adds: “It is also remarkable that no squaws or children were hurt. The
police appear to have constantly warned the other Indians to keep away,
until they were forced to fight in self-defense. It is hardly possible
to praise their conduct too highly.” Notwithstanding the recommendation
of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Congress has taken no action in
recognition of their services on this occasion.

Before the action orders had been sent to the police to have with them
a wagon, in order to convey Sitting Bull quickly away from the camp,
so as to avoid trouble, but in the excitement of preparation this was
overlooked. The police returned to the agency late in the afternoon,
bringing with them their dead and wounded, together with two prisoners
and the body of Sitting Bull, which was turned over to the military
authorities at Fort Yates. The four dead policemen were buried at
the agency next day with military honors. Bull Head and Shave Head
died in the hospital soon afterward, with the consolation of having
their friends around them in their last moments. The agent states
that the large majority of the Indians were loyal to the government,
and expressed satisfaction at what they considered the termination of
the disturbance. Couriers were again sent after the fleeing Indians
by McLaughlin, warning them to return to the agency, where they would
be safe, or suffer the consequences if found outside the reservation.
Within a few days nearly 250 had come in and surrendered, leaving only
about one-third still out. Most of these soon afterward surrendered
with Hump on Cherry creek, while the remainder, about 50, joined Big
Foot or went on to Pine Ridge. (_G. D., 36; War, 8._)

Thus died Tata′nka I′yota′nke, Sitting Bull, the great medicine-man of
the Sioux, on the morning of December 15, 1890, aged about 56 years.
He belonged to the Uncpapa division of the Teton Sioux. Although a
priest rather than a chief, he had gained a reputation in his early
years by organizing and leading war parties, and became prominent by
his participation in the battle of Little Bighorn, in Montana, on
June 25, 1876, by which Custer’s command was wiped out of existence.
Being pursued by General Terry, Sitting Bull and his band made their
escape northward into Canada, where they remained until 1881, when he
surrendered, through the mediation of the Canadian authorities, on a
promise of pardon. To obtain subsistence while in Canada, his people
had been obliged to sell almost all they possessed, including their
firearms, so that they returned to their old homes in an impoverished
condition. After confinement as a prisoner of war until 1883, Sitting
Bull took up his residence on Grand river, where he remained until he
met his death. Here he continued to be the leader of the opposition to
civilization and the white man, and his camp became the rallying point
for the dissatisfied conservative element that clung to the old order
of things, and felt that innovation meant destruction to their race.
For seven years he had steadily opposed the treaty by which the great
Sioux reservation was at last broken up in 1889. After the treaty had
been signed by the requisite number to make it a law, he was asked by a
white man what the Indians thought about it. With a burst of passionate
indignation he replied, “Indians! There are no Indians left now but
me.” However misguided he may have been in thus continuing a losing
fight against the inevitable, it is possible that from the Indian point
of view he may have been their patriot as he was their high priest.
He has been mercilessly denounced as a bad man and a liar; but there
can be no doubt that he was honest in his hatred of the whites, and
his breaking of the peace pipe, saying that he “wanted to fight and
wanted to die,” showed that he was no coward. But he represented the
past. His influence was incompatible with progress, and his death marks
an era in the civilization of the Sioux. In the language of General
Miles, “His tragic fate was but the ending of a tragic life. Since the
days of Pontiac, Tecumseh, and Red Jacket no Indian has had the power
of drawing to him so large a following of his race and molding and
wielding it against the authority of the United States, or of inspiring
it with greater animosity against the white race and civilization.”
(_War, 9._)

On December 18 the Indians who had already fled to the Bad Lands
attacked a small party of men on Spring creek of Cheyenne river. Major
Tupper with 100 men of Carr’s division was sent to their rescue, and
a skirmish ensued with the Indians, who were concealed in the bushes
along the creek. The government wagons, while crossing the creek,
were also attacked by the hostiles, who were finally driven off by
reinforcements of cavalry under Captain Wells. On the same date over
a thousand Indians returned to Pine Ridge. News was received that
there were still about 1,500 fugitives camped on Cheyenne river in the
neighborhood of Spring creek. (_Colby, 1._)

The most dangerous leader of dissatisfaction in the north after the
death of Sitting Bull was considered to be Hump, on Cheyenne River
reservation. The agent in charge had long before recommended his
removal, but it was thought that it would now be next to impossible
to arrest him. Hump with his band of about 400 persons, and Big Foot
with nearly as many, had their camps about the junction of Cherry
creek and Cheyenne river. For several weeks they had been dancing
almost constantly, and were very sullen and apparently very hostile.
After serious consideration of the matter, the task of securing Hump
was assigned to Captain E. P. Ewers of the Fifth infantry, who had had
charge of this chief and his band for seven years and had their full
confidence and respect. He was then on duty in Texas, but was ordered
forward and reported soon after at Fort Bennett on the border of the
reservation. So dangerous was Hump considered to be that the civil
agents did not think it possible even for the officer to communicate
with him. However, Captain Ewers, without troops and attended only by
Lieutenant Hale, at once left the fort and rode out 60 miles to Hump’s
camp. “Hump at the time was 20 miles away and a runner was sent for
him. Immediately upon hearing that Captain Ewers was in the vicinity
he came to him and was told that the division commander desired him to
take his people away from the hostiles and bring them to the nearest
military post. He replied that if General Miles sent for him, he would
do whatever he desired. He immediately brought his people into Fort
Bennett and complied with all the orders and instructions given him,
and subsequently rendered valuable service for peace. Thus an element
regarded as among the most dangerous was removed.” After coming into
the fort, Hump enlisted as a scout under Captain Ewers, and soon
afterward, in connection with the same Lieutenant Hale, proved his
loyalty by bringing about the surrender of the Sitting Bull fugitives.
Subsequently Captain Ewers further distinguished himself by conducting
the northern Cheyenne—who were considered as particularly dangerous,
but who regarded Captain Ewers with absolute affection—from Pine Ridge
to Tongue river, Montana, a distance of 300 miles, and in the most
rigorous of the winter season, without an escort of troops and without
the loss of a single life or the commission by an Indian of a single
unlawful act. (_War, 10._)

The Sitting Bull fugitives who had not come in at once had fled
southward toward their friends and near relatives of Cheyenne River
reservation, and were camped on Cherry creek a few miles above its
junction with Cheyenne river at Cheyenne City. As their presence there
could serve only to increase the unrest among the other Indians in
that vicinity, and as there was great danger that they might attempt
to join those already in the Bad Lands, Captain Hurst, of the Twelfth
infantry, commanding at Fort Bennett, directed Lieutenant H. E. Hale
on December 18 to go out and bring them in. On arriving at Cheyenne
City the officer found it deserted, all the citizens excepting one man
having fled in alarm a short time before on the report of a half-blood
that the Sitting Bull Indians were coming and had sworn to kill the
first white man they met. Having succeeded in frightening the whole
population, the half-blood himself, Narcisse Narcelle, left at once for
the fort.

After some difficulty in finding anyone to assist him, Hale sent a
policeman to bring back Narcelle and sent out another Indian to learn
the situation and condition of the Indian camp. His only interpreter
for the purpose was Mr Angell, the single white man who had remained,
and who had learned some of the Sioux language during his residence
among them. While thus waiting, a report came that the Indians had
raided a ranch about 10 miles up the creek. Not hearing from his
scouts, the lieutenant determined to go alone and find the camp, and
was just about to start, when Hump, the late dangerous hostile, but now
an enlisted scout, rode in with the news that the Sitting Bull Indians
were approaching only a short distance away, and armed. Although from
the reports there was every reason to believe that they had just
destroyed a ranch and were now coming to attack the town, the officer,
with rare bravery, kept his determination to go out and meet them,
even without an interpreter, in the hope of preventing their hostile
purpose. Hump volunteered to go with him. The two rode out together and
soon came up with the Indians, who received them in a friendly manner.
There were 46 warriors in the party, besides women and children,
wagons and ponies. Says the officer: “I appreciated the importance of
the situation, but was absolutely powerless to communicate with the
Indians. I immediately formed the opinion that they could be easily
persuaded to come into the agency if I could but talk with them.
While I was trying by signs to make them understand what I wanted,
Henry Angell rode into the circle and took his place at my side. This
generous man had not liked the idea of my going among these Indians,
and from a true spirit of chivalry had ridden over to ‘see it out.’”
Verily, while such men as Ewers, Hale, and Angell live, the day of
chivalry is not gone by.

With Angell’s assistance as interpreter, the officer told the Indians
that if they would stay where they were for one day, he would go back
to the agency and return within that time with the chief (Captain J. H.
Hurst) and an interpreter and no soldiers. They replied that they would
not move, and, having directed Angell to kill a beef for them, as they
were worn-out and well-nigh starving, and leaving Hump with them to
reassure them, the lieutenant rode back to Fort Bennett, 40 miles away,
notified Captain Hurst, and returned with him, Sergeant Gallagher, and
two Indian scouts as interpreters, the next day. Knowing the importance
of haste, they started out on this winter ride of 40 miles without
blankets or rations.

On arriving Captain Hurst told them briefly what he had come for, and
then, being exhausted from the rapid ride, and knowing that an Indian
must not be hurried, he ordered some beef and a plentiful supply of
tobacco for them, and said that after he and they had eaten and rested
they could talk the matter over. In the evening the principal men met
him and told him over a pipe that they had left Standing Rock agency
forever; that their great chief and friend Sitting Bull had been
killed there without cause; that they had come down to talk with their
friends on Cherry creek about it, but had found them gone, and were
consequently undecided as to what they should do. The captain replied
that he had come as a friend; that if they would surrender their arms
and go back with him to Fort Bennett, they would be provided for and
would not be harmed; that he could make no promises as to their future
disposition; that if they chose to join Big Foot’s camp, only a few
miles up the river, the result would be their certain destruction.
After deliberating among themselves until midnight, they came in a
body, delivered a number of guns, and said they would go back to the
fort. Accordingly they broke camp next morning and arrived at Fort
Bennett on December 24. The entire body numbered 221, including 55
belonging on Cherry creek. These last were allowed to join their own
people camped near the post. The Sitting Bull Indians, with some
others from Standing Rock, numbering 227 in all, were held at Fort
Sully, a few miles below Fort Bennett, until the close of the trouble.
Thirty-eight others of the Sitting Bull band had joined Big Foot and
afterward fled with him. (_War, 11._)

After the death of Sitting Bull and the enlistment of Hump in the
government service, the only prominent leader outside of the Bad Lands
who was considered as possibly dangerous was Sitanka or Big Foot,
whose village was at the mouth of Deep creek, a few miles below the
forks of Cheyenne river. The duty of watching him was assigned to
Lieutenant-Colonel E. V. Sumner of the Eighth cavalry, who had his camp
just above the forks. Here he was visited by Big Foot and his head men,
who assured the officer that they were peaceable and intended to remain
quietly at home. Friendly relations continued until the middle of
December, when Big Foot came to bid good bye, telling Sumner that his
people were all going to the agency to get their annuities. A day or
two later the order came to arrest Big Foot and send him as a prisoner
to Fort Meade. Believing that the chief was acting in good faith to
control his warriors, who might easily go beyond control were he taken
from them, Colonel Sumner informed General Miles that the Indians were
already on their way to the agency; that if Big Foot should return he
(Sumner) would try to get him, and that otherwise he could be arrested
at the agency, if necessary. Soon after, however, the report came that
Big Foot had stopped at Hump’s camp on the way to the agency, to meet
the fugitives coming south from Sitting Bull’s camp.

On receipt of this information, Sumner at once marched down the
river with the intention of stopping Big Foot. When about half way
to Hump’s camp, Big Foot himself came up to meet him, saying that he
was friendly, and that he and his men would obey any orders that the
officer might give. He stated that he had with him 100 of his own
Indians and 38 from Standing Rock (Sitting Bull’s band). When asked why
he had received these last, knowing that they were refugees from their
reservation, he replied that they were his brothers and relations; that
they had come to his people hungry, footsore, and almost naked; and
that he had taken them in and fed them, and that no one with a heart
could do any less.

Sumner then directed one of his officers, Captain Hennisee, to go
to the Indian camp with Big Foot and bring in all the Indians. That
officer started and returned the next day, December 21, with 333
Indians. This large number was a matter of surprise in view of Big
Foot’s statement shortly before, but it is possible that in speaking
of his party he intended to refer only to the warriors. They went into
camp as directed, turned out their ponies to graze, and were fed, and
on the next morning all started quietly back with the troops. As they
had all along appeared perfectly friendly and compliant with every
order, no attempt was made to disarm them. On arriving near their own
village, however, it became apparent that Big Foot could not control
their desire to go to their homes. The chief came frankly to Sumner and
said that he himself would go wherever wanted, but that there would be
trouble to force the women and children, who were cold and hungry, away
from their village. He protested also that they were now at home, where
they had been ordered by the government to stay, and that none of them
had done anything to justify their removal. As it was evident that they
would not go peaceably, Colonel Sumner determined to bring his whole
force on the next day to compel them. In the meantime he sent a white
man named Dunn, who had a friendly acquaintance with Big Foot, to tell
him that the Indians must obey the order to remove. Dunn delivered the
message and returned, being followed later by the interpreter, with the
statement that the Indians had consented to go to the agency, and would
start the next morning, December 23. That evening, however, scouts came
in with the word that the Indians had left their village and were going
southward. It was at first thought that they intended turning off on
another trail to the agency, but instead of doing so they kept on in
the direction of Pine Ridge and the refugees in the Bad Lands, taking
with them only their ponies and tipi poles.

The cause of this precipitate flight after the promise given by Big
Foot is somewhat uncertain. The statement of the interpreter, Felix
Benoit, would make it appear that the Indians were frightened by Dunn,
who told them that the soldiers were coming in the morning to carry
them off and to shoot them if they refused to go. While this doubtless
had the effect of alarming them, the real cause of their flight was
probably the fact that just at this critical juncture Colonel Merriam
was ordered to move with his command up Cheyenne river to join forces
with Sumner in compelling their surrender. Such is the opinion of
General Ruger, who states officially that “Big Foot and adherents who
had joined him, probably becoming alarmed on the movement of Colonel
Merriam’s command from Fort Bennett and a rumor that Colonel Sumner
would capture them, eluded Colonel Sumner’s command and started for the
Pine Ridge reservation.” This agrees with the statement of several of
the survivors that they had been frightened from their homes by the
news of Merriam’s approach. Sumner, in his report, calls attention to
the fact that they committed no depredations in their flight, although
they passed several ranches and at one time even went through a pasture
filled with horses and cattle without attempting to appropriate them.
He also expresses the opinion that Big Foot was compelled unwillingly
to go with his people. The whole number of fugitives was at least 340,
including a few from the bands of Sitting Bull and Hump. Immediately
on learning of their flight Colonel Sumner notified General Carr,
commanding in the direction of the Bad Lands. (_War, 12._)

The situation at this crisis is thus summed up by Indian Commissioner
Morgan:

  Groups of Indians from the different reservations had commenced
  concentrating in the Bad Lands upon or in the vicinity of the Pine
  Ridge reservation. Killing of cattle and destruction of other
  property by these Indians, almost entirely within the limits of
  Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations, occurred, but no signal fires
  were built, no warlike demonstrations were made, no violence was
  done to any white settler, nor was there cohesion or organization
  among the Indians themselves. Many of them were friendly Indians,
  who had never participated in the ghost dance, but had fled thither
  from fear of soldiers, in consequence of the Sitting Bull affair
  or through the overpersuasion of friends. The military gradually
  began to close in around them and they offered no resistance, and
  a speedy and quiet capitulation of all was confidently expected.
  (_Comr., 34._)

Nearly 3,000 troops were now in the field in the Sioux country. This
force was fully sufficient to have engaged the Indians with success,
but as such action must inevitably have resulted in wholesale killing
on both sides, with the prospect of precipitating a raiding warfare
unless the hostiles were completely annihilated, it was thought best to
bring about a surrender by peaceful means.

The refugees in the Bad Lands who had fled from Pine Ridge and Rosebud
had been surrounded on the west and north by a strong cordon of troops,
operating under General Brooke, which had the effect of gradually
forcing them back toward the agency. At the same time that officer
made every effort to expedite the process by creating dissensions in
the Indian camp, and trying in various ways to induce them to come
in by small parties at a time. To this end the Indians were promised
that if they complied with the orders of the military their rights
and interests would be protected, so far as it was within the power
of the military department to accomplish that result. Although they
had about lost confidence in the government, these assurances had a
good effect, which was emphasized by the news of the death of Sitting
Bull, the arrest of Big Foot, and return of Hump to his agency, and
the steady pressure of the troops from behind; and on December 27,
1890, the entire force broke camp and left their stronghold in the Bad
Lands and began moving in toward the agency at Pine Ridge. The several
detachments of troops followed behind, within supporting distance of
one another, and so closely that the fires were still burning in the
Indian camps when the soldiers moved in to occupy the same ground.
(_War, 13._)

As early as December 6 a conference had been brought about at
Pine Ridge, through the efforts of Father Jutz, the priest of the
Catholic mission, between General Brooke and the leading chiefs of
both friendlies and “hostiles.” Although no definite conclusion was
reached, the meeting was a friendly one, ending with a feast and an
Indian dance. The immediate effect was a division in the hostile camp,
culminating in a quarrel between the two factions, with the result that
Two Strike and his party left the rest and moved in toward the agency,
while Short Bull and Kicking Bear retreated farther into the Bad Lands.
On learning of this condition of affairs, General Brooke sent out
American Horse and Big Road with a large party of warriors to meet Two
Strike and go back with him to persuade the others, if possible, to
come in. At the same time the troops were moved up to intercept the
flight of the hostiles. (_Colby, 2; G. D., 37._)

On Christmas day the Cheyenne scouts, camped on Battle creek north of
the Bad Lands, were attacked by a party of hostiles led by Kicking Bear
in person. The fight was kept up until after dark, several being killed
or wounded on both sides, but the hostiles were finally driven off.
(_Colby, 3._)

But the tragedy was near at hand. Orders had been given to intercept
Big Foot’s party in its flight from Cheyenne river toward the Bad
Lands. This was accomplished on December 28, 1890, by Major Whitside
of the Seventh cavalry, who came up with him a short distance west of
the Bad Lands. Not having succeeded in communicating with the refugees
who had fled there and who were already on their way to the agency,
Big Foot had made no stop, but continued on also toward Pine Ridge.
On sighting the troops he raised a white flag, advanced into the open
country, and asked for a parley. This was refused by Major Whitside,
who demanded an unconditional surrender, which was at once given, and
the Indians moved on with the troops to Wounded Knee creek, about 20
miles northeast of Pine Ridge agency, where they camped as directed by
Major Whitside. In order to make assurance complete, General Brooke
sent Colonel Forsyth to join Major Whitside with four additional troops
of the Seventh cavalry, which, with the scouts under Lieutenant Taylor,
made up a force of eight troops of cavalry, one company of scouts, and
four pieces of light artillery (Hotchkiss guns), with a total force
of 470 men, as against a total of 106 warriors then present in Big
Foot’s band. A scouting party of Big Foot’s band was out looking for
the camp under Kicking Bear and Short Bull, but as these chiefs, with
their followers, were already on their way to the agency, the scouting
party was returning to rejoin Big Foot when the fight occurred the next
morning. It was the intention of General Miles to send Big Foot and his
followers back to their own reservation, or to remove them altogether
from the country until the excitement had subsided. (_War, 14._)

At this time there were no Indians in the Bad Lands. Two Strike and
Crow Dog had come in about a week before and were now camped close to
the agency. Kicking Bear and Short Bull, with their followers, had
yielded to the friendly persuasions of American Horse, Little Wound,
Standing Bear, and others who had gone out to them in the interests of
peace, and both parties were now coming in together and had arrived at
the Catholic mission, 5 miles from the agency, when the battle occurred.

On the morning of December 29, 1890, preparations were made to disarm
the Indians preparatory to taking them to the agency and thence to
the railroad. In obedience to instructions the Indians had pitched
their tipis on the open plain a short distance west of the creek and
surrounded on all sides by the soldiers. In the center of the camp the
Indians had hoisted a white flag as a sign of peace and a guarantee of
safety. Behind them was a dry ravine running into the creek, and on
a slight rise in the front was posted the battery of four Hotchkiss
machine guns, trained directly on the Indian camp. In front, behind,
and on both flanks of the camp were posted the various troops of
cavalry, a portion of two troops, together with the Indian scouts,
being dismounted and drawn up in front of the Indians at the distance
of only a few yards from them. Big Foot himself was ill of pneumonia in
his tipi, and Colonel Forsyth, who had taken command as senior officer,
had provided a tent warmed with a camp stove for his reception.

Shortly after 8 oclock in the morning the warriors were ordered to
come out from the tipis and deliver their arms. They came forward and
seated themselves on the ground in front of the troops. They were
then ordered to go by themselves into their tipis and bring out and
surrender their guns. The first twenty went and returned in a short
time with only two guns. It seemed evident that they were unwilling
to give them up, and after consultation of the officers part of the
soldiers were ordered up to within ten yards of the group of warriors,
while another detachment of troops was ordered to search the tipis.
After a thorough hunt these last returned with about forty rifles,
most of which, however, were old and of little value. The search had
consumed considerable time and created a good deal of excitement among
the women and children, as the soldiers found it necessary in the
process to overturn the beds and other furniture of the tipis and in
some instances drove out the inmates. All this had its effect on their
husbands and brothers, already wrought up to a high nervous tension
and not knowing what might come next. While the soldiers had been
looking for the guns Yellow Bird, a medicine-man, had been walking
about among the warriors, blowing on an eagle-bone whistle, and urging
them to resistance, telling them that the soldiers would become weak
and powerless, and that the bullets would be unavailing against the
sacred “ghost shirts,” which nearly every one of the Indians wore. As
he spoke in the Sioux language, the officers did not at once realize
the dangerous drift of his talk, and the climax came too quickly for
them to interfere. It is said one of the searchers now attempted to
raise the blanket of a warrior. Suddenly Yellow Bird stooped down and
threw a handful of dust into the air, when, as if this were the signal,
a young Indian, said to have been Black Fox from Cheyenne river, drew a
rifle from under his blanket and fired at the soldiers, who instantly
replied with a volley directly into the crowd of warriors and so near
that their guns were almost touching. From the number of sticks set up
by the Indians to mark where the dead fell, as seen by the author a
year later, this one volley must have killed nearly half the warriors
(plate +XCIX+). The survivors sprang to their feet, throwing their
blankets from their shoulders as they rose, and for a few minutes there
was a terrible hand to hand struggle, where every man’s thought was
to kill. Although many of the warriors had no guns, nearly all had
revolvers and knives in their belts under their blankets, together with
some of the murderous warclubs still carried by the Sioux. The very
lack of guns made the fight more bloody, as it brought the combatants
to closer quarters.

Just beyond the limit of the map, toward the west, the ravine forms
a bend, in which a number of hostiles took refuge, and from which
Lieutenant Hawthorne was shot. Captain Wallace was found near the
center of the council ring. Big Foot was killed two or three yards
in front of his tent. Father Craft was near the center of the ring
when stabbed. The Indians broke to the west through B and K troops.
While in the council ring all the warriors had on blankets, with their
arms, principally Winchester rifles, concealed under them. Most of
the warriors, including the medicine-man, were painted and wore ghost
shirts.

At the first volley the Hotchkiss guns trained on the camp opened fire
and sent a storm of shells and bullets among the women and children,
who had gathered in front of the tipis to watch the unusual spectacle
of military display. The guns poured in 2-pound explosive shells at
the rate of nearly fifty per minute, mowing down everything alive. The
terrible effect may be judged from the fact that one woman survivor,
Blue Whirlwind, with whom the author conversed, received fourteen
wounds, while each of her two little boys was also wounded by her side.
In a few minutes 200 Indian men, women, and children, with 60 soldiers,
were lying dead and wounded on the ground, the tipis had been torn down
by the shells and some of them were burning above the helpless wounded,
and the surviving handful of Indians were flying in wild panic to the
shelter of the ravine, pursued by hundreds of maddened soldiers and
followed up by a raking fire from the Hotchkiss guns, which had been
moved into position to sweep the ravine.

There can be no question that the pursuit was simply a massacre,
where fleeing women, with infants in their arms, were shot down after
resistance had ceased and when almost every warrior was stretched
dead or dying on the ground. On this point such a careful writer as
Herbert Welsh says: “From the fact that so many women and children
were killed, and that their bodies were found far from the scene of
action, and as though they were shot down while flying, it would look
as though blind rage had been at work, in striking contrast to the
moderation of the Indian police at the Sitting Bull fight when they
were assailed by women.” (_Welsh, 3._) The testimony of American Horse
and other friendlies is strong in the same direction. (See page 839.)
Commissioner Morgan in his official report says that “Most of the men,
including Big Foot, were killed around his tent, where he lay sick. The
bodies of the women and children were scattered along a distance of two
miles from the scene of the encounter.” (_Comr., 35._)

This is no reflection on the humanity of the officer in charge. On the
contrary, Colonel Forsyth had taken measures to guard against such an
occurrence by separating the women and children, as already stated, and
had also endeavored to make the sick chief, Big Foot, as comfortable as
possible, even to the extent of sending his own surgeon, Dr Glennan, to
wait on him on the night of the surrender. Strict orders had also been
issued to the troops that women and children were not to be hurt. The
butchery was the work of infuriated soldiers whose comrades had just
been shot down without cause or warning. In justice to a brave regiment
it must be said that a number of the men were new recruits fresh from
eastern recruiting stations, who had never before been under fire, were
not yet imbued with military discipline, and were probably unable in
the confusion to distinguish between men and women by their dress.

After examining all the official papers bearing on the subject in the
files of the War Department and the Indian Office, together with the
official reports of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and of the
Secretary of War and the several officers engaged; after gathering
all that might be obtained from unofficial printed sources and from
conversation with survivors and participants in the engagement on both
sides, and after going over the battle-ground in company with the
interpreter of the scouts engaged, the author arrives at the conclusion
that when the sun rose on Wounded Knee on the fatal morning of December
29, 1890, no trouble was anticipated or premeditated by either Indians
or troops; that the Indians in good faith desired to surrender and
be at peace, and that the officers in the same good faith had made
preparations to receive their surrender and escort them quietly to
the reservation; that in spite of the pacific intent of Big Foot and
his band, the medicine-man, Yellow Bird, at the critical moment urged
the warriors to resistance and gave the signal for the attack; that
the first shot was fired by an Indian, and that the Indians were
responsible for the engagement; that the answering volley and attack by
the troops was right and justifiable, but that the wholesale slaughter
of women and children was unnecessary and inexcusable.

Authorities differ as to the number of Indians present and killed
at Wounded Knee. General Ruger states that the band numbered about
340, including about 100 warriors, but Major Whitside, to whom they
surrendered, reported them officially as numbering 120 men and 250
women and children, a total of 370. (_War, 15_; _G. D., 38_.) This
agrees almost exactly with the statement made to the author by Mr
Asay, a trader who was present at the surrender. General Miles says
that there were present 106 warriors, a few others being absent at the
time in search of the party under Kicking Bear and Short Bull. (_War,
16._) Among those who surrendered were about 70 refugees from the
bands of Sitting Bull and Hump. (_G. D., 39._) No exact account of the
dead could be made immediately after the fight, on account of a second
attack by another party of Indians coming up from the agency. Some of
the dead and wounded left on the field were undoubtedly carried off by
their friends before the burial party came out three days later, and of
those brought in alive a number afterward died of wounds and exposure,
but received no notice in the official reports. The Adjutant-General,
in response to a letter of inquiry, states that 128 Indians were killed
and 33 wounded. Commissioner Morgan, in his official report, makes the
number killed 146. (_Comr., 36._) Both these estimates are evidently
too low. General Miles, in his final report, states that about 200
men, women, and children were killed. (_War, 17._) General Colby, who
commanded the Nebraska state troops, says that about 100 men and over
120 women and children were found dead on the field, a total of about
220. (_Colby, 4._) Agent Royer telegraphed immediately after the fight
that about 300 Indians had been killed, and General Miles, telegraphing
on the same day, says, “I think very few Indians have escaped.” (_G.
D., 40._) Fifty-one Indians were brought in the same day by the troops,
and a few others were found still alive by the burial party three days
later. A number of these afterward died. No considerable number got
away, being unable to reach their ponies after the fight began. General
Miles states that 98 warriors were killed on the field. (_War, 18._)
The whole number killed on the field, or who later died from wounds and
exposure, was probably very nearly 300.

According to an official statement from the Adjutant-General, 31
soldiers were killed in the battle. About as many more were wounded,
one or two of whom afterward died. All of the killed, excepting
Hospital Steward Pollock and an Indian scout named High Backbone,
belonged to the Seventh cavalry, as did probably also nearly all
of the wounded. The only commissioned officer killed was Captain
Wallace. He received four bullet wounds in his body and finally sank
under a hatchet stroke upon the head. Lieutenant E. A. Garlington, of
the Seventh cavalry, and Lieutenant H. L. Hawthorne, of the Second
artillery, were wounded. (_War, 19._) The last-named officer owed his
life to his watch, which deflected the bullet that otherwise would have
passed through his body.

Below is given a complete list of officers and enlisted men who were
killed, or died of wounds or exposure, in connection with the Sioux
campaign. The statement is contained in an official letter of reply
from the Adjutant-General’s office dated May 26, 1894. Unless otherwise
noted all were of the Seventh cavalry and were killed on December 29,
the date of the battle of Wounded Knee. In addition to these, two
others, Henry Miller, a herder, and George Wilhauer, of the Nebraska
militia, were killed in the same connection. With the 6 Indian police
killed in arresting Sitting Bull, this makes a total of 49 deaths on
the government side, including 7 Indians and a negro:

  Adams, William.
  Bone, Albert S. (corporal, died of wounds).
  Casey, Edward W. (first lieutenant Twenty-second infantry,
    January 7).

  Wallace, George B. (captain).
  Zehnder, Bernhard (died of wounds).

The heroic missionary priest, Father Craft, who had given a large
part of his life to work among the Sioux, by whom he was loved and
respected, had endeavored at the beginning of the trouble to persuade
the stampeded Indians to come into the agency, but without success,
the Indians claiming that no single treaty ever made with them had
been fulfilled in all its stipulations. Many of the soldiers being
of his own faith, he accompanied the detachment which received the
surrender of Big Foot, to render such good offices as might be possible
to either party. In the desperate encounter he was stabbed through the
lungs, but yet, with bullets flying about him and hatchets and warclubs
circling through the air, he went about his work, administering the
last religious consolation to the dying until he fell unconscious
from loss of blood. He was brought back to the agency along with the
other wounded, and although his life was despaired of for some time,
he finally recovered. In talking about Wounded Knee with one of the
friendly warriors who had gone into the Bad Lands to urge the hostiles
to come in, he spoke with warm admiration of Father Craft, and I asked
why it was, then, that the Indians had tried to kill him. He replied,
“They did not know him. Father Jutz [the priest at the Drexel Catholic
mission, previously mentioned] always wears his black robe, but Father
Craft on that day wore a soldier’s cap and overcoat. If he had worn his
black robe, no Indian would have hurt him.” On inquiring afterward
I learned that this was not correct, as Father Craft did have on his
priestly robes. From the Indian statement, however, and the well-known
affection in which he was held by the Sioux, it is probable that the
Indian who stabbed him was too much excited at the moment to recognize
him.

[Illustration: PL. XCVIII

  AFTER THE BATTLE]

The news of the battle was brought to the agency by Lieutenant Guy
Preston, of the Ninth cavalry, who, in company with a soldier and an
Indian scout, made the ride of 16 or 18 miles in a little over an hour,
one horse falling dead of exhaustion on the way. There were then at the
agency, under command of General Brooke, about 300 men of the Second
infantry and 50 Indian police.

The firing at Wounded Knee was plainly heard by the thousands of
Indians camped about the agency at Pine Ridge, who had come in from
the Bad Lands to surrender. They were at once thrown into great
excitement, undoubtedly believing that there was a deliberate purpose
on foot to disarm and massacre them all, and when the fugitives—women
and children, most of them—began to come in, telling the story of the
terrible slaughter of their friends and showing their bleeding wounds
in evidence, the camp was divided between panic and desperation.
A number of warriors mounted in haste and made all speed to the
battle-ground, only about two hours distant, where they met the troops,
who were now scattered about, hunting down the fugitives who might
have escaped the first killing, and picking up the dead and wounded.
The soldiers were driven in toward the center, where they threw up
entrenchments, by means of which they were finally able to repel the
attacking party. With the assistance of a body of Indian scouts and
police, they then gathered up the dead and wounded soldiers, with
some of the wounded Indians and a few other prisoners to the number
of 51, and came into the agency. In the meantime the hostiles under
Two Strike had opened fire on the agency from the neighboring hills
and endeavored to approach, by way of a deep ravine, near enough to
set fire to the buildings. General Brooke, desiring to avoid a general
engagement, ordered out the Indian police—a splendidly drilled body
of 50 brave men—who gallantly took their stand in the center of the
agency inclosure, in full view of the hostiles, some of whom were their
own relatives, and kept them off, returning the fire of besiegers with
such good effect as to kill two and wound several others. The attacking
party, as well as those who rode out to help their kinsmen at Wounded
Knee, were not the Pine Ridge Indians (Ogalala) but the Brulé from
Rosebud under the lead of Two Strike, Kicking Bear, and Short Bull. On
the approach of the detachment returning from Wounded Knee almost the
entire body that had come in to surrender broke away and fell back to a
position on White Clay creek, where the next day found a camp of 4,000
Indians, and including more than a thousand warriors now thoroughly
hostile. On the evening of the battle General Miles telegraphed to
military headquarters, “Last night everything looked favorable for
getting all the Indians under control; since report from Forsyth it
looks more serious than at any other time.” (_G. D., 41._) It seemed
that all the careful work of the last month had been undone.

At the first indication of coming trouble in November all the outlying
schools and mission stations on Pine Ridge reservation had been
abandoned, and teachers, farmers, and missionaries had fled to the
agency to seek the protection of the troops, all but the members of
the Drexel Catholic mission, 5 miles northwest from the agency. Here
the two or three priests and five Franciscan sisters remained quietly
at their post, with a hundred little children around them, safe in the
assurance of the “hostiles” that they would not be molested. While the
fighting was going on at Wounded Knee and hundreds of furious warriors
were firing into the agency, where the handful of whites were shivering
in spite of the presence of troops and police, these gentle women and
the kindly old German priest were looking after the children, feeding
the frightened fugitive women, and tenderly caring for the wounded
Indians who were being brought in from Wounded Knee and the agency.
Throughout all these weeks of terror they went calmly about the duties
to which they had consecrated their lives, and kept their little flock
together and their school in operation, without the presence of a
single soldier, completely cut off from the troops and the agency and
surrounded by thousands of wild Indians.

Some time afterward, in talking with the Indians about the events
of the campaign, the warrior who had spoken with such admiration of
Father Craft referred with the same affectionate enthusiasm to Father
Jutz, and said that when the infuriated Indians attacked the agency
on hearing of the slaughter at Wounded Knee they had sent word to the
mission that no one there need be afraid. “We told him to stay where
he was and no Indian would disturb him,” said the warrior. He told how
the priest and the sisters had fed the starving refugees and bound up
the wounds of the survivors who escaped the slaughter, and then after a
pause he said: “He is a brave man; braver than any Indian.” Curious to
know why this man had not joined the hostiles, among whom were several
of his near relatives, I asked him the question. His reply was simple:
“I had a little boy at the Drexel mission. He died and Father Jutz put
a white stone over him. That is why I did not join the hostiles.”

While visiting Pine Ridge in 1891 I went out to see the Drexel school
and found Father John Jutz, a simple, kindly old German from the
Tyrol, with one or two other German lay brothers and five Franciscan
sisters, Americans. Although but a recent establishment, the school
was in flourishing condition, bearing in everything the evidences of
orderly industry. Like a true German of the Alps, Father Jutz had
already devised a way to make jelly from the wild plums and excellent
wine from the chokecherry. While talking, the recess hour arrived and
a bevy of small children came trooping in, pushing over one another
in the effort to get hold of a finger of the good father, or at least
to hold on to his robe while he led them into another room where one
of the sisters gave to each a ginger cake, hot from the oven. The room
was filled with the shouts and laughter of the children and the father
explained, “Children get hungry, and we always have some cakes for the
little ones at recess. I let the boys be noisy in the playroom as long
as they don’t fight. It is good for them.” Looking at the happy, noisy
crowd around the black-gowned missionary and sister, it was easy to
see how they had felt safe in the affection of the Indians through all
the days and nights when others were trembling behind breastworks and
files of soldiers. Referring to what the Indians had told me, I asked
Father Jutz if it was true that the hostiles had sent word to them not
to be afraid. He replied, “Yes; they had sent word that no one in the
mission need be alarmed,” and then, with a gentle smile, he added, “But
it was never our intention to leave.” It was plain enough that beneath
the quiet exterior there burned the old missionary fire of Jogues and
Marquette.

  BATTLEFIELD OF WOUNDED KNEE]

The conflict at Wounded Knee bore speedy fruit. On the same day, as
has been said, a part of the Indians under Two Strike attacked the
agency and the whole body of nearly 4,000 who had come in to surrender
started back again to intrench themselves in preparation for renewed
hostilities. On the morning of December 30, the next day after the
fight, the wagon train of the Ninth cavalry (colored) was attacked
within 2 miles of the agency while coming in with supplies. One soldier
was killed, but the Indians were repulsed with the loss of several of
their number.

On the same day news came to the agency that the hostiles had attacked
the Catholic mission 5 miles out, and Colonel Forsyth with eight
troops of the Seventh cavalry and one piece of artillery was ordered
by General Brooke to go out and drive them off. It proved that the
hostiles had set fire to several houses between the mission and
the agency, but the mission had not been disturbed. As the troops
approached the hostiles fell back, but Forsyth failed to occupy the
commanding hills and was consequently surrounded by the Indians, who
endeavored to draw him into a canyon and pressed him so closely that he
was obliged to send back three times for reinforcements. Major Henry
had just arrived at the agency with a detachment of the Ninth cavalry,
and on hearing the noise of the firing started at once to the relief of
Forsyth with four troops of cavalry and a Hotchkiss gun. On arriving
on the ground he occupied the hills and thus succeeded in driving off
the hostiles without further casualty, and rescued the Seventh from its
dangerous position. In this skirmish, known as the “mission fight,”
the Seventh lost one officer, Lieutenant Mann, and a private, Dominic
Francischetti, killed, and seven wounded. (_War, 20; G. D., 42._)

The conduct of the colored troops of the Ninth cavalry on this occasion
deserves the highest commendation. At the time of the battle at Wounded
Knee, the day before, they were in the Bad Lands, about 80 or 90 miles
out from Pine Ridge, when the order was sent for them to come in to aid
in repelling the attack on the agency. By riding all night they arrived
at the agency at daylight, together with two Hotchkiss guns, in charge
of Lieutenant John Hayden of the First artillery. Hardly had they
dismounted when word arrived that their wagon train, coming on behind,
was attacked, and they were obliged to go out again to its relief,
as already described. On coming in again they lay down to rest after
their long night ride, when they were once more called out to go to the
aid of the Seventh at the mission. Jumping into the saddle they rode
at full speed to the mission, 5 miles out, repelled the hostiles and
saved the command, and returned to the agency, after having ridden over
100 miles and fought two engagements within thirty hours. Lieutenant
Hayden, with his Hotchkiss, who had come in with them from the Bad
Lands, took part also with them in the mission fight.

On the same evening Standing Soldier, an Indian scout, arrived at the
agency with a party of 65 Indians, including 18 men. These were a part
of Big Foot’s or Short Bull’s following, who had lost their way during
the flight from Cheyenne river and were hunting for the rest of the
band when captured by the scouts. They were not aware of the death
of Big Foot and the extermination of his band, but after having been
disarmed and put under guard they were informed of it, but only in a
mild way, in order not to provoke undue excitement. (_G. D., 43._)

Immediately after the battle of Wounded Knee, in consequence of the
panic among the frontier settlers of Nebraska, the Nebraska state
troops were called out under command of General L. W. Colby. They
were stationed at the most exposed points between the settlements and
the reservation and remained in the field until the surrender of the
hostiles two weeks later. The only casualty among them was the death
of private George Wilhauer, who was accidentally shot by a picket.
(_Colby, 5._)

On New Year’s day of 1891, three days after the battle, a detachment of
troops was sent out to Wounded Knee to gather up and bury the Indian
dead and to bring in the wounded who might be still alive on the field.
In the meantime there had been a heavy snowstorm, culminating in a
blizzard. The bodies of the slaughtered men, women, and children were
found lying about under the snow, frozen stiff and covered with blood
(plate +XCVIII+). Almost all the dead warriors were found lying near
where the fight began, about Big Foot’s tipi, but the bodies of the
women and children were found scattered along for 2 miles from the
scene of the encounter, showing that they had been killed while trying
to escape. (_Comr., 37; Colby, 6._) A number of women and children
were found still alive, but all badly wounded or frozen, or both, and
most of them died after being brought in. Four babies were found
alive under the snow, wrapped in shawls and lying beside their dead
mothers, whose last thought had been of them. They were all badly
frozen and only one lived. The tenacity of life so characteristic of
wild people as well as of wild beasts was strikingly illustrated in
the case of these wounded and helpless Indian women and children who
thus lived three days through a Dakota blizzard, without food, shelter,
or attention to their wounds. It is a commentary on our boasted
Christian civilization that although there were two or three salaried
missionaries at the agency not one went out to say a prayer over the
poor mangled bodies of these victims of war. The Catholic priests had
reasons for not being present, as one of them, Father Craft, was lying
in the hospital with a dangerous wound received on the battlefield
while bravely administering to the dying wants of the soldiers in the
heat of the encounter, and the other, Father Jutz, an old man of 70
years, was at the mission school 5 miles away, still attending to his
little flock of 100 children as before the trouble began, and unaware
of what was transpiring at the agency.

  BURYING THE DEAD]

  Zitkala-noni (1891).]

A long trench was dug and into it were thrown all the bodies, piled one
upon another like so much cordwood, until the pit was full, when the
earth was heaped over them and the funeral was complete (plate +C+).
Many of the bodies were stripped by the whites, who went out in order
to get the “ghost shirts,” and the frozen bodies were thrown into the
trench stiff and naked. They were only dead Indians. As one of the
burial party said, “It was a thing to melt the heart of a man, if it
was of stone, to see those little children, with their bodies shot
to pieces, thrown naked into the pit.” The dead soldiers had already
been brought in and buried decently at the agency. When the writer
visited the spot the following winter, the Indians had put up a wire
fence around the trench and smeared the posts with sacred red medicine
paint (plate +CI+).

  GRAVE OF THE DEAD AT WOUNDED KNEE]

[Illustration: +Fig. 81+—Survivors of Wounded Knee—Jennie Sword (1891).]

A baby girl of only three or four months was found under the snow,
carefully wrapped up in a shawl, beside her dead mother, whose body was
pierced by two bullets. On her head was a little cap of buckskin, upon
which the American flag was embroidered in bright beadwork. She had
lived through all the exposure, being only slightly frozen, and soon
recovered after being brought into the agency. Her mother being killed,
and, in all probability, her father also, she was adopted by General
Colby, commanding the Nebraska state troops. The Indian women in camp
gave her the poetic name of Zitkala-noni, “Lost Bird,” and by the
family of her adoption she was baptized under the name of Marguerite
(figure 80). She is now (1896) living in the general’s family at
Washington, a chubby little girl 6 years of age, as happy with her
dolls and playthings as a little girl of that age ought to be.

Another little girl about 5 years of age was picked up on the
battlefield and brought in by the Indian police on the afternoon of the
fight. She was adopted by George Sword, captain of the Indian police,
and is now living with him under the name of Jennie Sword, a remarkably
pretty little girl, gentle and engaging in her manners (figure 81).

[Illustration: +Fig. 82+—Survivors of Wounded Knee—Herbert Zitkalazi
  (1892).]

A little boy of four years, the son of Yellow Bird, the medicine-man,
was playing on his pony in front of a tipi when the firing began. As
he described it some time ago in lisping English: “My father ran and
fell down and the blood came out of his mouth [he was shot through the
head], and then a soldier put his gun up to my white pony’s nose and
shot him, and then I ran and a policeman got me.” As his father was
thus killed and his mother was already dead, he was adopted by Mrs Lucy
Arnold, who had been a teacher among the Sioux and knew his family
before the trouble began. She had already given him his name, Herbert
Zitkalazi, the last word being the Sioux form of his father’s name,
“Yellow Bird.” She brought him back with her to Washington, where he
soon learned English and became a general favorite of all who knew
him for his affectionate disposition and unusual intelligence, with
genuine boyish enthusiasm in all he undertook. His picture here given
(figure 82) is from a photograph made in Lafayette park, Washington,
in 1892. His adopted mother having resumed her school work among his
tribe, he is now back with her, attending school under her supervision
at Standing Rock, where, as in Washington, he seems to be a natural
leader among those of his own age. When we think of these children
and consider that only by the merest accident they escaped the death
that overtook a hundred other children at Wounded Knee, who may all
have had in themselves the same possibilities of affection, education,
and happy usefulness, we can understand the sickening meaning of such
affairs as the Chivington massacre in Colorado and the Custer fight on
the Washita, where the newspaper reports merely that “the enemy was
surprised and the Indian camp destroyed.”

[Illustration: PL. CII

  BATTLEFIELD AFTER THE BLIZZARD]

The Indian scouts at Wounded Knee, like the Indian police at Grand
river and Pine Ridge, were brave and loyal, as has been the almost
universal rule with Indians when enlisted in the government service,
even when called on, as were these, to serve against their own tribe
and relatives. The prairie Indian is a born soldier, with all the
soldier’s pride of loyalty to duty, and may be trusted implicitly after
he has once consented to enter the service. The scouts at Wounded Knee
were Sioux, with Philip Wells as interpreter. Other Sioux scouts were
ranging the country between the agency and the hostile camp in the Bad
Lands, and acted as mediators in the peace negotiations which led to
the final surrender. Fifty Cheyenne and about as many Crow scouts were
also employed in the same section of country. Throughout the entire
campaign the Indian scouts and police were faithful and received the
warmest commendation of their officers.

On New Year’s day, 1891, Henry Miller, a herder, was killed by Indians
a few miles from the agency. This was the only noncombatant killed by
the Indians during the entire campaign, and during the same period
there was no depredation committed by them outside of the reservation.
On the next day the agent reported that the school buildings and
Episcopal church on White Clay creek had been burned by hostiles, who
were then camped to the number of about 3,000 on Grass creek, 15 miles
northeast of the agency. They had captured the government beef herd
and were depending on it for food. Red Cloud, Little Wound, and their
people were with them and were reported as anxious to return, but
prevented by the hostile leaders, Two Strike, Short Bull, and Kicking
Bear, who threatened to kill the first one who made a move to come
in. (_G. D., 44._) A few days later a number of Red Cloud’s men came
in and surrendered and reported that the old chief was practically
a prisoner and wanted the soldiers to come and rescue him from the
hostiles, who were trying to force him into the war. They reported
further that there was much suffering from cold and hunger in the
Indian camp, and that all the Ogalala (Red Cloud’s people of Pine
Ridge) were intending to come in at once in a body.

On the 3d of January General Miles took up his headquarters at Pine
Ridge and directed General Brooke to assume immediate command of the
troops surrounding the hostile camp. Brooke’s men swung out to form the
western and northern part of a circle about the hostiles, cutting them
off from the Bad Lands, while the troops under General Carr closed in
on the east and northeast in such a way that the Indians were hemmed in
and unable to make a move in any direction excepting toward the agency.

On January 3 a party of hostiles attacked a detachment of the Sixth
cavalry under Captain Kerr on Grass creek, a few miles north of the
agency, but were quickly repulsed with the loss of four of their
number, the troops having been reinforced by other detachments in the
vicinity. In this engagement the Indian scouts again distinguished
themselves. (_War, 21._) The effect of this repulse was to check the
westward movement of the hostiles and hold them in their position along
White Clay creek until their passion had somewhat abated.

On January 5 there was another encounter on Wounded Knee creek. A small
detachment which had been sent out to meet a supply train coming into
the agency found the wagons drawn up in a square to resist an attack
made by a band of about 50 Indians. The soldiers joined forces with
the teamsters, and by firing from behind the protection of the wagons
succeeded in driving off the Indians and killing a number of their
horses. The hostiles were reinforced, however, and a hard skirmish was
kept up for several hours until more troops arrived from the agency
about dark, having been sent in answer to a courier who managed to
elude the attacking party. The troops charged on a gallop and the
Indians retreated, having lost several killed and wounded, besides a
number of their horses. (_Colby, 7._)

Amid all these warlike alarms the gentle muse Calliope hovered over
the field and inspired W. H. Prather, a colored private of troop I of
the Ninth cavalry, to the production of the ballad given below, one of
the few good specimens of American ballad poetry, and worthy of equal
place with “Captain Lovewell’s Fight,” “Old Quebec,” or anything that
originated in the late rebellion. It became a favorite among the troops
in camp and with the scattered frontiersmen of Dakota and Nebraska,
being sung to a simple air with vigor and expression and a particularly
rousing chorus, and is probably by this time a classic of the barracks.
It is here reproduced verbatim from the printed slip published for
distribution among the soldiers during the campaign.


                   +The Indian Ghost Dance and War+

      The Red Skins left their Agency, the Soldiers left their Post,
      All on the strength of an Indian tale about Messiah’s ghost
      Got up by savage chieftains to lead their tribes astray;
      But Uncle Sam wouldn’t have it so, for he ain’t built that way.
      They swore that this Messiah came to them in visions sleep,
      And promised to restore their game and Buffalos a heap,
      So they must start a big ghost dance, then all would join their band,
      And may be so we lead the way into the great Bad Land.
  _Chorus_:
      They claimed the shirt Messiah gave, no bullet could go through,
      But when the Soldiers fired at them they saw this was not true.
      The Medicine man supplied them with their great Messiah’s grace,
      And he, too, pulled his freight and swore the 7th hard to face.

      About their tents the Soldiers stood, awaiting one and all,
      That they might hear the trumpet clear when sounding General call
      Or Boots and Saddles in a’rush, that each and every man
      Might mount in haste, ride soon and fast to stop this devilish band
      But Generals great like Miles and Brooke don’t do things up that way,
      For they know an Indian like a book, and let him have his sway
      Until they think him far enough and then to John they’ll say,
      “You had better stop your fooling or we’ll bring our guns to play.”
  _Chorus._—They claimed the shirt, etc.

      The 9th marched out with splendid cheer the Bad Lands to explo’e—
      With Col. Henry at their head they never fear the foe;
      So on they rode from Xmas eve ’till dawn of Xmas day;
      The Red Skins heard the 9th was near and fled in great dismay;
      The 7th is of courage bold both officers and men,
      But bad luck seems to follow them and twice has took them in;
      They came in contact with Big Foot’s warriors in their fierce might
      This chief made sure he had a chance of vantage in the fight.
  _Chorus._—They claimed the shirt, etc.

      A fight took place, ’twas hand to hand, unwarned by trumpet call,
      While the Sioux were dropping man by man—the 7th killed them all,
      And to that regiment be said “Ye noble braves, well done,
      Although you lost some gallant men a glorious fight you’ve won.”
      The 8th was there, the sixth rode miles to swell that great command
      And waited orders night and day to round up Short Bull’s band.
      The Infantry marched up in mass the Cavalry’s support,
      And while the latter rounded up, the former held the fort.
  _Chorus._—They claimed the shirt, etc.

      E battery of the 1st stood by and did their duty well,
      For every time the Hotchkiss barked they say a hostile fell.
      Some Indian soldiers chipped in too and helped to quell the fray,
      And now the campaign’s ended and the soldiers marched away.
      So all have done their share, you see, whether it was thick or thin,
      And all helped break the ghost dance up and drive the hostiles in.
      The settlers in that region now can breathe with better grace;
      They only ask and pray to God to make John hold his base.
  _Chorus._—They claimed the shirt, etc.
                                        (W. H. Prather, I, 9th Cavalry).




               APPENDIX—THE INDIAN STORY OF WOUNDED KNEE


  [_From the Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for 1891,
    volume 1, pages 179–181. Extracts from verbatim stenographic
    report of council held by delegations of Sioux with Commissioner
    of Indian Affairs, at Washington, February 11, 1891._]

+Turning Hawk+, Pine Ridge (Mr Cook, interpreter). Mr Commissioner, my
purpose to-day is to tell you what I know of the condition of affairs
at the agency where I live. A certain falsehood came to our agency from
the west which had the effect of a fire upon the Indians, and when
this certain fire came upon our people those who had farsightedness
and could see into the matter made up their minds to stand up against
it and fight it. The reason we took this hostile attitude to this fire
was because we believed that you yourself would not be in favor of this
particular mischief-making thing; but just as we expected, the people
in authority did not like this thing and we were quietly told that we
must give up or have nothing to do with this certain movement. Though
this is the advice from our good friends in the east, there were, of
course, many silly young men who were longing to become identified with
the movement, although they knew that there was nothing absolutely bad,
nor did they know there was anything absolutely good, in connection
with the movement.

In the course of time we heard that the soldiers were moving toward the
scene of trouble. After awhile some of the soldiers finally reached our
place and we heard that a number of them also reached our friends at
Rosebud. Of course, when a large body of soldiers is moving toward a
certain direction they inspire a more or less amount of awe, and it is
natural that the women and children who see this large moving mass are
made afraid of it and be put in a condition to make them run away. At
first we thought that Pine Ridge and Rosebud were the only two agencies
where soldiers were sent, but finally we heard that the other agencies
fared likewise. We heard and saw that about half our friends at Rosebud
agency, from fear at seeing the soldiers, began the move of running
away from their agency toward ours (Pine Ridge), and when they had
gotten inside of our reservation they there learned that right ahead of
them at our agency was another large crowd of soldiers, and while the
soldiers were there, there was constantly a great deal of false rumor
flying back and forth. The special rumor I have in mind is the threat
that the soldiers had come there to disarm the Indians entirely and to
take away all their horses from them. That was the oft-repeated story.

So constantly repeated was this story that our friends from Rosebud,
instead of going to Pine Ridge, the place of their destination, veered
off and went to some other direction toward the “Bad Lands.” We did not
know definitely how many, but understood there were 300 lodges of them,
about 1,700 people. Eagle Pipe, Turning Bear, High Hawk, Short Bull,
Lance, No Flesh, Pine Bird, Crow Dog, Two Strike, and White Horse were
the leaders.

Well, the people after veering off in this way, many of them who
believe in peace and order at our agency, were very anxious that some
influence should be brought upon these people. In addition to our love
of peace we remembered that many of these people were related to us by
blood. So we sent out peace commissioners to the people who were thus
running away from their agency.

I understood at the time that they were simply going away from fear
because of so many soldiers. So constant was the word of these good
men from Pine Ridge agency that finally they succeeded in getting
away half of the party from Rosebud, from the place where they
took refuge, and finally were brought to the agency at Pine Ridge.
Young-Man-Afraid-of-his-Horses, Little Wound, Fast Thunder, Louis
Shangreau, John Grass, Jack Red Cloud, and myself were some of these
peace-makers.

The remnant of the party from Rosebud not taken to the agency finally
reached the wilds of the Bad Lands. Seeing that we had succeeded
so well, once more we sent to the same party in the Bad Lands and
succeeded in bringing these very Indians out of the depths of the Bad
Lands and were being brought toward the agency. When we were about a
day’s journey from our agency we heard that a certain party of Indians
(Big Foot’s band) from the Cheyenne River agency was coming toward Pine
Ridge in flight.

+Captain Sword.+ Those who actually went off of the Cheyenne River
agency probably number 303, and there were a few from the Standing Rook
reserve with them, but as to their number I do not know. There were a
number of Ogalallas, old men and several school boys, coming back with
that very same party, and one of the very seriously wounded boys was a
member of the Ogalalla boarding school at Pine Ridge agency. He was not
on the warpath, but was simply returning home to his agency and to his
school after a summer visit to relatives on the Cheyenne river.

+Turning Hawk.+ When we heard that these people were coming toward our
agency we also heard this. These people were coming toward Pine Ridge
agency, and when they were almost on the agency they were met by the
soldiers and surrounded and finally taken to the Wounded Knee creek,
and there at a given time their guns were demanded. When they had
delivered them up, the men were separated from their families, from
their tipis, and taken to a certain spot. When the guns were thus taken
and the men thus separated, there was a crazy man, a young man of very
bad influence and in fact a nobody, among that bunch of Indians fired
his gun, and of course the firing of a gun must have been the breaking
of a military rule of some sort, because immediately the soldiers
returned fire and indiscriminate killing followed.

+Spotted Horse.+ This man shot an officer in the army; the first shot
killed this officer. I was a voluntary scout at that encounter and I
saw exactly what was done, and that was what I noticed; that the first
shot killed an officer. As soon as this shot was fired the Indians
immediately began drawing their knives, and they were exhorted from all
sides to desist, but this was not obeyed. Consequently the firing began
immediately on the part of the soldiers.

+Turning Hawk.+ All the men who were in a bunch were killed right
there, and those who escaped that first fire got into the ravine, and
as they went along up the ravine for a long distance they were pursued
on both sides by the soldiers and shot down, as the dead bodies showed
afterwards. The women were standing off at a different place from where
the men were stationed, and when the firing began, those of the men
who escaped the first onslaught went in one direction up the ravine,
and then the women, who were bunched together at another place, went
entirely in a different direction through an open field, and the women
fared the same fate as the men who went up the deep ravine.

+American Horse.+ The men were separated, as has already been said,
from the women, and they were surrounded by the soldiers. Then came
next the village of the Indians and that was entirely surrounded by the
soldiers also. When the firing began, of course the people who were
standing immediately around the young man who fired the first shot were
killed right together, and then they turned their guns, Hotchkiss guns,
etc., upon the women who were in the lodges standing there under a flag
of truce, and of course as soon as they were fired upon they fled, the
men fleeing in one direction and the women running in two different
directions. So that there were three general directions in which they
took flight.

There was a women with an infant in her arms who was killed as she
almost touched the flag of truce, and the women and children of course
were strewn all along the circular village until they were dispatched.
Right near the flag of truce a mother was shot down with her infant;
the child not knowing that its mother was dead was still nursing, and
that especially was a very sad sight. The women as they were fleeing
with their babes were killed together, shot right through, and the
women who were very heavy with child were also killed. All the Indians
fled in these three directions, and after most all of them had been
killed a cry was made that all those who were not killed or wounded
should come forth and they would be safe. Little boys who were not
wounded came out of their places of refuge, and as soon as they came
in sight a number of soldiers surrounded them and butchered them there.

Of course we all feel very sad about this affair. I stood very loyal
to the government all through those troublesome days, and believing
so much in the government and being so loyal to it, my disappointment
was very strong, and I have come to Washington with a very great blame
on my heart. Of course it would have been all right if only the men
were killed; we would feel almost grateful for it. But the fact of the
killing of the women, and more especially the killing of the young boys
and girls who are to go to make up the future strength of the Indian
people, is the saddest part of the whole affair and we feel it very
sorely.

I was not there at the time before the burial of the bodies, but I did
go there with some of the police and the Indian doctor and a great many
of the people, men from the agency, and we went through the battlefield
and saw where the bodies were from the track of the blood.

+Turning Hawk.+ I had just reached the point where I said that the
women were killed. We heard, besides the killing of the men, of the
onslaught also made upon the women and children, and they were treated
as roughly and indiscriminately as the men and boys were.

Of course this affair brought a great deal of distress upon all the
people, but especially upon the minds of those who stood loyal to the
government and who did all that they were able to do in the matter of
bringing about peace. They especially have suffered much distress and
are very much hurt at heart. These peace-makers continued on in their
good work, but there were a great many fickle young men who were ready
to be moved by the change in the events there, and consequently, in
spite of the great fire that was brought upon all, they were ready
to assume any hostile attitude. These young men got themselves in
readiness and went in the direction of the scene of battle so they
might be of service there. They got there and finally exchanged shots
with the soldiers. This party of young men was made up from Rosebud,
Ogalalla (Pine Ridge), and members of any other agencies that happened
to be there at the time. While this was going on in the neighborhood
of Wounded Knee—the Indians and soldiers exchanging shots—the agency,
our home, was also fired into by the Indians. Matters went on in this
strain until the evening came on, and then the Indians went off down by
White Clay creek. When the agency was fired upon by the Indians from
the hillside, of course the shots were returned by the Indian police
who were guarding the agency buildings.

Although fighting seemed to have been in the air, yet those
who believed in peace were still constant at their work.
Young-Man-Afraid-of-his-Horses, who had been on a visit to some other
agency in the north or northwest, returned, and immediately went out
to the people living about White Clay creek, on the border of the
Bad Lands, and brought his people out. He succeeded in obtaining the
consent of the people to come out of their place of refuge and return
to the agency. Thus the remaining portion of the Indians who started
from Rosebud were brought back into the agency. Mr Commissioner, during
the days of the great whirlwind out there, those good men tried to hold
up a counteracting power, and that was “Peace.” We have now come to
realize that peace has prevailed and won the day. While we were engaged
in bringing about peace our property was left behind, of course, and
most of us have lost everything, even down to the matter of guns with
which to kill ducks, rabbits, etc, shotguns, and guns of that order.
When Young-Man-Afraid brought the people in and their guns were asked
for, both men who were called hostile and men who stood loyal to the
government delivered up their guns.




                             +Chapter XIV+

          CLOSE OF THE OUTBREAK—THE GHOST DANCE IN THE SOUTH


In the meantime overtures of peace had been made by General Miles to
the hostiles, most of whose leaders he knew personally, having received
their surrender on the Yellowstone ten years before, at the close of
the Custer war. On the urgent representations of himself and others
Congress had also appropriated the necessary funds for carrying out
the terms of the late treaty, by the disregard of which most of the
trouble had been caused, so that the commander was now able to assure
the Indians that their rights and necessities would receive attention.
They were urged to come in and surrender, with a guaranty that the
general himself would represent their case with the government. At
the same time they were informed that retreat was cut off and that
further resistance would be unavailing. As an additional step toward
regaining their confidence, the civilian agents were removed from the
several disturbed agencies, which were then put in charge of military
officers well known and respected by the Indians. Cheyenne River agency
was assigned to Captain J. H. Hurst, and Rosebud agency to Captain J.
M. Lee, while Royer, at Pine Ridge, was superseded on January 8 by
Captain. F. E. Pierce. The last-named officer was afterward relieved by
Captain Charles G. Penney, who is now in charge. (_War, 22; Comr., 38;
G. D., 45._)

The friendly overtures made by General Miles, with evidences
that the government desired to remedy their grievances, and that
longer resistance was hopeless, had their effect on the hostiles.
Little Wound, Young-man-afraid-of-his-horses (more properly,
“Young-man-of-whose-horses-they-are-afraid”), Big Road, and other
friendly chiefs, also used their persuasions with such good effect
that by January 12 the whole body of nearly 4,000 Indians had moved
in to within sight of the agency and expressed their desire for
peace. The troops closed in around them, and on the 16th of January,
1891, the hostiles surrendered, and the outbreak was at an end. They
complied with every order and direction given by the commander, and
gave up nearly 200 rifles, which, with other arms already surrendered,
made a total of between 600 and 700 guns, more than had ever before
been surrendered by the Sioux at one time. As a further guaranty of
good faith, the commander demanded the surrender of Kicking Bear and
Short Bull, the principal leaders, with about twenty other prominent
warriors, as hostages. The demand was readily complied with, and the
men designated came forward voluntarily and gave themselves up as
sureties for the good conduct of their people. They were sent to Fort
Sheridan, Illinois, near Chicago, where they were kept until there was
no further apprehension, and were then returned to their homes. (_War,
23; Colby, 8._) After the surrender the late hostiles pitched their
camp, numbering in all 742 tipis, in the bottom along White Clay creek,
just west of the agency, where General Miles had supplies of beef,
coffee, and sugar issued to them from the commissary department, and
that night they enjoyed the first full meal they had known in several
weeks.

Thus ended the so-called Sioux outbreak of 1890–91. It might be better
designated, however, as a Sioux panic and stampede, for, to quote the
expressive letter of McGillycuddy, writing under date of January 15,
1891, “Up to date there has been neither a Sioux outbreak or war.
No citizen in Nebraska or Dakota has been killed, molested, or can
show the scratch of a pin, and no property has been destroyed off the
reservation.” (_Colby, 9._) Only a single noncombatant was killed by
the Indians, and that was close to the agency. The entire time occupied
by the campaign, from the killing of Sitting Bull to the surrender at
Pine Ridge, was only thirty-two days. The late hostiles were returned
to their homes as speedily as possible. The Brulé of Rosebud, regarded
as the most turbulent of the hostiles, were taken back to the agency
by Captain Lee, for whom they had respect, founded on an acquaintance
of several years’ standing, without escort and during the most intense
cold of winter, but without any trouble or dissatisfaction whatever.
The military were returned to their usual stations, and within a few
weeks after the surrender affairs at the various agencies were moving
again in the usual channel.

An unfortunate event occurred just before the surrender in the killing
of Lieutenant E. W. Casey of the Twenty-second infantry by Plenty
Horses, a young Brulé, on January 7. Lieutenant Casey was in command
of a troop of Cheyenne scouts, and was stationed at the mouth of White
Clay creek, charged with the special duty of watching the hostile camp,
which was located 8 miles farther up the creek at No Water’s place.
On the day before his death several of the hostiles had visited him
and held a friendly conference. The next morning, in company with two
scouts, he went out avowedly for the purpose of observing the hostile
camp more closely. He rode up to within a short distance of the camp,
meeting and talking with several of the Indians on the way, and had
stopped to talk with a half-blood relative of Red Cloud, when Plenty
Horses, a short distance away, deliberately shot him through the
head, and he fell from his horse dead. His body was not disturbed by
the Indians, but was brought in by some of the Cheyenne scouts soon
after. Plenty Horses was arraigned before a United States court, but
was acquitted on the ground that as the Sioux were then at war and the
officer was practically a spy upon the Indian camp, the act was not
murder in the legal sense of the word. Lieutenant Casey had been for a
year in charge of the Cheyenne scouts and had taken great interest in
their welfare and proficiency, and his death was greatly deplored by
the Indians as the insane act of a boy overcome by the excitement of
the times. (_War, 24; Comr., 39; Colby, 10; G. D., 46._)

On January 11 an unprovoked murder was committed on a small party of
peaceable Indians on Belle Fourche, or North fork of Cheyenne river,
by which the Indians who had come in to surrender were once more
thrown into such alarm that for a time it seemed as if serious trouble
might result. A party of Ogalala from Pine Ridge, consisting of Few
Tails, a kindly, peaceable old man, with his wife, an old woman, and
One Feather, with his wife and two children—one a girl about 13 years
of age and the other an infant—had been hunting in the Black Hills
under a pass from the agency. They had had a successful hunt, and were
returning with their two wagons well loaded with meat, when they camped
for the night at the mouth of Alkali creek. During the evening they
were visited by some soldiers stopping at a ranch a few miles distant,
who examined their pass and pronounced it all right. In the morning,
after breakfast, the Indians started on again toward the agency, but
had gone only a few hundred yards when they were fired upon by a party
of white men concealed near the road. The leaders of the whites were
three brothers named Culbertson, one of whom had but recently returned
from the penitentiary. One of the murderers had visited the Indians in
their camp the night before, and even that very morning. At the first
fire Few Tails was killed, together with both ponies attached to the
wagon. His wife jumped out and received two bullets, which brought her
to the ground. The murderers rode past her, however, to get at the
other Indian, who was coming up behind in the other wagon with his wife
and two children. As soon as he saw his companion killed, One Feather
turned his wagon in the other direction, and, telling his wife, who had
also been shot, to drive on as fast as she could to save the children,
he jumped upon one of the spare ponies and held off the murderers
until his family had had time to make some distance. He then turned
and joined his family and drove on for some 8 or 10 miles until the
pursuers came up again, when he again turned and fought them off, while
his wife went ahead with the wagon and the children. The wounded woman
bravely drove on, while the two little children lay down in the wagon
with their heads covered up in the blankets. As they drove they passed
near a house, from which several other shots were fired at the flying
mother, when her husband again rode up and kept off the whole party
until the wagon could get ahead. Finally, as the ponies were tired out,
this heroic man abandoned the wagon and put the two children on one
of the spare ponies and his wounded wife and himself upon another and
continued to retreat until the whites gave up the pursuit. He finally
reached the agency with the wife and children.

The wife of Few Tails, after falling wounded by two bullets beside
the wagon in which was her dead husband, lay helpless and probably
unconscious upon the ground through all the long winter night until
morning, when she revived, and finding one of the horses still alive,
mounted it and managed by night to reach a settler’s house about 15
miles away. Instead of meeting help and sympathy, however, she was
driven off by the two men there with loaded rifles, and leaving her
horse in her fright, she hurried away as well as she could with a
bullet in her leg and another in her breast, passing by the trail of
One Feather’s wagon with the tracks of his pursuers fresh behind it,
until she came near a trader’s store about 20 miles farther south.
Afraid to go near it on account of her last experience, the poor woman
circled around it, and continued, wounded, cold, and starving as she
was, to travel by night and hide by day until she reached the Bad
Lands. The rest may be told in her own words:

  After that I traveled every night, resting daytime, until I got
  here at the beef corral. Then I was very tired, and was near the
  military camp, and early in the morning a soldier came out and he
  shouted something back, and in a few minutes fifty men were there,
  and they got a blanket and took me to a tent. I had no blanket and
  my feet were swelled, and I was about ready to die. After I got to
  the tent a doctor came in—a soldier doctor, because he had straps
  on his shoulders—and washed me and treated me well.

A few of the soldiers camped near the scene of the attack had joined
in the pursuit at the beginning, on the representations of some of
the murderers, but abandoned it as soon as they found their mistake.
According to all the testimony, the killing was a wanton, unprovoked,
and deliberate murder, yet the criminals were acquitted in the local
courts. The apathy displayed by the authorities of Meade county,
South Dakota, in which the murder was committed, called forth some
vigorous protests. Colonel Shafter, in his statement of the case,
concludes, referring to the recent killing of Lieutenant Casey: “So
long as Indians are being arrested and held for killing armed men
under conditions of war, it seems to me that the white murderers
of a part of a band of peaceful Indians should not be permitted to
escape punishment.” The Indians took the same view of the case, and
when General Miles demanded of Young-man-afraid-of-his-horses the
surrender of the slayers of Casey and the herder Miller, the old chief
indignantly replied: “No; I will not surrender them, but if you will
bring the white men who killed Few Tails, I will bring the Indians who
killed the white soldier and the herder; and right out here in front of
your tipi I will have my young men shoot the Indians and you have your
soldiers shoot the white men, and then we will be done with the whole
business.”

In regard to the heroic conduct of One Feather, the officer then in
charge of the agency says: “The determination and genuine courage, as
well as the generalship he manifested in keeping at a distance the
six men who were pursuing him, and the devotion he showed toward his
family, risking his life against great odds, designate him as entitled
to a place on the list of heroes.” (_War, 25; Comr., 40; G. D., 47._)

On the recommendation of General Miles, a large delegation of the
principal leaders of both friendly and hostile parties among the Sioux
was allowed to visit Washington in February, 1891, to present their
grievances and suggest remedies for dissatisfaction in the future.
Among the principal speakers were: From Pine Ridge, American Horse,
Captain George Sword, Big Road, and He Dog; from Rosebud, White Bird
and Turning Hawk; from Cheyenne River, Little No Heart and Straight
Head; from Standing Rock, John Grass and Mad Bear. The interpreters
were Reverend C. S. Cook, David Zephier, Louis Primeau, Louis Richard,
Clarence Three Stars, and Louis Shangreau. Their visit was eminently
satisfactory and resulted in the inauguration of a more efficient
administration of Sioux affairs for the future. Steps were taken to
reimburse those whose ponies had been confiscated at the time of
the Custer war in 1876, and additional appropriations were made for
rations, so that before the end of the year the Indians were receiving
half as much more as before the outbreak. (_War, 26._) On returning to
their homes the Indians of the various Sioux agencies went to work in
good faith putting in their crops and caring for their stock, and in a
short time all further apprehension was at an end.

The discussion of Indian affairs in connection with the outbreak led
to the passage by Congress of a bill which enacted that all future
vacancies in the office of Indian agent should be filled by military
officers selected by the Indian office and detailed for the purpose
from the army. At the same time a plan was originated to enlist Indians
as a component part of the regular army. Small parties from various
tribes had long been attached to various posts and commands in an
irregular capacity as scouts. These bodies of scouts were now reduced
in number or disbanded altogether, and in their stead were organized
Indian troops or companies to be regularly attached to the different
cavalry or infantry regiments. In the spring of 1891 officers were sent
out to various western reservations, and succeeded in thus recruiting a
number of regular troops from among the most warlike of the tribes, a
considerable part of these coming from the late hostile Sioux.

Although the campaign lasted only about a month the destruction of life
was great, for an Indian war, and the money loss to the government and
to individuals was something enormous. Three officers and 28 privates
were killed or mortally wounded during the campaign, and 4 officers
and 38 privates were less seriously wounded, several of these dying
later on. (_War, 27._) The Indian loss can not be stated exactly. In
the arrest of Sitting Bull there were killed or mortally wounded 8
of Sitting Bull’s party and 6 police, a total of 14. Those killed in
the Wounded Knee fight, or who afterward died of wounds or exposure,
numbered, according to the best estimates, at least 250. Those
afterward killed in the various small skirmishes, including the Few
Tails affair, may have numbered 20 or 30. In all, the campaign cost the
lives of 49 whites and others on the government side and about 300 or
more Indians.

The direct or incidental expenses of the campaign were as follows:
Expenses of the Department of Justice for defending Plenty Horses
and prosecuting the murderers of Few Tails, unknown; appropriation
by Congress to reimburse Nebraska national guard for expense of
service during the campaign, $43,000; paid out under act of Congress
to reimburse friendly Indians and other legal residents on the
reservations for property destroyed by hostiles, $97,646.85 (_Comr.,
41_); extra expense of Commissary department of the army, $37,764.69;
extra expense of the Medical department of the army, $1,164, besides
extra supplies purchased by individuals; extra expenses of Ordnance
department of the army, for ammunition, not accounted for; total
extra expense of Quartermaster’s department of the army, $915,078.81,
including $120,634.17 for transportation of troops over bonded
railroads. (_A. G. O., 8._) The total expense, public or private, was
probably but little short of $1,200,000, or nearly $40,000 per day, a
significant commentary on the bad policy of breaking faith with Indians.

According to the report of the agency farmer sent out after the trouble
to learn the extent of property of the friendly Indians destroyed
by the hostiles on Pine Ridge agency, there were burned 53 Indian
dwellings, 1 church, 2 schoolhouses, and a bridge, all on White Clay
creek, while nearly every remaining house along the creek had the
windows broken out. A great deal of farming machinery and nearly
all of the hay were burned, while stoves were broken to pieces and
stock killed. A few of the friendly Indians had been so overcome by
the excitement that they had burned their own houses and run their
machinery down high hills into the river, where it was found frozen in
the ice several months later. (_G. D., 48._)

In view of the fact that only one noncombatant was killed and no
depredations were committed off the reservation, the panic among the
frontier settlers of both Dakotas, Nebraska, and Iowa was something
ludicrous. The inhabitants worked themselves into such a high panic
that ranches and even whole villages were temporarily abandoned and the
people flocked into the railroad cities with vivid stories of murder,
scalping, and desolation that had no foundation whatever in fact. A
reliable authority who was on the ground shortly after the scare had
subsided gives this characteristic instance among others:

  In another city, a place of 3,000 inhabitants, 75 miles from any
  Indians and 150 miles from any hostiles, word came about 2 o’clock
  Sunday morning for the militia to be in readiness. The company
  promptly assembled, were instructed and drilled. In an evening
  church service one of the pastors broke out in prayer: “O Lord,
  prepare us for what awaits us. We have just been listening to the
  sweet sounds of praise, but ere the morning sun we may hear the war
  whoop of the red man.” The effect on children and nervous persons
  may be imagined. The legislature was in session and the impression
  upon that body was such as to lead it to make an appropriation for
  the benefit of the state militia at the expense of one to the state
  agricultural fair. (_Comr., 42._)

The crisis produced the usual crop of patriots, all ready to serve
their country—usually for a consideration. Among these was a lady of
Utica, New York, claiming to be of the renowned Iroquois blood, and
styling herself the “Doctor Princess Viroqua,” who, with her sister
“Wynima,” wrote to the Indian Office for a commission to go out to try
the effect of moral suasion on the belligerent Sioux, representing
that by virtue of her descent from a long line of aboriginal princes
she would be welcomed with enthusiasm and accomplish her mission of
peace. (_G. D., 49._) As a matter of fact, neither of the names Viroqua
or Wynima could be pronounced by a genuine Iroquois knowing only his
own tongue, and the second one, Wynima, is borrowed from Meacham’s
sensational history of the Modoc war in California.

The proprietor of a “wild west” show in New York, signing himself Texas
Ben, wrote also volunteering his services and submitting as credentials
his museum letter-head, stating that he had served with Quantrell, and
had the written indorsement of Cole Younger. An old veteran of the Iowa
soldiers’ home wrote to Secretary Noble, with a redundance of capitals
and much bad spelling, offering his help against the hostiles, saying
that he had been “RAZeD” among them and could “ToLK The TUN” and was
ready to “Do eneThin FoR mY CuntRY.” (_G. D., 50._)

A band of patriots in Minnesota, whose early education appears to
have been somewhat neglected, wrote to the Secretary of the Interior
offering to organize a company of 50 men to put down the outbreak,
provided the government would look after a few items which they
enumerated: “The government to Furnish us with Two good Horses Each a
good Winchester Rifle, Two good Cotes Revolvers and give us $300.00
Bounty and say a Salary of Fifty Per Month, Each and our own judgment
and we will settel this Indian question For Ever, and Rations and
Ammunition. We Should Have in addition to this say Five dollars a
Head.” (_G. D., 51._)

A man named Albert Hopkins appeared at Pine Ridge in December, 1890,
wearing a blanket and claiming to be the Indian messiah, and announced
his intention of going alone into the Bad Lands to the Indians, who
were expecting his arrival, with the “Pansy Banner of Peace.” His
claims were ridiculed by Red Cloud and others, and he was promptly
arrested and put off the reservation. However, he was not dead, but
only sleeping, and on March, 1893, having come to Washington, he
addressed an urgent letter to Secretary Noble requesting official
authority to visit the Sioux reservations and to preach to the Indians,
stating that “with the help of the Pansy and its motto and manifest
teaching, ‘Union, Culture, and Peace,’ and the star-pansy banner, of
which I inclose an illustration, I hope to establish the permanent
peace of the border.” He signs himself “Albert C. Hopkins, Pres. Pro.
tem. The Pansy Society of America.”

The letter was referred to the Indian Office, which refused permission.
This brought a reply from Hopkins, who this time signs himself “The
Indian Messiah,” in which he states that as the Indians were expecting
the messiah in the spring, “in accordance with the prophecy of Sitting
Bull,” it was necessary that he should go to them at once, so that they
might “accept the teaching of the pansy and its motto, which now they
only partially or very doubtfully accept.”

Receiving no answer, he wrote again about the end of March, both to the
Secretary and to the Indian Commissioner, stating that messiahs, being
human, were subject to human limitations, of which fact the Indians
were well aware, but warning these officials that if these limitations
were set by the government it would be held responsible for his
nonappearance to the Indians, as he had promised, “before the native
pansies blossom on the prairies.” He ends by stating that he would
leave on Easter Sunday for the Sioux country, but as nothing was heard
of him later, it is presumed that he succumbed to the limitations. (_G.
D., 52._)

                   *       *       *       *       *

The first direct knowledge of the messiah and the Ghost dance came to
the northern Arapaho in Wyoming, through Nakash, “Sage,” who, with
several Shoshoni, visited the messiah in the early spring of 1889, and
on his return brought back to his people the first songs of the dance,
these being probably some of the original Paiute songs of the messiah
himself. The Ghost dance was at once inaugurated among the Shoshoni and
northern Arapaho. In the summer of the same year the first rumors of
the new redeemer reached the southern Arapaho and Cheyenne in Oklahoma,
through the medium of letters written by returned pupils of eastern
government schools.

Fresh reports of wonderful things beyond the mountains were constantly
coming to the northern prairie tribes, and the excitement grew until
the close of the year 1889, when a large delegation, including Sioux,
northern Cheyenne, and northern Arapaho, crossed the mountains to
the Paiute country to see and talk with the messiah. Among the
Sioux delegates were Short Bull, Fire Thunder, and Kicking Bear, as
already stated. Among the Cheyenne were Porcupine and several others,
including one woman. The Arapaho representatives were Sitting Bull
(Hänä′chä-thi′ăk) and Friday. The delegates from the different tribes
met at Wind River reservation, in Wyoming, which they left about
Christmas, and after stopping a short time among the Bannock and
Shoshoni at Fort Hall, went on to Walker lake, in Nevada. They were
gone some time and returned to Wyoming in March of 1890, the Sioux and
Cheyenne continuing on to their homes farther east. According to the
statement of Nakash they had a five days’ conference with the messiah,
who at one time went into a trance, but his visitors did not.

Before their return the southern Arapaho, in Oklahoma, had sent up
Wa′tän-ga′a, “Black Coyote,” an officer of the Indian police, and
Washee, a scout at Fort Reno, to their relatives in Wyoming to learn
definitely as to the truth or falsity of the rumors. Washee went on
to Fort Hall, where his faith failed him, and he came back with the
report that the messiah was only a half-blood. This was not correct,
but Washee himself afterward acknowledged that he had based his report
on hearsay. Black Coyote remained until the other delegates returned
from the Paiute country with the announcement that all that had been
said of the messiah and the advent of a new earth was true. He listened
eagerly to all they had to tell, took part with the rest in the dance,
learned the songs, and returned in April, 1890, and inaugurated the
first Ghost dance in the south among the Arapaho.

[Illustration: PL. CIII

  ARAPAHO GHOST SHIRT SHOWING COLORING]

The Cheyenne, being skeptical by nature, were unwilling to trust
entirely to the report of Black Coyote and so sent up two delegates
of their own, Little Chief and Bark, to investigate the story in the
north. Somewhat later White Shield, another Cheyenne, went up alone on
the same errand. Their report being favorable, the Cheyenne also took
up the Ghost dance in the summer of 1890. They never went into it with
the same fervor, however, and although they had their separate dance
with songs in their own language, they more commonly danced together
with the Arapaho and sang with them the Arapaho songs. For several
years the old Indian dances had been nearly obsolete with these tribes,
but as the new religion meant a revival of the Indian idea they soon
became common again, with the exception of the war dance and others of
that kind which were strictly prohibited by the messiah.

From this time the Ghost dance grew in fervor and frequency among the
Arapaho and Cheyenne. In almost every camp the dance would be held two
or three times a week, beginning about sunset and often continuing
until daylight. The excitement reached fever heat in September, 1890,
when Sitting Bull came down from the northern Arapaho to instruct the
southern tribes in the doctrine and ceremony.

At a great Ghost dance held on South Canadian river, about 2 miles
below the agency at Darlington, Oklahoma, it was estimated that 3,000
Indians were present, including nearly all of the Arapaho and Cheyenne,
with a number of Caddo, Wichita, Kiowa, and others. The first trances
of the Ghost dance among the southern tribes occurred at this time
through the medium of Sitting Bull. One informant states that a leader
named Howling Bull had produced trances at a dance on the Washita some
time before, but the statement lacks confirmation.

As Sitting Bull was the great apostle of the Ghost dance among the
southern tribes, being regarded almost in the same light as the messiah
himself, he merits special notice. He is now about 42 years of age
and at the beginning of his apostleship in 1890 was but 36. He is a
full-blood Arapaho, although rather light in complexion and color of
eyes, and speaks only his native language, but converses with ease in
the universal sign language of the plains. It was chiefly by means of
this sign language that he instructed his disciples among the Caddo,
Wichita, and Kiowa. He is about 5 feet 8 inches tall, dignified but
plain in his bearing, and with a particularly winning smile. His power
over those with whom he comes in contact is evident from the report
of Lieutenant (now Captain) Scott, who had been ordered by the War
Department to investigate the Ghost dance, and who for weeks had been
denouncing him as a humbug, but who, on finally meeting him for the
first time, declares that the opinion formed before seeing him began to
change in his favor almost immediately. (_G. D., 53._) In conversation
with the author Sitting Bull stated that he was originally a southern
Arapaho, but went up to live with the northern branch of the tribe, in
Wyoming, about 1876. When a boy in the south he was known as Bítäye,
“Captor,” but on reaching manhood his name was changed, in conformity
with a common Indian custom, to Hänä′chä-thi′ăk, “Sitting Bull.” On
returning to the south, after having visited the messiah, he found his
brother known under the same name, and to avoid confusion the brother
then adopted the name of Scabby Bull, by which he is now known. It
should be mentioned that an Indian “brother” may be only a cousin, as
no distinction is made in the Indian system. On removing to the south
he fixed his abode near Cantonment, Oklahoma, where he now resides.

[Illustration: +Fig. 83+—Sitting Bull the Arapaho apostle.]

With regard to the reverence in which he was held by his disciples at
this time, and of his own sincerity, Captain Scott says:

  It was very difficult to get an opportunity to talk with him
  quietly on account of the persistent manner in which he was
  followed about. All sorts of people wanted to touch him, men
  and women would come in, rub their hands on him, and cry, which
  demonstration he received with a patient fortitude that was rather
  ludicrous at times. While he by no means told us everything he
  knew, it was easy to believe that he was not the rank impostor
  that I had before considered him. He makes no demands for presents
  while at these camps. This trip entailed a ride of 200 miles in
  the winter season, at the request of the Wichitas, for which I
  understand they paid him $50 before starting, but everything that
  was given him while at this camp was a voluntary gift, prompted
  entirely by the good wishes of the giver. He took but little
  property away when he left, and I saw but one horse that I thought
  he had not brought down with him.

[Illustration: PL. CIV

  ARAPAHO GHOST SHIRT—REVERSE]

  Upon being asked concerning his religion, he said that all I had
  heard must not be attributed to him, as some of it was false; that
  he does not believe that he saw the veritable “Jesus” alive in
  the north, but he did see a man there whom “Jesus” had helped or
  inspired. This person told him that if he persevered in the dance
  it would cause sickness and death to disappear. He avoided some
  of the questions about the coming of the buffalo, etc., and under
  the circumstances it was not possible to draw him out further, and
  the subject of religion was then dropped, with the intention of
  taking it up at a more favorable time, but this time never came. A
  great many of the doings seen at these dances are the afterthoughts
  of all kinds of people. I have seen some of them arise and have
  watched their growth. These are not the teachings of Sitting Bull,
  although he refrains from interfering with them through policy. He
  took no part in the humbuggery going on, but danced and sang like
  the humblest individual there. These things, taken in connection
  with Äpiatañ’s letter, would make it seem that Sitting Bull has
  been a dupe himself partly, and there is a possibility that he is
  largely sincere in his teachings. There is this to be said in his
  favor, that he has given these people a better religion than they
  ever had before, taught them precepts which if faithfully carried
  out will bring them into better accord with their white neighbors,
  and has prepared the way for their final Christianization. For this
  he is entitled to no little credit. (_G. D., 54._)

He made no claim to be a regular medicine-man, and so far as known
never went into a trance himself. Since the failure of his predictions,
especially with regard to the recovery of the ceded reservation, he
has fallen from his high estate. Truth compels us also to state that,
in spite of his apostolic character, he is about as uncertain in his
movements as the average Indian.

After Sitting Bull, the principal leader of the Ghost dance among the
southern Arapaho is Wa′tän-ga′a or Black Coyote, from whom the town of
Watonga, in Canadian county, derives its name. Black Coyote is a man of
considerable importance both in his tribe and in his own estimation,
and aspires to be a leader in anything that concerns his people. With
a natural predisposition to religions things, it is the dream of his
life to be a great priest and medicine-man. At the same time he keeps a
sharp lookout for his temporal affairs, and has managed to accumulate
considerable property in wagons and livestock, including three wives.
Although still a young man, being but little more than 40 years of age,
he has had his share of the world’s honors, being not only a leader
in the Ghost dance and other Indian ceremonies, tribal delegate to
Washington, and captain of the Indian police, but also, in his new
character of an American citizen, deputy sheriff of Canadian county.
He is a good-natured fellow, and vain of his possessions and titles,
but at the same time thoroughly loyal and reliable in the discharge of
his duties, and always ready to execute his orders at whatever personal
risk. His priestly ambition led him to make the journey to the north,
in which he brought back the first songs of the Ghost dance, and thus
became a leader, and a year later he headed a delegation from Oklahoma
to the messiah of Walker lake. He has repeatedly asked me to get for
him a permanent license from the government to enable him to visit the
various reservations at will as a general evangel of Indian medicine
and ceremony. Black Coyote in full uniform, with official badge, a
Harrison medal, and an immense police overcoat, which he procured in
Washington, and riding with his three wives in his own double-seated
coach, is a spectacle magnificent and impressive. Black Coyote in
breechcloth, paint, and feathers, leading the Ghost dance, or sitting
flat on the ground and beating the earth with his hand in excess of
religious fervor, is equally impressive. It was this combination of
vanity of leadership and sense of duty as a government officer that
made him my first and most willing informant on the Ghost dance, and
enabled me through him to do so much with the Arapaho.

In his portrait (plate +CV+) a number of scars will be noticed on his
chest and arms. The full number of these scars is seventy, arranged in
various patterns of lines, circles, crosses, etc., with a long figure
of the sacred pipe on one arm. According to his own statement they were
made in obedience to a dream as a sacrifice to save the lives of his
children. Several of his children had died in rapid succession, and in
accordance with Indian custom he undertook a fast of four days as an
expiation to the overruling spirit. During this time, while lying on
his bed, he heard a voice, somewhat resembling the cry of an owl or the
subdued bark of a dog. The voice told him that if he wished to save his
other children he must cut out seventy pieces of skin and offer them to
the sun. He at once cut out seven pieces, held them out to the sun and
prayed, and then buried them. But the sun was not satisfied, and soon
after he was warned in a vision that the full number of seventy must
be sacrificed if he would save his children. He then did as directed,
cutting out the pieces of skin in the various patterns indicated,
offering each in turn to the sun with a prayer for the health of his
family, and then burying them. Since then there has been no death
in his family. In cutting out the larger pieces, some of which were
several inches long and nearly half an inch wide, the skin was first
lifted up with an awl and then sliced away with a knife. This had to
be done by an assistant, and Black Coyote was particular to show me by
signs, sitting very erect and bracing himself firmly, that he had not
flinched during the process.

As has been stated, the first trances in the southern Ghost dance
occurred at the great dance held near the Cheyenne and Arapaho agency
under the auspices of Sitting Bull in September, 1890. On this occasion
Cheyenne and Arapaho, Caddo, Wichita, Kiowa, and Apache to the number
of perhaps 3,000 assembled, and remained together for about two weeks,
dancing every night until daylight. This was the largest Ghost dance
ever held in the south. After dances had been held for two or three
nights Sitting Bull announced that at the next one he would perform a
great wonder in the sight of all the people, after which they would
be able to make songs for themselves. He said no more, but dismissed
them to their tipis, wondering what this miracle could be. On the
next night he appeared wearing a wide-brim hat with a single eagle
feather, the same hat in which he is generally seen. Nearly all of
the two tribes of Cheyenne and Arapaho were present, and probably 600
or 800 were in the dance circle at one time. Nothing unusual occurred
for several hours until the dancers had gradually worked themselves
up to a high state of excitement, when Sitting Bull stepped into the
circle, and going up close in front of a young Arapaho woman, he began
to make hypnotic passes before her face with the eagle feather. In a
few seconds she became rigid and then fell to the ground unconscious.
Sitting Bull then turned his attention to another and another, and
the same thing happened to each in turn until nearly a hundred were
stretched out on the ground at once. As usual in the trances some
lay thus for a long time, and others recovered sooner, but none were
disturbed, as Sitting Bull told the dancers that these were now
beholding happy visions of the spirit world. When next they came
together those who had been in the trance related their experiences
in the other world, how they had met and talked with their departed
friends and joined in their oldtime amusements. Many of them embodied
their visions in songs, which were sung that night and afterward in the
dance, and from that time the Ghost dance was naturalized in the south
and developed rapidly along new lines. Each succeeding dance resulted
in other visions and new songs, and from time to time other hypnotists
arose, until almost every camp had its own.

About this time a commission arrived to treat with the Cheyenne and
Arapaho for the sale of their reservation. The Indians were much
divided in opinion, the great majority opposing any sale whatsoever,
even of their claim in the Cherokee strip, which they believed was
all that the agreement was intended to cover. While the debate was in
progress Left Hand, chief of the Arapaho, went to Sitting Bull and
asked his opinion on the matter. Sitting Bull advised him to sell for
what they could get, as they had need of the money, and in a short time
the messiah would come and restore the land to them. On this advice
Left Hand signed the agreement, in the face of threats from those
opposed to it, and his example was followed by nearly all of his tribe.
This incident shows how thoroughly Sitting Bull and the other Arapaho
believed in the new doctrine. In view of the misery that has come on
these tribes from the sale of their reservation, it is sad to think
that they could have so deceived themselves by false hopes of divine
interposition. A large party of the Cheyenne refused to have anything
to do with the sale or to countenance the transaction by accepting
their share of the purchase money, even after the whites had taken
possession of the lands.

The troubles in the Sioux country now began to attract public
attention, and there was suggestion of military interference. The
newspaper liar has reached an abnormal development in Oklahoma, and
dispatches from Guthrie, El Reno, and Oklahoma City were filled with
vivid accounts of war dances, scalping parties, and imminent outbreaks,
mingled with frantic appeals for troops. A specimen dispatch stated
that a thousand Kickapoo were dancing, whereas in fact the whole tribe
numbers only 325, very few of whom were in any way concerned with the
Ghost dance. Indian Commissioner Morgan was at this time (November,
1890) on a tour of inspection among the western tribes of Oklahoma, and
satisfied himself that all such sensational reports were false, and
that there was no danger to be apprehended from the dance. (_G. D.,
55._) At the same time the War Department commissioned Lieutenant (now
Captain) H. L. Scott, of the Seventh cavalry, then and now stationed at
Fort Sill, Oklahoma, to investigate the meaning of the excitement and
the possibility of an outbreak. Captain Scott was eminently fitted for
the work by his intimate acquaintance with the Indians and his perfect
knowledge of the sign language. In the course of December, 1890, and
January and February, 1891, he visited the various camps of the western
tribes of the territory, attended a number of dances, and talked with
the leaders. His reports on the Ghost dance are most valuable, and
confirmed the War Department in its previous opinion that no danger was
to be apprehended, and that the true policy was one of noninterference.

The dance constantly gathered strength among the Arapaho and Cheyenne,
in spite of the failure of the first prediction, and spread rapidly
to the neighboring tribes, Sitting Bull himself being the high priest
and chief propagandist. The adverse report brought back by Ä′piatañ,
the Kiowa, in the spring of 1891 had no effect outside of his own
tribe. In the early part of that year the Arapaho and Cheyenne sent a
delegation, including one woman, to visit the messiah in Nevada and
bring back the latest news from heaven. They were gone a considerable
time and returned with some of the sacred medicine paint given them by
Wovoka, after having taken part with the Paiute in a Ghost dance under
his leadership at the regular dance ground near Mason valley. Tall
Bull, captain of the Cheyenne police, was one of this party, and Arnold
Woolworth, a Carlisle student, acted as interpreter.

In August, 1891, another delegation went out, consisting of Black
Coyote, Little Raven, Red Wolf, Grant Left Hand, and Casper Edson
(Arapaho), and Black Sharp Nose and Standing Bull (Cheyenne). Grant
Left Hand and Casper Edson, Carlisle students, acted as interpreters,
wrote down the words of the messiah, and delivered his message to their
people on their return. This message, as written down at the time by
Casper Edson, is given in the preceding chapter on the doctrine of
the Ghost dance. In accord with the messiah’s instructions the two
tribes now changed their manner of dancing from frequent small dances
at each camp at irregular intervals to larger dances participated in
by several camps together at regular intervals of six weeks, each
dance continuing for five consecutive days. The Caddo and Wichita also
adopted the new rule in agreement with instructions brought back by
a delegation sent out about the same time. The change was opposed by
Sitting Bull and some others, but the delegates, having the authority
of the messiah for the innovation, succeeded in carrying their point,
and thereafter assumed a leadership on equal terms with Sitting Bull,
who from that time lost much of his interest in the dance. They were
gone about two weeks, and brought back with them a quantity of the
sacred paint and a large number of magpie feathers, the kind commonly
worn by the Paiute in the Ghost dance. This started a demand for
magpie feathers, and the shrewd traders soon turned the fact to their
own advantage by importing selected crow feathers, which they sold to
the unsuspecting Indians for the genuine article at the rate of two
feathers for a quarter. While in the land of the Paiute the delegates
took part in the Ghost dance at Mason valley, and were thrown into a
trance by Wovoka, as related in chapter +IX+.

The Ghost dance practically superseded all other dances among the
Cheyenne and Arapaho, and constantly developed new features, notably
the auxiliary “crow dance,” which was organized by Grant Left Hand.
This was claimed as a dance seen in a trance vision of the spirit
world, but is really only a modification of the “Omaha dance,” common
to the northern prairie tribes. The opening of the reservation and
the influx of the whites served to intensify the religious fervor of
the Indians, who were now more than ever made to feel their dependent
and helpless condition. It was impossible, however, that the intense
mental strain could endure forever, and after the failure of the
predictions on the appointed dates the wild excitement gradually cooled
and crystallized into a fixed but tranquil expectation of ultimate
happiness under the old conditions in another world.

In October, 1892, another delegation, consisting of Sitting Bull and
his wife, with Washee and two other Arapaho, and Edward Guerrier, a
half-blood Cheyenne, visited the messiah. They brought back a very
discouraging report, which was in substance that the messiah was tired
of so many visitors and wanted them to go home and tell their tribes
to stop dancing. Although the Indians generally refused to accept the
message as genuine, the effect was naturally depressing. A year later,
in October, 1893, Black Coyote and several others dictated through me a
letter to Wovoka, asking him to send them some of the sacred paint or
anything else that would make them think of him, with “some good words
to help us and our children,” and requesting to know whether he had
been truthfully reported by the delegates of the preceding year. To one
who knows these people their simple religious faith is too touching to
be a subject of amusement.

The messiah doctrine never gained many converts among the Comanche,
excepting those of the Penätĕ′ka division and a few others living
on the Little Washita and other streams on the northern boundary of
the reservation, adjoining the tribes most interested in the Ghost
dance. These Comanche held a few Ghost dances and made a few songs,
but the body of the tribe would have nothing to do with it. This lack
of interest was due partly to the general skeptical temperament of the
Comanche, evinced in their carelessness in regard to ceremonial forms,
and partly to their tribal pride, which forbade their following after
the strange gods of another people, as they considered their own mescal
rite sufficient to all their needs. Quanah Parker, their head chief, a
shrewd half-blood, opposed the new doctrine and prevented its spread
among his tribe.

                   *       *       *       *       *

The Ghost dance was brought to the Pawnee, Ponca, Oto, Missouri, Kansa,
Iowa, Osage, and other tribes in central Oklahoma by delegates from
the Arapaho and Cheyenne in the west. The doctrine made slow progress
for some time, but by February, 1892, the majority of the Pawnee were
dancing in confident expectation of the speedy coming of the messiah
and the buffalo. Of all these tribes the Pawnee took most interest in
the new doctrine, becoming as much devoted to the Ghost dance as the
Arapaho themselves. The leader among the Pawnee was Frank White, and
among the Oto was Buffalo Black. The agent in charge took stringent
measures against the dance, and had the Oto prophet arrested and
confined in the Wichita jail, threatening at the same time to cut
off supplies from the tribe. As the confederated Oto and Missouri
number only 362 in all, they were easily brought into subjection, and
the dance was abandoned. The same method was pursued with the Pawnee
prophet and his people, but as they are stronger in number than the
Oto, they were proportionately harder to deal with, but the final
result was the same. (_Comr., 43._) The Osage gave but little heed
to the story, perhaps from the fact that, as they are the wealthiest
tribe in the country, they feel no such urgent need of a redeemer as
their less fortunate brethren. The Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo, and Potawatomi
engaged in the dance only to a limited extent, for the reason that a
number of the natives of these tribes, particularly the Potawatomi,
are under Catholic influences, while most of the others adhere to the
doctrine of Känakûk, the Potawatomi prophet mentioned in chapter +V+.

The Ghost dance doctrine was communicated directly to the Caddo,
Wichita, Kichai, Delaware, and Kiowa by the Arapaho and Cheyenne,
their neighbors on the north. We shall speak now of the tribes first
mentioned, leaving the Kiowa until the last. The Caddo, Wichita,
Kichai, and several remnants of cognate tribes, with a small band
of the Delaware, numbering in all about a thousand Indians, occupy
a reservation between the Washita and the South Canadian in western
Oklahoma, having the Arapaho and Cheyenne on the north and west, the
Kiowa on the south, and the whites of Oklahoma and the Chickasaw nation
on the east. The Caddo are the leading tribe, numbering more than half
of the whole body. They were the first of these to take up the dance,
and have manifested the greatest interest in it from the time it was
introduced among them.

A number of Caddo first attended the great Ghost dance held by the
Cheyenne and Arapaho on the South Canadian in the fall of 1890 on the
occasion when Sitting Bull came down from the north and inaugurated
the trances. On returning to their homes they started the Ghost dance,
which they kept up, singing the Arapaho songs as they had heard them
on the Canadian, until Sitting Bull came down about December, 1890, to
give them further instruction in the doctrine and to “give the feather”
to the seven persons selected to lead the ceremony. From this time
the Caddo had songs and trances of their own, the chief priest and
hypnotist of the dance being Nĭshkû′ntŭ, “Moon Head,” or John Wilson.
The Caddo and the Delaware usually danced together on Boggy Creek.
The Wichita and the Kichai, who took the doctrine from the Caddo,
usually danced together on Sugar creek about 15 miles from the agency
at Anadarko, but manifested less interest in the matter until Sitting
Bull came down about the beginning of February, 1891, and “gave the
feather” to the leaders. From this time all these tribes went into the
dance heart and soul, on some occasions dancing for days and nights
together from the middle of the afternoon until the sun was well up in
the morning. The usual custom was to continue until about midnight.
Cold weather had no deterrent effect, and they kept up the dance in the
snow, the trance subjects sometimes lying unconscious in the snow for
half an hour at a time. At this time it was confidently expected that
the great change would occur in the spring, and as the time drew near
the excitement became most intense. The return of the Kiowa delegate,
Ä′piatañ, in the middle of February, 1891, with a report adverse to the
messiah, produced no effect on the Caddo and their confederates, who
refused to put any faith in his statements, claiming that he had not
seen the real messiah or else had been bribed by the whites to make a
false report.

About the time that Black Coyote and the others went out to see the
messiah in the fall of 1891 the Caddo and their confederates sent out
a delegation for the same purpose. The delegates were Billy Wilson and
Squirrel (Caddo), Nashtowi and Lawrie Tatum (Wichita), and Jack Harry
(Delaware). Tatum was a schoolboy and acted as interpreter for the
party. Like the Arapaho they came back impressed with reverence for the
messiah, and at once changed the time and method of the dancing, in
accordance with his instructions, to periodical dances at intervals of
six weeks, continuing for five consecutive days, the dance on the last
night being kept up until daylight, when all the participants went down
to bathe in the stream and then dispersed to their homes. They were
dancing in this fashion when last visited in the fall of 1893.

The principal leader of the Ghost dance among the Caddo is Nĭshkû′ntŭ,
“Moon Head,” known to the whites as John Wilson. Although considered a
Caddo, and speaking only that language, he is very much of a mixture,
being half Delaware, one-fourth Caddo, and one-fourth French. One
of his grandfathers was a Frenchman. As the Caddo lived originally
in Louisiana, there is a considerable mixture of French blood among
them, which manifests itself in his case in a fairly heavy beard. He
is about 50 years of age, rather tall and well built, and wears his
hair at full length flowing loosely over his shoulders. With a good
head and strong, intelligent features, he presents the appearance of
a natural leader. He is also prominent in the mescal rite, which has
recently come to his tribe from the Kiowa and Comanche. He was one
of the first Caddo to go into a trance, the occasion being the great
Ghost dance held by the Arapaho and Cheyenne near Darlington agency,
at which Sitting Bull presided, in the fall of 1890. On his return to
consciousness he had wonderful things to tell of his experiences in the
spirit world, composed a new song, and from that time became the high
priest of the Caddo dance. Since then his trances have been frequent,
both in and out of the Ghost dance, and in addition to his leadership
in this connection he assumes the occult powers and authority of a
great medicine-man, all the powers claimed by him being freely conceded
by his people.

When Captain Scott was investigating the Ghost dance among the Caddo
and other tribes of that section, at the period of greatest excitement,
in the winter of 1890–91, he met Wilson, of whom he has this to say:

  John Wilson, a Caddo man of much prominence, was especially
  affected, performing a series of gyrations that were most
  remarkable. At all hours of the day and night his cry could
  be heard all over camp, and when found he would be dancing in
  the ring, possibly upon one foot, with his eyes closed and the
  forefinger of his right hand pointed upward, or in some other
  ridiculous posture. Upon being asked his reasons for assuming these
  attitudes he replied that he could not help it; that it came over
  him just like cramps.

Somewhat later Captain Scott says:

  John Wilson had progressed finely, and was now a full-fledged
  doctor, a healer of diseases, and a finder of stolen property
  through supernatural means. One day, while we were in his tent,
  a Wichita woman entered, led by the spirit. It was explained to
  us that she did not even know who lived there, but some force she
  could not account for brought her. Having stated her case to John,
  he went off into a fit of the jerks, in which his spirit went up
  and saw “his father” [i. e., God], who directed him how to cure
  this woman. When he came to, he explained the cure to her, and sent
  her away rejoicing. Soon afterwards a Keechei man came in, who was
  blind of one eye, and who desired to have the vision restored. John
  again consulted his father, who informed him that nothing could be
  done for that eye because that man held aloof from the dance.

While the author was visiting the Caddo on Sugar creek in the fall of
1893, John Wilson came down from his own camp to explain his part in
the Ghost dance. He wore a wide-brim hat, with his hair flowing down
to his shoulders, and on his breast, suspended from a cord about his
neck, was a curious amulet consisting of the polished end of a buffalo
horn, surrounded by a circlet of downy red feathers, within another
circle of badger and owl claws. He explained that this was the source
of his prophetic and clairvoyant inspiration. The buffalo horn was
“God’s heart,” the red feathers contained his own heart, and the circle
of claws represented the world. When he prayed for help, his heart
communed with “God’s heart,” and he learned what he wished to know. He
had much to say also of the moon. Sometimes in his trances he went to
the moon and the moon taught him secrets. It must be remembered that
sun, moon, stars, and almost every other thing in nature are considered
by the Indians as endowed with life and spirit. He claimed an intimate
acquaintance with the other world and asserted positively that he could
tell me “just what heaven is like.” Another man who accompanied him had
a yellow sun with green rays painted on his forehead, with an elaborate
rayed crescent in green, red, and yellow on his chin, and wore a
necklace from which depended a crucifix and a brass clock-wheel, the
latter, as he stated, representing the sun.

On entering the room where I sat awaiting him, Nĭshkû′ntŭ approached
and performed mystic passes in front of my face with his hands, after
the manner of the hypnotist priests in the Ghost dance, blowing upon me
the while, as he afterward explained to blow evil things away from me
before beginning to talk on religious subjects. He was good enough to
state also that he had prayed for light before coming, and had found
that my heart was good. Laying one hand on my head, and grasping my own
hand with the other, he prayed silently for some time with bowed head,
and then lifting his hand from my head, he passed it over my face, down
my shoulder and arm to the hand, which he grasped and pressed slightly,
and then released the fingers with a graceful upward sweep, as in the
minuet. The first part of this—the laying of the hands upon the head,
afterward drawing them down along the face and chest or arms—is the
regular Indian form of blessing, reverential gratitude, or prayerful
entreaty, and is of frequent occurrence in connection with the Ghost
dance, when the believers ask help of the priests or beg the prayers
of the older people. The next day about twenty or more Caddo came
by on their way to the agency, all dressed and painted for a dance
that was to be held that night. They stopped awhile to see us, and on
entering the room where we were the whole company, men, women, and
children, went through the same ceremony, with each one of the inmates
in turn, beginning with Wilson and myself, and ending with the members
of the family. The ceremony occupied a considerable time, and was at
once beautiful and impressive. Not a word was said by either party
during the while, excepting as someone in excess of devotion would
utter prayerful exclamations aloud like the undertone of a litany.
Every face wore a look of reverent solemnity, from the old men and
women down to little children of 6 and 8 years. Several of them, the
women especially, trembled while praying, as under the excitement of
the Ghost dance. The religious greeting being over, the women of the
family, with those of the party, went out to prepare the dinner, while
the rest remained to listen to the doctrinal discussion.

The Kiowa were predisposed to accept the doctrine of the Ghost dance.
No tribe had made more desperate resistance to the encroachments of
the whites upon their hunting grounds, and even after the failure of
the last effort of the confederated tribes in 1874–75, the Kiowa were
slow to accept the verdict of defeat. The result of this unsuccessful
struggle was to put an end to the boundless freedom of the prairie,
where they had roamed unquestioned from Dakota almost to central
Mexico, and henceforth the tribes were confined within the narrow
limits of reservations. Within five years the great southern buffalo
herd was extinct and the Indians found themselves at once prisoners and
paupers. The change was so swift and terrible in its effects that they
could not believe it real and final. It seemed to them like a dream of
sorrow, a supernatural cloud of darkness to punish their derelictions,
but which could be lifted from them by prayer and sacrifice. Their old
men told of years when the buffalo was scarce or had gone a long way
off, but never since the beginning of the world of a time when there
was no buffalo. The buffalo still lived beyond their horizon or in
caves under the earth, and with its return would come back prosperity
and freedom. Before we wonder at their faith we must remember that the
disappearance of these millions of buffalo in the space of a few years
has no parallel in the annals of natural history.

In 1881 a young Kiowa named Da′tekañ, “Keeps-his-name-always,” began to
“make medicine” to bring back the buffalo. He set up a sacred tipi, in
front of which he erected a pole with a buffalo skin at the top, and
made for himself a priestly robe of red color, trimmed with rows of
eagle feathers. Then standing in front of his tipi he called the people
around him and told them that he had been commanded and empowered in
a dream to bring back the buffalo, and if they observed strictly the
prayers and ceremonies which he enjoined the great herds would once
more cover the prairie. His hearers believed his words, promised strict
obedience, and gave freely of their blankets and other property to
reward his efforts in their behalf. Da′tekañ retired to his sacred
tipi, where, in his feathered robe of office, he continued to prophesy
and make buffalo medicine for a year, when he died without seeing the
realization of his hopes. The excitement caused by his predictions
came to the notice of the agent then in charge, who mentions it in his
annual report, without understanding the cause. On a Kiowa calendar
obtained by the author the event is recorded in a pictograph which
represents the medicine-man in his tipi, with his scarlet robe over his
shoulders and a buffalo beneath his feet (figure 84).

[Illustration: +Fig. 84+—Two Kiowa prophecies (from a Kiowa calendar).]

About six years later, in 1887, another prophet, named Pa′-iñgya, “In
the Middle,” revived the prophecy, claiming to be heir to all the
supernatural powers of his late predecessor. He amplified the doctrine
by asserting, logically enough, that as the whites were responsible
for the disappearance of the buffalo, the whites themselves would be
destroyed by the gods when the time was at hand for the return of
the buffalo. He preached also his own invulnerability and claimed the
power to kill with a look those who might offend him, as far as his
glance could reach. He fixed his headquarters on Elk creek, near the
western limit of the reservation, where he inaugurated a regular series
of ritual observances, under the management of ten chosen assistants.
Finally he announced that the time was at hand when the whites would
be removed and the buffalo would return. He ordered all the tribe to
assemble on Elk creek, where after four days he would bring down fire
from heaven which would destroy the agency, the schools, and the white
race, with the Indian unbelievers all together. The faithful need not
fear pursuit by the troops, for the soldiers who might follow would
wither before his glance and their bullets would have no effect on
the Indians. On the same Kiowa calendar this prediction is recorded
in another pictograph intended to represent flying bullets. The
whole Kiowa tribe caught the infection of his words. Every camp was
abandoned, parents took their children from the schools, and all fled
to the rendezvous on Elk creek. Here they waited patiently for their
deliverance till the predicted day came and passed without event, when
they returned with sadness to their camps and their government rations
of white man’s beef. Pa′-iñgya still lives, but the halo of prophecy no
longer surrounds him. To account for the disappointment he claimed that
his people had violated some of the ordinances and thereby postponed
the destined happiness. In this way their minds were kept dwelling on
the subject, and when at last the rumor of a messiah came from the
north he hailed it as the fulfillment of the prediction.

Early in the summer of 1890 the news of the advent of the messiah
reached the Kiowa, and in June of that year they sent a delegation of
about twenty men under the leadership of Pa′tadal, “Poor Buffalo,”
to Cheyenne and Arapaho agency at Darlington to learn more about the
matter. They brought back a favorable report and also a quantity of
the sacred red paint procured originally from the country of the
messiah. Soon after there was a great gathering of the Kiowa and Apache
at the agency at Anadarko to receive a payment of “grass money” due
from the cattlemen for the lease of pasturage on the reservation. On
this occasion the Ghost dance was formally inaugurated among the Kiowa,
Poor Buffalo assuming direction of the ceremony, and painting the
principal participants with the sacred red paint with his own hands.
The dance was carried back to their various camps and became a part of
the tribal life.

[Illustration: +Fig. 85+—Poor Buffalo.]

About this time a Sioux chief, High Wolf, came down from the north to
visit the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, and other tribes in that section.
He remained some time among them, and on his return to the north
invited a young Kiowa named Ä′piatañ, “Wooden Lance,” whose grandmother
had been a Sioux captive, to come up and visit his relatives at Pine
Ridge. The invitation was accepted by Ä′piatañ, partly for the pleasure
of seeing a new tribe and meeting his mother’s kindred, but chiefly
for the purpose of investigating for himself and for the Kiowa the
truth of the messiah story, Äpiatañ, who speaks but little English,
and who was then about 30 years of age, had recently lost a child to
whom he had been very much attached. He brooded over his loss until the
new doctrine came with its promise of a reunion with departed friends
and its possibility of seeing and talking with them in visions of the
trance. Moved by parental affection, which is the ruling passion with
an Indian, he determined on this long journey in search of the messiah,
who was vaguely reported to be somewhere in the north, to learn from
his own lips the wonderful story, and to see if it were possible to
talk again with his child. He discussed the matter with the chiefs,
who decided to send him as a delegate to find the messiah and learn
the truth or falsity of the reports, in order that the Kiowa might
be guided by the result on his return. A sufficient sum of money was
raised for his expenses, and he left for the north in September, 1890.
Almost the whole tribe had assembled at the agency to witness his
departure, and each in turn of the principal men performed over him a
ceremony of blessing, such as has already been described. His going and
return are both recorded on the calendar previously mentioned.

[Illustration: PL. CVI

  BI′ÄÑK̔I, THE KIOWA DREAMER]

In October, 1890, shortly after Ä′piatañ’s departure, Sitting Bull,
the Arapaho prophet of the Ghost dance, came down from his tribe
and gave new impetus to the excitement among the Kiowa. This event
also is recorded on the same Kiowa calendar in a well-drawn picture
representing a buffalo standing beside the figure of a man (figure
86). It is also indicated less definitely on another calendar obtained
from the tribe. Sitting Bull confirmed, as by personal knowledge, all
that had been told of the messiah, and predicted that the new earth
would arrive in the following spring, 1891. The Kiowa assembled on the
Washita, at the mouth of Rainy Mountain creek, and here, at the largest
Ghost dance ever held by the tribe, Sitting Bull consecrated seven
men and women as leaders of the dance and teachers of the doctrine by
giving to each one a sacred feather to be worn in the dance as the
badge of priesthood. Until the Ghost dance came to the prairie tribes
their women had never before been raised to such dignity as to be
allowed to wear feathers in their hair. After “giving the feather” to
the leaders thus chosen, they were taught the songs and ritual of the
dance. At first the songs were all in the Arapaho language, but after
the trances, which now began to be frequent, the Kiowa composed songs
of their own.

  calendar).]

Among the dreamers and prophets who now came to the front was one who
merits more than a passing notice. His original name was Bi′äñk̔i,
“Eater,” but on account of his frequent visits to the spirit world
he is now known as Äsa′tito′la, which maybe freely rendered “The
Messenger.” For a long time he had been in the habit of going alone
upon the mountain, there to fast and pray until visions came to
him, when he would return and give to his people the message of
inspiration. Frequently these vigils were undertaken at the request
of friends of sick people to obtain spiritual knowledge of the proper
remedies to be applied, or at the request of surviving relatives who
wished to hear from their departed friends in the other world. He
is now about 55 years of age, quiet and dignified in manner, with a
thoughtful cast of countenance which accords well with his character
as a priest and seer. His intellectual bent is further shown by the
fact that he has invented a system of ideographic writing which
is nearly as distinct from the ordinary Indian pictograph system
as it is from our own alphabet. It is based on the sign language
of the plains tribes, the primary effort being to convey the idea
by a pictured representation of the gesture sign; but, as in the
evolution of the alphabet, a part is frequently put for the whole,
and numerous arbitrary or auxiliary characters are added, until the
result is a well-developed germ of an alphabetic system. He has
taught the system to his sons, and by this means was able to keep up
a correspondence with them while they were attending Carlisle school.
It is unintelligible to the rest of the tribe. I have specimens of
this curious graphic method, obtained from the father and his sons,
which maybe treated at length at some future time. In the picture of
Äsa′tito′la (plate +CVI+), he holds in one hand a paper on which is
depicted one of his visions, while in the other is the pointer with
which he explains its meaning.

Plate +CVII+ herewith represents this vision. On this occasion, after
reaching the spirit world he found himself on a vast prairie covered
with herds of buffalo and ponies, represented respectively in the
picture by short black and green lines at the top. He went on through
the buffalo, the way being indicated by the dotted green lines, until
he came to a large Kiowa camp, in which, according to their old
custom, nearly every tipi had its distinctive style of painting or
ornamentation to show to what family it belonged, all these families
being still represented in the tribe. He went on to the point indicated
by the first heavy blue mark, where he met four young women, whom he
knew as having died years before, returning on horseback with their
saddle-pouches filled with wild plums. After some conversation he asked
them about two brothers, his relatives, who had died some time ago.
He went in the direction pointed out by the young women and soon met
the two young men coming into camp with a load of fresh buffalo meat
hung at their saddles. Their names were Emanki′na, “Can’t-hold-it,”
a policeman, and E′‛pea, “Afraid-of-him,” who had died while held as
a prisoner of war in Florida about fifteen years before. It will be
noted that they are represented in the picture as armed only with bows
and arrows, in agreement with the Ghost-dance doctrine of a return to
aboriginal things. After proceeding some distance he retraced his steps
and met two curious beings, represented in the picture by green figures
with crosses instead of heads. These told him to go on, and on
doing so he came to an immense circle of Kiowa dancing the Ghost dance
around a cedar tree, indicated by the black circle with a green figure
resembling a tree in the center. He stood for a while near the tree,
shown by another blue mark, when he saw a woman, whom he knew, leave
the dance. He hurried after her until she reached her own tipi and went
into it—shown by the blue mark beside the red tipi with red flags on
the ends of the tipi poles—when he turned around and came back. She
belonged to the family of the great chief Sett’aiñti, “White Bear,”
as indicated by the red tipi with red flags, no other warrior in the
tribe having such a tipi. On inquiring for his own relatives he was
directed to the other side of the camp, where he met a man—represented
by the heavy black mark—who told him his own people were inside of the
next tipi. On entering he found the whole family, consisting of his
father, two brothers, two sisters, and several children, feasting on
fresh buffalo beef from a kettle hung over the fire. They welcomed him
and offered him some of the meat, which for some reason he was afraid
to taste. To convince him that it was good they held it up for him to
smell, when he awoke and found himself lying alone upon the mountain.

  BIÄÑKI’S VISION.]

                   *       *       *       *       *

Ä′piatañ went on first to Pine Ridge, where he was well received by the
Sioux, who had much to say of the new messiah in the west. He was urged
to stop and join them in the Ghost dance, but refused and hurried on
to Fort Washakie, where he met the northern Arapaho and the Shoshoni,
whom he called the “northern Comanches.” Here the new prophecy was
the one topic of conversation, and after stopping only long enough
to learn the proper route to the Paiute country, he went on over the
Union Pacific railroad to Nevada. On arriving at the agency at Pyramid
lake the Paiute furnished him a wagon and an Indian guide across the
country to the home of Wovoka in the upper end of Mason valley. The
next day he was admitted to his presence. The result was a complete
disappointment. A single interview convinced him of the utter falsity
of the pretensions of the messiah and the deceptive character of the
hopes held out to the believers.

Saddened and disgusted, Ä′piatañ made no stay, but started at once
on his return home. On his way back he stopped at Bannock agency at
Fort Hall, Idaho, and from there sent a letter to his people, stating
briefly that he had seen the messiah and that the messiah was a fraud.
This was the first intimation the Kiowa had received from an Indian
source that their hopes were not well grounded. The author was present
when the letter was received at Anadarko and read to the assembled
Indians by Ä′piatañ’s sister, an educated woman named Laura Dunmoi,
formerly of Carlisle school. The result was a division of opinion.
Some of the Indians, feeling that the ground had been taken from under
them, at once gave up all hope and accepted the inevitable of despair.
Others were disposed to doubt the genuineness of the letter, as it had
come through the medium of a white man, and decided to withhold their
decision until they could hear directly from the delegate himself.
Ä′piatañ returned in the middle of February, 1891. The agent sent
notice to the various camps on the reservation for the Indians to
assemble at the agency to hear his report, and also sent a request to
Cheyenne and Arapaho agency to have Sitting Bull come down at the same
time so that the Indians might hear both sides of the story.

[Illustration: PL. CVIII

  KIOWA SUMMER SHELTER]

The council was held at the agency at Anadarko, Oklahoma, on February
19, 1891, the author being among those present on the occasion. It
was a great gathering, representing every tribe on the reservation,
there being also in attendance a number of Arapaho who had accompanied
Sitting Bull from the other agency. Everything said was interpreted
in turn into English, Kiowa, Comanche, Caddo, Wichita, and Arapaho.
This was a slow process, and necessitated frequent repetition, so that
the talk occupied all day. Ä′piatañ first made his report, which was
interpreted into the various languages. Questions were asked by the
agent, Mr Adams, and by leading Indians, and after the full details had
been obtained in this manner Sitting Bull, the Arapaho, was called on
to make his statement. The scene was dramatic in the highest degree.
Although in a certain sense Sitting Bull himself was on trial, it meant
more than that to the assembled tribe. Their power, prosperity, and
happiness had gone down, their very race was withering away before
the white man. The messiah doctrine promised a restoration of the old
conditions through supernatural assistance. If this hope was without
foundation, the Indian had no future and his day was forever past.

After some preliminaries Ä′piatañ arose and told his story. He had gone
on as related until he arrived at the home of Wovoka in Mason valley.
Here he was told that the messiah could not be seen until the next day.
On being finally admitted to his presence he found him lying down,
his face covered with a blanket, and singing to himself. When he had
finished the song the messiah uncovered his face and asked Ä′piatañ,
through an interpreter, what he wanted. As Ä′piatañ had approached with
great reverence under the full belief that the messiah was omniscient,
able to read his secret thoughts and to speak all languages, this
question was a great surprise to him, and his faith at once began to
waver. However, he told who he was and why he had come, and then asked
that he be permitted to see some of his dead relatives, particularly
his little child. Wovoka replied that this was impossible, and that
there were no spirits there to be seen. With their mixture of Christian
and aboriginal ideas many of the Indians had claimed that this messiah
was the veritable Christ and bore upon his hands and feet the scars
of the crucifixion. Not seeing these scars, Ä′piatañ expressed some
doubt as to whether Wovoka was really the messiah he had come so far to
see, to which Wovoka replied that he need go no farther for there was
no other messiah, and went on to say that he had preached to Sitting
Bull and the others and had given them a new dance, but that some of
them, especially the Sioux, had twisted things and made trouble, and
now Ä′piatañ had better go home and tell his people to quit the whole
business. Discouraged and sick at heart Ä′piatañ went out from his
presence, convinced that there was no longer a god in Israel.

After the story had been told and interpreted to each of the tribes,
Sitting Bull was called on for his statement. He told how he had
visited the messiah a year before and what the messiah had said
to him. The two versions were widely different, and there can be
little question that Wovoka made claims and prophecies, supported
by hypnotic performances, from which he afterward receded when he
found that the excitement had gone beyond his control and resulted
in an Indian outbreak. Sitting Bull insisted on the truth of his own
representations, and when accused by Ä′piatañ of deceiving the Indians
in order to obtain their property he replied that he had never asked
them for the ponies which they had given him, and that if they did not
believe what he had told them they could come and take their ponies
again. Ä′piatañ replied that that was not the Kiowa road; what had once
been given was not taken back. Sitting Bull spoke in a low musical
voice, and the soft Arapaho syllables contrasted pleasantly with the
choking sounds of the Kiowa and the boisterous loudness of the Wichita.
I could not help a feeling of pity for him when at the close of the
council he drew his blanket around him and went out from the gathering
to cross the river to the Caddo camp, attended only by his faithful
Arapahos. For his services in reporting against the dance Ä′piatañ
received a medal from President Harrison.

This was for some time the end of the Ghost dance among the Kiowa, for
while some few of the tribes were disposed to doubt the honesty or
correctness of the report, the majority accepted it as final, and from
that time the dance became a mere amusement for children. The other
tribes, however—the Caddo, Wichita, and their allies—refused to accept
the report, claiming that Ä′piatañ had been hired by white men to lie
to the Indians, and that he had never really seen the messiah, as he
claimed. Even the Apache, although in close tribal connection with the
Kiowa, continued to hold to the doctrine and the dance.

                   *       *       *       *       *

+Note.+—Since the above was written and while awaiting publication
there has been a revival of the Ghost dance among the Kiowa, brought
about chiefly through the efforts of Bi′äñk̔i, Pa′tadal, and others
of its former priests. After several times dispersing the dancers and
threatening them with severe penalties if they persisted, the agent
was finally obliged to give permission, on the earnest request of a
delegation of chiefs and head men of the tribe, with the result that
in September, 1894, the Kiowa publicly revived the ceremony in a great
dance on the Washita, which lasted four days and was attended by
several thousand Indians from all the surrounding tribes.

  GHOST DANCE PAINTING ON BUCKSKIN]

                       EXPLANATION OF PLATE CIX.

  The original of this picture was drawn in colored inks on buckskin
  by Yellow Nose, a Ute captive among the Cheyenne, in 1891. It
  was obtained from him by the author and is now deposited in the
  National Museum at Washington. Besides being a particularly fine
  specimen of Indian pictography, it gives an excellent idea of the
  ghost dance as it was at that time among the Cheyenne and Arapaho.
  The dancers are in full costume, with paint and feathers. The women
  of the two tribes are plainly distinguished by the arrangement
  of their hair, the Cheyenne women having the hair braided at the
  side, while the Arapaho women wear it hanging loosely. Two of the
  women carry children on their backs. One of the men carries the
  _bä′qati_ wheel, another a shinny stick, and a woman holds out
  the sacred crow, while several wave handkerchiefs which aid in
  producing the hypnotic effect. In the center are several persons
  with arms outstretched and rigid, while at one side is seen the
  medicine-man hypnotizing a subject who stretches out toward him
  a blue handkerchief. The spotted object on the ground behind the
  medicine-man is a shawl which has fallen from the shoulders of the
  woman standing near.




                             +Chapter XV+

                    THE CEREMONY OF THE GHOST DANCE


In chapter +XI+ we have spoken of the Ghost dance as it existed among
the Paiute, Shoshoni, Walapai, and Cohonino, west of the mountains. We
shall now give a more detailed account of the ceremony and connected
ritual among the prairie tribes.


                      AMONG THE NORTHERN CHEYENNE

According to Dr Grinnell the Ghost dance among the northern Cheyenne
had several features not found in the south. Four fires were built
outside of the dance circle and about 20 yards back from it, toward
each of the cardinal points. These fires were built of long poles set
up on end, so as to form a rude cone, much as the poles of a tipi are
erected. The fires were lighted at the bottom, and thus made high
bonfires, which were kept up as long as the dance continued. (_J. F.
L., 5._)


                            AMONG THE SIOUX

Perhaps the most important feature in connection with the dance among
the Sioux was the “ghost shirt,” already noticed and to be described
more fully hereafter. On account of the scarcity of buckskin, these
shirts were almost always made of white cloth cut and figured in the
Indian fashion. The Sioux wore no metal of any kind in the dance,
differing in this respect from the southern tribes, who wore on such
occasions all their finery of German silver ornaments. The Sioux also
began the dance sometimes in the morning, as well as in the afternoon
or evening. Another important feature not found among the southern
tribes, excepting the Kiowa, was the tree planted in the center of the
circle and decorated with feathers, stuffed animals, and strips of
cloth.

At a Ghost dance at No Water’s camp, near Pine Ridge, as described by
J. F. Asay, formerly a trader at the agency, the dancers first stood
in line facing the sun, while the leader, standing facing them, made a
prayer and waved over their heads the “ghost stick,” a staff about 6
feet long, trimmed with red cloth and feathers of the same color. After
thus waving the stick over them, he faced the sun and made another
prayer, after which the line closed up to form a circle around the
tree and the dance began. During the prayer a woman standing near the
tree held out a pipe toward the sun, while another beside her held
out several (four?) arrows from which the points had been removed.
On another occasion, at a Ghost dance at the same camp, four arrows,
headed with bone in the olden fashion, were shot up into the air from
the center of the circle and afterward gathered up and hung upon the
tree, together with the bow, a gaming wheel and sticks, and a staff
of peculiar shape (ghost stick?). See plate +CXI+. The ceremonies of
fasting, painting, and the sweat-bath in connection with the Ghost
dance among the Sioux have been already described.

The best account of the dance itself and of the ghost shirt is given by
Mrs Z. A. Parker, at that time a teacher on the Pine Ridge reservation,
writing of a Ghost dance observed by her on White Clay creek, on June
20, 1890. We quote at length from her description:

  We drove to this spot about 10.30 oclock on a delightful October
  day. We came upon tents scattered here and there in low, sheltered
  places long before reaching the dance ground. Presently we saw
  over three hundred tents placed in a circle, with a large pine
  tree in the center, which was covered with strips of cloth of
  various colors, eagle feathers, stuffed birds, claws, and horns—all
  offerings to the Great Spirit. The ceremonies had just begun. In
  the center, around the tree, were gathered their medicine-men; also
  those who had been so fortunate as to have had visions and in them
  had seen and talked with friends who had died. A company of fifteen
  had started a chant and were marching abreast, others coming in
  behind as they marched. After marching around the circle of tents
  they turned to the center, where many had gathered and were seated
  on the ground.

  I think they wore the ghost shirt or ghost dress for the first
  time that day. I noticed that these were all new and were worn
  by about seventy men and forty women. The wife of a man called
  Return-from-scout had seen in a vision that her friends all wore a
  similar robe, and on reviving from her trance she called the women
  together and they made a great number of the sacred garments. They
  were of white cotton cloth. The women’s dress was cut like their
  ordinary dress, a loose robe with wide, flowing sleeves, painted
  blue in the neck, in the shape of a three-cornered handkerchief,
  with moon, stars, birds, etc, interspersed with real feathers,
  painted on the waist and sleeves. While dancing they wound their
  shawls about their waists, letting them fall to within 3 inches
  of the ground, the fringe at the bottom. In the hair, near the
  crown, a feather was tied. I noticed an absence of any manner of
  bead ornaments, and, as I knew their vanity and fondness for them,
  wondered why it was. Upon making inquiries I found they discarded
  everything they could which was made by white men.

  The ghost shirt for the men was made of the same material—shirts
  and leggings painted in red. Some of the leggings were painted
  in stripes running up and down, others running around. The shirt
  was painted blue around the neck, and the whole garment was
  fantastically sprinkled with figures of birds, bows and arrows,
  sun, moon, and stars, and everything they saw in nature. Down the
  outside of the sleeve were rows of feathers tied by the quill ends
  and left to fly in the breeze, and also a row around the neck and
  up and down the outside of the leggings. I noticed that a number
  had stuffed birds, squirrel heads, etc, tied in their long hair.
  The faces of all were painted red with a black half-moon on the
  forehead or on one cheek.

  As the crowd gathered about the tree the high priest, or master of
  ceremonies, began his address, giving them directions as to the
  chant and other matters. After he had spoken for about fifteen
  minutes they arose and formed in a circle. As nearly as I could
  count, there were between three and four hundred persons. One stood
  directly behind another, each with his hands on his neighbor’s
  shoulders. After walking about a few times, chanting, “Father, I
  come,” they stopped marching, but remained in the circle, and
  set up the most fearful, heart-piercing wails I ever heard—crying,
  moaning, groaning, and shrieking out their grief, and naming over
  their departed friends and relatives, at the same time taking up
  handfuls of dust at their feet, washing their hands in it, and
  throwing it over their heads. Finally, they raised their eyes to
  heaven, their hands clasped high above their heads, and stood
  straight and perfectly still, invoking the power of the Great
  Spirit to allow them to see and talk with their people who had
  died. This ceremony lasted about fifteen minutes, when they all
  sat down where they were and listened to another address, which I
  did not understand, but which I afterwards learned were words of
  encouragement and assurance of the coming messiah.

  SACRED OBJECTS FROM THE SIOUX GHOST DANCE]

  When they arose again, they enlarged the circle by facing toward
  the center, taking hold of hands, and moving around in the manner
  of school children in their play of “needle’s eye.” And now the
  most intense excitement began. They would go as fast as they could,
  their hands moving from side to side, their bodies swaying, their
  arms, with hands gripped tightly in their neighbors’, swinging
  back and forth with all their might. If one, more weak and frail,
  came near falling, he would be jerked up and into position until
  tired nature gave way. The ground had been worked and worn by many
  feet, until the fine, flour-like dust lay light and loose to the
  depth of two or three inches. The wind, which had increased, would
  sometimes take it up, enveloping the dancers and hiding them from
  view. In the ring were men, women, and children; the strong and the
  robust, the weak consumptive, and those near to death’s door. They
  believed those who were sick would be cured by joining in the dance
  and losing consciousness. From the beginning they chanted, to a
  monotonous tune, the words—

        Father, I come;
        Mother, I come;
        Brother, I come;
        Father, give us back our arrows.

  All of which they would repeat over and over again until first one
  and then another would break from the ring and stagger away and
  fall down. One woman fell a few feet from me. She came toward us,
  her hair flying over her face, which was purple, looking as if
  the blood would burst through; her hands and arms moving wildly;
  every breath a pant and a groan; and she fell on her back, and went
  down like a log. I stepped up to her as she lay there motionless,
  but with every muscle twitching and quivering. She seemed to be
  perfectly unconscious. Some of the men and a few of the women would
  run, stepping high and pawing the air in a frightful manner. Some
  told me afterwards that they had a sensation as if the ground were
  rising toward them and would strike them in the face. Others would
  drop where they stood. One woman fell directly into the ring, and
  her husband stepped out and stood over her to prevent them from
  trampling upon her. No one ever disturbed those who fell or took
  any notice of them except to keep the crowd away.

  They kept up dancing until fully 100 persons were lying
  unconscious. Then they stopped and seated themselves in a circle,
  and as each one recovered from his trance he was brought to the
  center of the ring to relate his experience. Each told his story
  to the medicine-man and he shouted it to the crowd. Not one in ten
  claimed that he saw anything. I asked one Indian—a tall, strong
  fellow, straight as an arrow—what his experience was. He said he
  saw an eagle coming toward him. It flew round and round, drawing
  nearer and nearer until he put out his hand to take it, when it was
  gone. I asked him what he thought of it. “Big lie,” he replied. I
  found by talking to them that not one in twenty believed it. After
  resting for a time they would go through the same performance,
  perhaps three times a day. They practiced fasting, and every
  morning those who joined in the dance were obliged to immerse
  themselves in the creek. (_Comr., 44._)


                            SONG REHEARSALS

As with church choirs, the leaders, both men and women, frequently
assembled privately in a tipi to rehearse the new or old songs for
the next dance. During the first winter spent among the Arapaho I had
frequent opportunity of being present at these rehearsals, as for a
long time the snow was too deep to permit dancing outside. After having
obtained their confidence the Arapaho police invited me to come up to
their camp at night to hear them practice the songs in anticipation of
better weather for dancing. Thenceforth rehearsals were held in Black
Coyote’s tipi almost every night until the snow melted, each session
usually lasting about three hours.

On these occasions from eight to twelve persons were present, sitting
in a circle on the low beds around the fire in the center. Black
Coyote acted as master of ceremonies and opened proceedings by filling
and lighting the redstone pipe, offering the first whiff to the sun,
then reversing the stem in offering to the earth, next presenting
the pipe to the fire, and then to each of the four cardinal points.
He then took a few puffs himself, after which he passed the pipe to
his next neighbor, who went through the same preliminaries before
smoking, and thus the pipe went round the circle, each one taking only
a few puffs before passing it on. The pipe was then put back into its
pouch, and Black Coyote, standing with his face toward the northwest,
the messiah’s country, with eyes closed and arms outstretched, made
a fervent prayer for help and prosperity to his tribe, closing with
an earnest petition to the messiah to hasten his coming. The others
listened in silence with bowed heads. The prayer ended, they consulted
as to the song to be sung first, which Black Coyote then started in a
clear musical bass, the others joining. From time to time explanations
were made where the meaning of the song was not clear. They invited
me to call for whatever songs I wished to hear, and these songs were
repeated over and over again to give me an opportunity to write them
down, but they waived extended discussion until another time. Usually
the men alone were the singers, but sometimes Black Coyote’s wives or
other women who were present joined in the songs. It was noticeable
that even in these rehearsals the women easily fell under the
excitement of the dance. Finally, about 10 oclock, all rose together
and sang the closing song, _Ni′ninitubi′na Huhu_, “The Crow has given
the signal,” and the rehearsal was at an end. On one occasion, before
I had obtained this song, I called for it in order that I might write
it down, but they explained that we must wait awhile, as it was the
closing song, and if they sung it then they must quit for the night.


                      PREPARATIONS FOR THE DANCE

On several occasions the dance ground was consecrated before the
performance, one of the leaders going all about the place, sprinkling
some kind of sacred powder over the ground and praying the while.

[Illustration: PL. CXI

  SACRED OBJECTS FROM THE SIOUX GHOST DANCE

  _a_, Staff; _b_, _c_, Bow and bone-head arrows; _d_, Gaming wheel
  and sticks]

Frequently in the dance one or more of the leaders while sitting within
the circle would beat upon the earth with his extended palm, then lay
his hand upon his head, afterward blow into his hand, and then repeat
the operation, praying all the time. Sometimes the hypnotist would beat
the ground in the same way and then lay his hand on the head of the
subject (plate +CXV+). No satisfactory explanation of this ceremony
was obtained beyond the general idea that the earth, like the sun, the
fire, and the water, is sacred.


                          GIVING THE FEATHER

The ceremony of “giving the feather” has been already noticed. This was
an official ordination of the priests in the dance, conferred on them
by the apostle who first brought the ceremony to the tribe. Among the
Arapaho, Caddo, Kiowa, and adjoining tribes in the south the feather
was conferred by Sitting Bull himself. The feather was thus given
to seven leaders, or sometimes to fourteen, that is, seven men and
seven women, the number seven being sacred with most tribes and more
particularly in the Ghost dance. The feather, which was worn upon the
head of the dancers, was either that of the crow, the sacred bird of
the Ghost dance, or of the eagle, sacred in all Indian religions. If
from the crow, two feathers were used, being attached at a slight angle
to a small stick which was thrust into the hair. (See Arapaho song 8.)
The feathers were previously consecrated by the priest with prayer and
ceremony. The chosen ones usually reciprocated with presents of ponies,
blankets, or other property. After having thus received the feather
the tribe began to make songs of its own, having previously used those
taught them by the apostle from his own language.

Besides the seven leaders who wear the sacred crow feathers as emblems
of their leadership, nearly all the dancers wear feathers variously
painted and ornamented, and the preparation of these is a matter of
much concern. The dancer who desires instruction on this point usually
takes with him six friends, so as to make up the sacred number of
seven, and goes with them to one who has been in a trance and has thus
learned the exact method in vogue in the spirit world. At their request
this man prepares for each one a feather, according to what he has seen
in some trance vision, for which they return thanks, usually with a
small present. The feathers are painted in several colors, each larger
feather usually being tipped with a small down feather painted in a
different color. On certain occasions a special day is set apart for
publicly painting and preparing the feathers for all the dancers, the
work being done by the appointed leaders of the ceremony.


                      THE PAINTING OF THE DANCERS

The painting of the dancers is done with the same ceremonial exactness
of detail, each design being an inspiration from a trance vision.
Usually the dancer adopts the particular style of painting which,
while in the trance, he has seen worn by some departed relative. If he
has not yet been in a trance, the design is suggested by a vision of
one who does the painting. In making the request the dancer lays his
hands upon the head of the leader and says, “My father, I have come to
be painted, so that I may see my friends; have pity on me and paint
me,” the sacred paint being held to sharpen the spiritual vision as
well as to be conducive to physical health. The painting consists of
elaborate designs in red, yellow, green, and blue upon the face, with
a red or yellow line along the parting of the hair. Suns, crescents,
stars, crosses, and birds (crows) are the designs in most common use.


                             THE CEREMONY

The dance commonly begins about the middle of the afternoon or later,
after sundown. When it begins in the afternoon, there is always an
intermission of an hour or two for supper. The announcement is made
by the criers, old men who assume this office apparently by tacit
understanding, who go about the camp shouting in a loud voice to the
people to prepare for the dance. The preliminary painting and dressing
is usually a work of about two hours. When all is ready, the leaders
walk out to the dance place, and facing inward, join hands so as to
form a small circle. Then, without moving from their places they sing
the opening song, according to previous agreement, in a soft undertone.
Having sung it through once they raise their voices to their full
strength and repeat it, this time slowly circling around in the dance.
The step is different from that of most other Indian dances, but very
simple, the dancers moving from right to left, following the course
of the sun, advancing the left foot and following it with the right,
hardly lifting the feet from the ground. For this reason it is called
by the Shoshoni the “dragging dance.” All the songs are adapted to
the simple measure of the dance step. As the song rises and swells
the people come singly and in groups from the several tipis, and one
after another joins the circle until any number from fifty to five
hundred men, women, and children are in the dance. When the circle is
small, each song is repeated through a number of circuits. If large,
it is repeated only through one circuit, measured by the return of the
leaders to the starting point. Each song is started in the same manner,
first in an undertone while the singers stand still in their places,
and then with full voice as they begin to circle around. At intervals
between the songs, more especially after the trances have begun, the
dancers unclasp hands and sit down to smoke or talk for a few minutes.
At such times the leaders sometimes deliver short addresses or sermons,
or relate the recent trance experience of the dancer. In holding each
other’s hands the dancers usually intertwine the fingers instead of
grasping the hand as with us. Only an Indian could keep the blanket
in place as they do under such circumstances. Old people hobbling
along with sticks, and little children hardly past the toddling period
sometimes form a part of the circle, the more vigorous dancers
accommodating the movement to their weakness. Frequently a woman will
be seen to join the circle with an infant upon her back and dance
with the others, but should she show the least sign of approaching
excitement watchful friends lead her away that no harm may come to the
child. Dogs are driven off from the neighborhood of the circle lest
they should run against any of those who have fallen into a trance and
thus awaken them. The dancers themselves are careful not to disturb the
trance subjects while their souls are in the spirit world. Full Indian
dress is worn, with buckskin, paint, and feathers, but among the Sioux
the women discarded the belts ornamented with disks of German silver,
because the metal had come from the white man. Among the southern
tribes, on the contrary, hats were sometimes worn in the dance,
although this was not considered in strict accordance with the doctrine.

  THE GHOST DANCE—SMALL CIRCLE]

No drum, rattle, or other musical instrument is used in the dance,
excepting sometimes by an individual dancer in imitation of a trance
vision. In this respect particularly the Ghost dance differs from every
other Indian dance. Neither are any fires built within the circle,
so far as known, with any tribe excepting the Walapai. The northern
Cheyenne, however, built four fires in a peculiar fashion outside
of the circle, as already described. With most tribes the dance was
performed around a tree or pole planted in the center and variously
decorated. In the southern plains, however, only the Kiowa seem ever to
have followed this method, they sometimes dancing around a cedar tree.
On breaking the circle at the end of the dance the performers shook
their blankets or shawls in the air, with the idea of driving away
all evil influences. On later instructions from the messiah all then
went down to bathe in the stream, the men in one place and the women
in another, before going to their tipis. The idea of washing away evil
things, spiritual as well as earthly, by bathing in running water is
too natural and universal to need comment.

The peculiar ceremonies of prayer and invocation, with the laying on of
hands and the stroking of the face and body, have several times been
described and need only be mentioned here. As trance visions became
frequent the subjects strove to imitate what they had seen in the
spirit world, especially where they had taken part with their departed
friends in some of the old-time games. In this way gaming wheels,
shinny sticks, hummers, and other toys or implements would be made and
carried in future dances, accompanied with appropriate songs, until
the dance sometimes took on the appearance of an exhibition of Indian
curios on a small scale.


                            THE CROW DANCE

Within the last few years the southern Arapaho and Cheyenne have
developed an auxiliary dance called the “crow dance,” which is
performed in the afternoon as a preliminary to the regular Ghost
dance at night. As it is no part of the original Ghost dance and is
confined to these two tribes, it deserves no extended notice in this
connection. Although claimed by its inventors as a direct inspiration
from the other world, where they saw it performed by “crows,” or
spirits of departed friends, it is really only a modification of the
picturesque Omaha dance of the prairie tribes, with the addition
of religious features borrowed from the new doctrine. The men
participating are stripped to the breechcloth, with their whole
bodies painted as in the Omaha dance, and wear elaborate pendants of
varicolored feathers hanging down behind from the waist. An immense
drum is an important feature. Men and women take part, and the songs
refer to the general subject of the crow and the messiah, but are set
to a variety of dance steps and evolutions performed by the dancers.
As the leaders, who are chiefly young men, are constantly studying
new features, the crow dance has become one of the most attractive
ceremonies among the prairie tribes. Hypnotism and trances form an
essential feature of this as of the Ghost dance proper. (See plate
+CXIX+.)


                         THE HYPNOTIC PROCESS

The most important feature of the Ghost dance, and the secret of the
trances, is hypnotism. It has been hastily assumed that hypnotic
knowledge and ability belong only to an overripe civilization, such
as that of India and ancient Egypt, or to the most modern period
of scientific investigation. The fact is, however, that practical
knowledge, if not understanding, of such things belongs to people who
live near to nature, and many of the stories told by reliable travelers
of the strange performances of savage shamans can be explained only
on this theory. Numerous references in the works of the early Jesuit
missionaries, of the Puritan writers of New England, and of English
explorers farther to the south, would indicate that hypnotic ability no
less than sleight-of-hand dexterity formed part of the medicine-man’s
equipment from the Saint Lawrence to the Gulf. Enough has been said in
the chapters on Smoholla and the Shakers to show that hypnotism exists
among the tribes of the Columbia, and the author has had frequent
opportunity to observe and study it in the Ghost dance on the plains.
It can not be said that the Indian priests understand the phenomenon,
for they ascribe it to a supernatural cause, but they know how to
produce the effect, as I have witnessed hundreds of times. In treating
of the subject in connection with the Ghost dance the author must be
understood as speaking from the point of view of an observer and not as
a psychologic expert.

Immediately on coming among the Arapaho and Cheyenne in 1890, I heard
numerous stories of wonderful things that occurred in the Ghost
dance—how people died, went to heaven and came back again, and how
they talked with dead friends and brought back messages from the other
world. Quite a number who had thus “died” were mentioned and their
adventures in the spirit land were related with great particularity
of detail, but as most of the testimony came from white men, none
of whom had seen the dance for themselves, I preserved the scientific
attitude of skepticism. So far as could be ascertained, none of the
intelligent people of the agency had thought the subject sufficiently
worthy of serious consideration to learn whether the reports were true
or false. On talking with the Indians I found them unanimous in their
statements as to the visions, until I began to think there might be
something in it.

[Illustration: PL. CXIII

  THE GHOST DANCE—LARGER CIRCLE]

The first clue to the explanation came from the statement of his own
experience in the trance, given by Paul Boynton, a particularly bright
Carlisle student, who acted as my interpreter. His brother had died
some time before, and as Paul was anxious to see and talk with him,
which the new doctrine taught was possible, he attended the next Ghost
dance, and putting his hands upon the head of Sitting Bull, according
to the regular formula, asked him to help him see his dead brother.
Paul is of an inquiring disposition, and, besides his natural longing
to meet his brother again, was actuated, as he himself said, by a
desire to try “every Indian trick.” He then told how Sitting Bull had
hypnotized him with the eagle feather and the motion of his hands,
until he fell unconscious and did really see his brother, but awoke
just as he was about to speak to him, probably because one of the
dancers had accidentally brushed against him as he lay on the ground.
He embodied his experience in a song which was afterward sung in the
dance. From his account it seemed almost certain that the secret was
hypnotism. The explanation might have occurred to me sooner but for
the fact that my previous Indian informants, after the manner of some
other witnesses, had told only about their trance visions, forgetting
to state how the visions were brought about.

This was in winter and the ground was covered deeply with snow, which
stopped the dancing for several weeks. In the meantime I improved the
opportunity by visiting the tipis every night to learn the songs and
talk about the new religion. When the snow melted, the dances were
renewed, and as by this time I had gained the confidence of the Indians
I was invited to be present and thereafter on numerous occasions was
able to watch the whole process by which the trances were produced.
From the outside hardly anything can be seen of what goes on within
the circle, but being a part of the circle myself I was able to see
all that occurred inside, and by fixing attention on one subject at a
time I was able to note all the stages of the phenomenon from the time
the subject first attracted the notice of the medicine-man, through
the staggering, the rigidity, the unconsciousness, and back again to
wakefulness. On two occasions my partner in the dance, each time a
woman, came under the influence and I was thus enabled to note the
very first nervous tremor of her hand and mark it as it increased in
violence until she broke away and staggered toward the medicine-man
within the circle.

Young women are usually the first to be affected, then older women,
and lastly men. Sometimes, however, a man proves as sensitive as the
average woman. In particular I have seen one young Arapaho become
rigid in the trance night after night. He was a Carlisle student,
speaking good English and employed as clerk in a store. He afterward
took part in the sun dance, dancing three days and nights without food,
drink, or sleep. He is of a quiet, religious disposition, and if of
white parentage would perhaps have become a minister, but being an
Indian, the same tendency leads him into the Ghost dance and the sun
dance. The fact that he could endure the terrible ordeal of the sun
dance would go to show that his physical organization is not frail,
as is frequently the case with hypnotic or trance subjects. So far as
personal observation goes, the hypnotic subjects are usually as strong
and healthy as the average of their tribe. It seems to be a question
more of temperament than of bodily condition or physique. After having
observed the Ghost dance among the southern tribes at intervals during
a period of about four years, it is apparent that the hypnotic tendency
is growing, although the original religious excitement is dying out.
The trances are now more numerous among the same number of dancers.
Some begin to tremble and stagger almost at the beginning of the dance,
without any effort on the part of the medicine-man, while formerly it
was usually late in the night before the trances began, although the
medicine-men were constantly at work to produce such result. In many
if not in most cases the medicine-men themselves have been in trances
produced in the same fashion, and must thus be considered sensitives as
well as those hypnotized by them.

Not every leader in the Ghost dance is able to bring about the hypnotic
sleep, but anyone may try who feels so inspired. Excepting the seven
chosen ones who start the songs there is no priesthood in the dance,
the authority of such men as Sitting Bull and Black Coyote being due
to the voluntary recognition of their superior ability or interest in
the matter. Any man or woman who has been in a trance, and has thus
derived inspiration from the other world, is at liberty to go within
the circle and endeavor to bring others to the trance. Even when the
result is unsatisfactory there is no interference with the performer,
it being held that he is but the passive instrument of a higher power
and therefore in no way responsible. A marked instance of this is the
case of Cedar Tree, an Arapaho policeman, who took much interest in
the dance, attending nearly every performance in his neighborhood,
consecrating the ground and working within the circle to hypnotize
the dancers. He was in an advanced stage of consumption, nervous and
excitable to an extreme degree, and perhaps it was for this reason that
those who came under his influence in the trance constantly complained
that he led them on the “devil’s road” instead of the “straight road;”
that he made them see monstrous and horrible shapes, but never the
friends whom they wished to see. On this account they all dreaded to
see him at work within the circle, but no one commanded him to desist
as it was held that he was controlled by a stronger power and was to be
pitied rather than blamed for his ill success. A similar idea exists
in Europe in connection with persons reputed to possess the evil eye.
Cedar Tree himself deplored the result of his efforts and expressed the
hope that by earnest prayer he might finally be able to overcome the
evil influence.

[Illustration: PL. CXIV

  THE GHOST DANCE—LARGE CIRCLE]

We shall now describe the hypnotic process as used by the operators,
with the various stages of the trance. The hypnotist, usually a man,
stands within the ring, holding in his hand an eagle feather or a
scarf or handkerchief, white, black, or of any other color. Sometimes
he holds the feather in one hand and the scarf in the other. As the
dancers circle around singing the songs in time with the dance step
the excitement increases until the more sensitive ones are visibly
affected. In order to hasten the result certain songs are sung to
quicker time, notably the Arapaho song beginning _Nû′nanû′naatani′na
Hu′hu_. We shall assume that the subject is a woman. The first
indication that she is becoming affected is a slight muscular tremor,
distinctly felt by her two partners who hold her hands on either side.
The medicine-man is on the watch, and as soon as he notices the woman’s
condition he comes over and stands immediately in front of her, looking
intently into her face and whirling the feather or the handkerchief,
or both, rapidly in front of her eyes, moving slowly around with the
dancers at the same time, but constantly facing the woman. All this
time he keeps up a series of sharp exclamations, Hu! Hu! Hu! like the
rapid breathing of an exhausted runner. From time to time he changes
the motion of the feather or handkerchief from a whirling to a rapid
up-and-down movement in front of her eyes. For a while the woman
continues to move around with the circle of dancers, singing the song
with the others, but usually before the circuit is completed she loses
control of herself entirely, and, breaking away from the partners
who have hold of her hands on either side, she staggers into the
ring, while the circle at once closes up again behind her. She is now
standing before the medicine-man, who gives his whole attention to her,
whirling the feather swiftly in front of her eyes, waving his hands
before her face as though fanning her, and drawing his hand slowly from
the level of her eyes away to one side or upward into the air, while
her gaze follows it with a fixed stare. All the time he keeps up the
Hu! Hu! Hu! while the song and the dance go on around them without a
pause. For a few minutes she continues to repeat the words of the song
and keep time with the step, but in a staggering, drunken fashion. Then
the words become unintelligible sounds, and her movements violently
spasmodic, until at last she becomes rigid, with her eyes shut or
fixed and staring, and stands thus uttering low pitiful moans (plate
+CXVII+). If this is in the daytime, the operator tries to stand with
his back to the sun, so that the full sunlight shines in the woman’s
face (plate +CXVI+). The subject may retain this fixed, immovable
posture for an indefinite time, but at last falls heavily to the
ground, unconscious and motionless (plate +CXVIII+). The dance and the
song never stop, but as soon as the woman falls the medicine-man gives
his attention to another subject among the dancers. The first one may
lie unconscious for ten or twenty minutes or sometimes for hours, but
no one goes near to disturb her, as her soul is now communing with the
spirit world. At last consciousness gradually returns. A violent tremor
seizes her body as in the beginning of the fit. A low moan comes from
her lips, and she sits up and looks about her like one awaking from
sleep. Her whole form trembles violently, but at last she rises to her
feet and staggers away from the dancers, who open the circle to let her
pass. All the phenomena of recovery, except rigidity, occur in direct
reverse of those which precede unconsciousness.

Sometimes before falling the hypnotized subject runs wildly around
the circle or out over the prairie, or goes through various crazy
evolutions like those of a lunatic. On one occasion—but only once—I
have seen the medicine-man point his finger almost in the face of the
hypnotized subject, and then withdrawing his finger describe with it
a large circle about the tipis. The subject followed the direction
indicated, sometimes being hidden from view by the crowd, and finally
returned, with his eyes still fixed and staring, to the place where
the medicine-man was standing. There is frequently a good deal of
humbug mixed with these performances, some evidently pretending to
be hypnotized in order to attract notice or to bring about such
a condition from force of imitation, but the greater portion is
unquestionably genuine and beyond the control of the subjects. In many
instances the hypnotized person spins around for minutes at a time like
a dervish, or whirls the arms with apparently impossible speed, or
assumes and retains until the final fall most uncomfortable positions
which it would be impossible to keep for any length of time under
normal conditions. Frequently a number of persons are within the ring
at once, in all the various stages of hypnotism. The proportion of
women thus affected is about three times that of men.


                     THE AREA COVERED BY THE DANCE

It is impossible to give more than an approximate statement as to
the area of the Ghost dance and the messiah doctrine and the number
of Indians involved. According to the latest official report, there
are about 146,000 Indians west of Missouri river, exclusive of the
five civilized nations in Indian Territory. Probably all these tribes
heard of the new doctrine, but only a part took any active interest
in it. Generally speaking, it was never taken up by the great tribe
of the Navaho, by any of the Pueblos except the Taos, or by any of
the numerous tribes of the Columbia region. The thirty or thirty-five
tribes more or less concerned with the dance have an aggregate
population of about 60,000 souls. A number of these were practically
unanimous in their acceptance of the new doctrine, notably the Paiute,
Shoshoni, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Caddo, and Pawnee, while of others, as
the Comanche, only a small minority ever engaged in it. Only about
one-half of the 26,000 Sioux took an active part in it. It may safely
be said, however, that the doctrine and ceremony of the Ghost dance
found more adherents among our tribes than any similar Indian religious
movement within the historic period, with the single possible exception
of the crusade inaugurated by Tenskwatawa, the Shawano prophet, in
1805. (See plate +LXXXV+.)

[Illustration: PL. CXV

  THE GHOST DANCE—PRAYING]


                    PRESENT CONDITION OF THE DANCE

Among most of these tribes the movement is already extinct, having
died a natural death, excepting in the case of the Sioux. The Shoshoni
and some others lost faith in it after the failure of the first
predictions. The Sioux probably discontinued the dance before the final
surrender, as the battle of Wounded Knee and the subsequent events
convinced even the most fanatic believers that their expectations of
invulnerability and supernatural assistance were deceptive. The Paiute
were yet dancing a year ago, and as their dream has received no such
rude awakening as among the Sioux, they are probably still patiently
awaiting the great deliverance, in spite of repeated postponements,
although the frenzied earnestness of the early period has long ago
abated. The Kiowa, who discarded the doctrine on the adverse report of
Ä′piatañ, have recently taken up the dance again and are now dancing
as religiously as ever under the leadership of the old men, although
the progressive element in the tribe is strongly opposed to it. Among
the other tribes in Oklahoma—especially the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Caddo,
Wichita, Pawnee, and Oto—the Ghost dance has become a part of the
tribal life and is still performed at frequent intervals, although
the feverish expectation of a few years ago has now settled down into
something closely approaching the Christian hope of a reunion with
departed friends in a happier world at some time in the unknown future.

As for the great messiah himself, when last heard from Wovoka was on
exhibition as an attraction at the Midwinter fair in San Francisco. By
this time he has doubtless retired into his original obscurity.

                      PARALLELS IN OTHER SYSTEMS

  I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your
  daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your
  young men shall see visions.—_Joel._

  How is it then, brethren? When ye come together every one of you
  hath a doctrine, hath a revelation.—_I Corinthians._


                          THE BIBLICAL PERIOD

The remote in time or distance is always strange. The familiar present
is always natural and a matter of course. Beyond the narrow range of
our horizon imagination creates a new world, but as we advance in
any direction, or as we go back over forgotten paths, we find ever
a continuity and a succession. The human race is one in thought and
action. The systems of our highest modern civilizations have their
counterparts among all the nations, and their chain of parallels
stretches backward link by link until we find their origin and
interpretation in the customs and rites of our own barbarian ancestors,
or of our still existing aboriginal tribes. There is nothing new under
the sun.

The Indian messiah religion is the inspiration of a dream. Its ritual
is the dance, the ecstasy, and the trance. Its priests are hypnotics
and cataleptics. All these have formed a part of every great religious
development of which we have knowledge from the beginning of history.

In the ancestors of the Hebrews, as described in the Old Testament, we
have a pastoral people, living in tents, acquainted with metal working,
but without letters, agriculture, or permanent habitations. They had
reached about the plane of our own Navaho, but were below that of the
Pueblo. Their mythologic and religious system was closely parallel.
Their chiefs were priests who assumed to govern by inspiration from
God, communicated through frequent dreams and waking visions. Each of
the patriarchs is the familiar confidant of God and his angels, going
up to heaven in dreams and receiving direct instructions in waking
visits, and regulating his family and his tribe, and ordering their
religious ritual, in accord with these instructions. Jacob, alone in
the desert, sleeps and dreams, and sees a ladder reaching to heaven,
with angels going up and down upon it, and God himself, who tells him
of the future greatness of the Jewish nation. So Wovoka, asleep on
the mountain, goes up to the Indian heaven and is told by the Indian
god of the coming restoration of his race. Abraham is “tempted” by
God and commanded to sacrifice his son, and proceeds to carry out the
supernatural injunction. So Black Coyote dreams and is commanded to
sacrifice himself for the sake of his children.

[Illustration: PL. CXVI

  THE GHOST DANCE—INSPIRATION]

Coming down to a later period we find the Chaldean Job declaring
that God speaketh “in a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep
sleep falleth upon men; then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth
their instruction.” The whole of the prophecies are given as direct
communications from the other world, with the greatest particularity
of detail, as, for instance, in the beginning of the book of Ezekiel,
where he says that “it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the
fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the
captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened and I saw
visions of God.”

In the New Testament, representing the results of six centuries of
development beyond the time of the prophets and in intimate contact
with more advanced civilizations, we still have the dream as the
controlling influence in religion. In the very beginning of the new
dispensation we are told that, while Joseph slept, the angel of the
Lord appeared to him in a dream, and as a result “Joseph being raised
from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him.” The most
important events in the history of the infant redeemer are regulated,
not in accordance with the ordinary manner of probabilities, but by
dreams.

The four gospels are full of inspirational dreams and trances, such as
the vision of Cornelius, and that of Peter, when he went up alone upon
the housetop to pray and “fell into a trance and saw heaven opened,”
and again when “a vision appeared to Paul in the night,” of a man
who begged him to come over into Macedonia, so that “immediately we
endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had
called us.” In another place Paul—the same Paul who had that wonderful
vision on the road to Damascus—declares that he knew a man who was
caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words. In Paul we have
the typical religious evangel, a young enthusiast, a man of sensibility
and refinement above his fellows, so carried away by devotion to his
ideal that he attaches himself to the most uncompromising sect among
his own people, and when it seems to be assailed by an alien force, not
content simply to hold his own belief, he seeks and obtains official
authority to root out the heresy. As he goes on this errand, “breathing
out threatenings and slaughter,” the mental strain overcomes him.
He falls down in the road, hears voices, and sees a strange light.
His companions raise him up and lead him by the hand into the city,
where for several days he remains sightless without food or drink.
From this time he is a changed man. Without any previous knowledge or
investigation of the new faith he believes himself called by heaven to
embrace it, and the same irrepressible enthusiasm which had made him
its bitterest persecutor leads him now to defend it against all the
world and even to cross the sea into a far country in obedience to a
dream to spread the doctrine. In many respects he reminds us forcibly
of such later evangelists as Fox and Wesley.

The cloudy indistinctness which Wovoka and his followers ascribe to
the Father as he appears to them in their trance visions has numerous
parallels in both Testaments. At Sinai the Lord declares to Moses, “I
come unto thee in a thick cloud,” and thereafter whenever Moses went
up the mountain or entered into the tabernacle to receive revelations
“the Lord descended upon it in a cloudy pillar.” Job also tells us that
“thick clouds are a covering to him,” and Isaiah says that he “rideth
upon a swift cloud,” which reminds us of the Ghost song of the Arapaho
representing the Indian redeemer as coming upon the whirlwind. Moses
goes up into a mountain to receive inspiration like Wovoka of the
Paiute and Bi′äñk̔i of the Kiowa. As Wovoka claims to bring rain or
snow at will, so Elijah declares that “there shall not be dew nor rain
these years, but according to my word,” while of the Jewish Messiah
himself his wondering disciples say that even the winds and the sea
obey him.

Fasting and solitary contemplation in lonely places were as powerful
auxiliaries to the trance condition in Bible days as now among the
tribes of the plains. When Daniel had his great vision by the river
Hiddekel, he tells us that he had been mourning for three full weeks,
during which time he “ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor
wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all.” When the vision
comes, all the strength and breath leave his body and he falls down,
and “then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the
ground.” Six hundred years later, Christ is “led by the spirit into
the wilderness, being forty days tempted by the devil, and in those
days he did eat nothing.” Another instance occurs at his baptism, when,
as he was coming out of the water, he saw the heavens opened and the
spirit like a dove, and heard a voice, and immediately was driven by
the spirit into the wilderness. In the transfiguration on the mountain,
when “his face did shine as the sun,” and in the agony of Gethsemane,
with its mental anguish and bloody sweat, we see the same phenomena
that appear in the lives of religious enthusiasts from Mohammed and
Joan of Arc down to George Fox and the prophets of the Ghost dance.

Dancing, which forms so important a part of primitive rituals, had a
place among the forms of the ancient Hebrew and of their neighbors,
although there are but few direct references to it in the Bible. The
best example occurs in the account of the transfer of the ark to Zion,
where there were processions and sacrifices, and King David himself
“danced before the Lord with all his might.”


                             MOHAMMEDANISM

Six hundred years after the birth of Christianity another great
religion, which numbers its adherents by the hundred million, had
its origin in the same region and among a kindred Semitic race. Its
prophet and high priest was the cataleptic Mohammed, who was born
about the year 570 and died in 642. In infancy and all through life
he was afflicted with epileptic attacks and fainting fits, during
which he would lose all appearance of life without always losing
inner consciousness. It was while in this condition that he received
the visions and revelations on which he built his religious system.
Frequently at such times it was necessary to wrap him up to preserve
life in his body, and at other times he was restored by being
drenched with cold water. At one time for a period of two years he was
in such a mental condition—subject to hallucinations—that he doubted
his own sanity, believing himself to be possessed by evil spirits, and
contemplated suicide. “It is disputed whether Mohammed was epileptic,
cataleptic, hysteric, or what not. Sprenger seems to think that the
answer to this medical question is the key to the whole problem of
Islam.” (“_Mohammedanism_,” in _Encyclopedia Britannica_.) To how many
other systems might such an answer be the key?

[Illustration: PL. CXVII

  THE GHOST DANCE—RIGID]

We are told that ordinarily his body had but little natural warmth, but
that whenever the angel appeared to him, as the Mohammedan biographers
express it, the perspiration burst out on his forehead, his eyes became
red, he trembled violently, and would bellow like a young camel—all the
accompaniments of the most violent epileptic fit. Usually the fit ended
in a swoon. There is no question that he was sincere in his claim of
divine inspiration. His last hours were serene and peaceful, and there
is no evidence of the slightest misgiving on his part as to the reality
of his mission as a prophet sent from God. Some of his inspiration came
in dreams, and he was accustomed to say that a prophet’s dream is a
revelation. At times the revelation came to him without any painful or
strange accompaniment.

The fit during which he received the revelation of his religious
mission is thus described, as it came to him after a long period of
despondency and mental hallucinations: “In this morbid state of feeling
he is said to have heard a voice, and on raising his head, beheld
Gabriel, who assured him he was the prophet of God. Frightened, he
returned home, and called for covering. He had a fit, and they poured
cold water on him, and when he came to himself he heard these words:
‘Oh, thou covered one, arise, and preach, and magnify thy Lord;’ and
henceforth, we are told, he received revelations without intermission.
Before this supposed revelation he had been medically treated on
account of the evil eye, and when the Koran first descended to him he
fell into fainting fits, when, after violent shudderings, his eyes
closed, and his mouth foamed.” (_Gardner, Faiths of the World._)

Solitude also had much to do with his visions, as a great part of his
early life was spent in the lonely occupation of a shepherd among
the Arabian mountains. Like other prophets he asserted that the
various angels had offered him control over the stars, the sun, the
mountains, and the sea. Further, it is claimed most positively by all
his followers that his great ascent into the seven heavens was made
bodily and in full wakefulness, and not merely in spirit while asleep,
and this assertion they supported by “the declarations of God and his
prophet, the imâms of the truth, the verses of the Koran, and thousands
of traditions,” as earnestly as religious enthusiasts the world over
have ever backed up the impossible.

The kinship of the late Semitic idea to the old is well exemplified in
Mohammed’s account of this vision, in which he is conducted to Mount
Sinai, where he is directed to alight and pray, because there God
had spoken to Moses, after which he is conducted to Bethlehem, where
again he is directed to alight and pray, because there Jesus was born,
after which again he is brought into the presence of Abraham, Moses,
Enoch, John the Baptist, and Jesus, by all of whom he was hailed as a
worthy brother and prophet. The direct descent becomes plainer still
when we learn how Mohammed, on his return from talking with God in the
seventh heaven, again meets Moses, who persuades him that the religious
exercises prescribed by God for the faithful are too onerous, and goes
back with him to plead with the Lord for a reduction of the daily
prayers from fifty to five as Abraham pleaded for Sodom.

The spirit world of our Indians is a place where death and old age are
unknown, and where every one is happy in the simple happiness which
he knew on earth—hunting, feasting, and playing the old-time games
with former friends, but without war, for there all is peace. The
ideal happiness is material, perhaps, but it is such happiness as the
world might long for, with nothing in it gross or beyond reasonable
probability. The Semitic ideal, from which our own is derived, is very
different. We get one conception, in the book of Revelation and the
limits of space, whose business is every morning to praise the Lord
and set all the cocks on earth to crowing after him. There is an angel
who bathes daily in a river, after which he flaps his wings, and from
every drop that falls from them there is created an angel with 20,000
faces and 40,000 tongues, each of which speaks a distinct language,
unintelligible to the rest. But the masterpiece is the tree _tooba_,
whose fruit is the food of the inhabitants of paradise. Every branch
produces a hundred thousand different-colored fruits, while from its
roots run rivers of water, milk, wine, and honey. As if this were not
enough, the tree produces also ready-made clothing. “On the tree were
baskets filled with garments of the brocade and satin of paradise.
A million of baskets are allotted to each believer, each basket
containing a hundred thousand garments, all of different class and
fashion”—and so on ad nauseam. (_Merrick’s Mohammed._) When we reflect
that this is accepted by more than 150,000,000 civilized Orientals,
from whom we have derived much of our own culture, we may, perhaps, be
more tolerantly disposed toward the American Indian belief.


                              JOAN OF ARC

The most remarkable, the most heroic and pathetic instance of religious
hallucination in Europe is that of Joan of Arc, known as the Maid of
Orleans, born in 1412 and burned at the stake in 1431, and recently
beatified as the patron saint of France. Naturally of a contemplative
disposition, she was accustomed from earliest childhood to long fasts
and solitary communings, in which she brooded over the miserable
condition of her country, then overrun by English armies. When 13 years
of age, she had a vision in which a voice spoke to her from out of a
great light, telling her that God had chosen her to restore France.
She immediately fell on her knees and made a vow of virginity and
entire devotion to the cause, and from that day to the time of her
cruel death she believed herself inspired and guided by supernatural
voices to lead her countrymen against the invader. A simple peasant
girl, she sought out the royal court and boldly announced to the king
her divine mission. Her manner made such an impression that she was
assigned a command, and putting on a soldier’s dress and carrying a
sword which she claimed had come to her through miraculous means, she
led the armies of France, performing superhuman feats of courage and
endurance and winning victory after victory for three years until she
was finally captured. After a long and harassing mockery of a trial, in
which the whole machinery of the law and the church was brought into
action for the destruction of one poor girl barely 19 years of age, she
was finally condemned and burned at Rouen, ostensibly as a witch and a
heretic, but really as the most dangerous enemy of English tyranny in
France.

  THE GHOST DANCE—UNCONSCIOUS]

She was forever hearing these spirit voices, which she called “her
voices” or “her counsel.” They spoke to her with articulate words
in the ripple of the village fountain, in the vesper bells, in the
rustling of the leaves, and in the sighing of the wind. Sometimes it
was the warlike archangel Michael, but oftener it was the gentle Saint
Katherine, who appeared to her as a beautiful woman wearing a crown.
Her visions must be ascribed to the effect of the troubled times in
which she lived, acting on an enthusiastic, unquestioning religious
temperament. She is described as physically robust and intellectually
keen, aside from her hallucination, as was proven in her trial, and
there is no evidence that she was subject to epilepsy or other abnormal
conditions such as belonged to Mohammed and most others of the same
class. Her long and frequent fasts unquestionably aided the result. She
claimed no supernatural powers outside of her peculiar mission, and in
every public undertaking relied entirely on the guidance of her voices.

Toward the end these voices were accompanied by other hallucinations,
together with presentiments of her coming death. On one occasion, while
assaulting a garrison, her men fled, leaving her standing on the moat
with only four or five soldiers. Seeing her danger, a French officer
galloped up to rescue her and impatiently asked her why she stood
there alone. Lifting her helmet from her face she looked at him with
astonishment and replied that she was not alone—that she had 50,000 men
with her—and then, despite his entreaties, she turned to her phantom
army and shouted out her commands to bring logs to bridge the moat. It
was in April, while standing alone on the ramparts of Mélun, that the
voices first told her that she would be taken before midsummer. From
that time the warning was constantly repeated, and although she told
no one and still exposed herself fearlessly, she no longer assumed the
responsibility of command. Two months later she was in the hands of her
enemies.

Throughout the trial every effort was made by her enemies to shake her
statement as to the voices, or, failing in that, to prove them from
the devil, but to the last she steadfastly maintained that the voices
were with her and came from heaven. According to her own statement
these voices were three—one remained always with her, another visited
her at short intervals, while both deliberated with the third. On one
occasion, when hard pressed by her enemies, she answered solemnly, “I
believe firmly, as firmly as I believe the Christian faith and that God
has redeemed us from the pains of hell, that the voice comes from God
and by his command.” And again she asserted, “I have seen Saint Michael
and the two saints so well that I know they are saints of paradise. I
have seen them with my bodily eyes, and I believe they are saints as
firmly as I believe that God exists.”

When questioned as to her original inspiration, she stated that the
voice had first come to her when she was about 13 years of age. “The
first time I heard it I was very much afraid. It was in my father’s
garden at noon in the summer. I had fasted the day before. The voice
came from the right hand by the church, and there was a great light
with it. When I came into France, I heard it frequently. I believe it
was sent me from God. After I heard it three times, I knew it was the
voice of an angel. I understand perfectly what it says. It bade me be
good and go to church often, and it told me I must go into France. Two
or three times a week it said I must go into France, until I could
no longer rest where I was. It told me I should raise the siege of
Orleans, and that Robert de Baudricourt would give me people to conduct
me. Twice he repulsed me, but the third time he received me and sped me
on my way.”

The examiners were very curious to know by what sign she had recognized
the king when she had first seen him in the midst of his courtiers.
To this question she said she must first consult with Saint Katherine
before replying, and afterward continued: “The sign was a crown. The
first time I saw the king he had the sign, and it signified that he
should hold the kingdom of France. I neither touched it nor kissed it.
The angel came by the command of God and entered by the door of the
room. I came with the angel up the steps to the king’s room and the
angel came before the king and bowed and inclined himself before the
king, and said: ‘My lord, here is your sign; take it.’ He departed by
the way he had come. There were a number of other angels with him, and
Saint Katherine and Saint Margaret. In the little chapel he left me. I
was neither glad nor afraid, but I was very sorrowful, and I wish he
had taken away my soul with him.”

  THE CROW DANCE]

To another question she replied emphatically: “If I were at judgment,
if I saw the fire kindled and the fagots ablaze and the executioner
ready to stir the fire, and if I were in the fire, I would say no more,
and to the death I would maintain what I have said in the trial.”

The end came at last in the market place of Rouen, when this young
girl, whose name for years had been a terror to the whole English army,
was dragged in her white shroud and bound to the stake, and saw the
wood heaped up around her and the cruel fire lighted under her feet.
“Brother Martin, standing almost in the draft of the flames, heard
her sob with a last sublime effort of faith, bearing her witness to
God whom she trusted: ‘My voices have not deceived me!’ And then came
death.” (_Parr, Jeanne d’Arc._)


                          DANCE OF SAINT JOHN

In 1374 an epidemic of maniacal religious dancing broke out on the
lower Rhine and spread rapidly over Germany, the Netherlands, and
into France. The victims of the mania claimed to dance in honor of
Saint John. Men and women went about dancing hand in hand, in pairs,
or in a circle, on the streets, in the churches, at their homes, or
wherever they might be, hour after hour without rest until they fell
into convulsions. While dancing they sang doggerel verses in honor
of Saint John and uttered unintelligible cries. Of course they saw
visions. At last whole companies of these crazy fanatics, men, women,
and children, went dancing through the country, along the public roads,
and into the cities, until the clergy felt compelled to interfere, and
cured the dancers by exorcising the evil spirits that moved them. In
the fifteenth century the epidemic broke out again. The dancers were
now formed into divisions by the clergy and sent to the church of Saint
Vitus at Rotestein, where prayers were said for them, and they were led
in procession around the altar and dismissed cured. Hence the name of
Saint Vitus’ dance given to one variety of abnormal muscular tremor.
(_Schaff, Religious Encyclopedia._)


                            THE FLAGELLANTS

About the same time another strange religious extravagance spread over
western Europe. Under the name of Flagellants, thousands of enthusiasts
banded together with crosses, banners, hymns, and all the paraphernalia
of religion, and went about in procession, publicly scourging one
another as an atonement for their sins and the sins of mankind in
general. They received their first impetus from the preaching of Saint
Anthony of Padua in the thirteenth century. About the year 1260 the
movement broke out nearly simultaneously in Italy, France, Germany,
Austria, and Poland, and afterward spread into Denmark and England. It
was at its height in the fourteenth century. In Germany in 1261 the
devotees, preceded by banner and crosses, marched with faces veiled
and bodies bared above the waist, and scourged themselves twice a day
for thirty-three successive days in memory of the thirty-three years
of Christ’s life. The strokes of the whip were timed to the music of
hymns. Men and women together took part in the scourging. The mania
finally wore itself out, but reappeared in 1349 with more systematic
organization. According to Schaff, “When they came to towns, the bands
marched in regular military order and singing hymns. At the time of
flagellation they selected a square or churchyard or field. Taking off
their shoes and stockings and forming a circle, they girded themselves
with aprons and laid down flat on the ground.... The leader then
stepped over each one, touched them with the whip, and bade them rise.
As each was touched they followed after the leader and imitated him.
Once all on their feet the flagellation began. The brethren went two
by two around the whole circle, striking their backs till the blood
trickled down from the wounds. The whip consisted of three thongs, each
with four iron teeth. During the flagellation a hymn was sung. After
all had gone around the circle the whole body again fell on the ground,
beating upon their breasts. On arising they flagellated themselves
a second time. While the brethren were putting on their clothes a
collection was taken up among the audience. The scene was concluded
by the reading of a letter from Christ, which an angel had brought
to earth and which commended the pilgrimages of the Flagellants. The
fraternities never tarried longer than a single day in a town. They
gained great popularity, and it was considered an honor to entertain
them.” (_Schaff, Religious Encyclopedia._) The society still exists
among the Latin races, although under the ban of the church. As late
as 1820 a procession of Flagellants passed through the streets of
Lisbon. Under the name of Penitentes they have several organizations
in the Mexican towns of our southwest, where they periodically appear
in processions, inflicting horrible self-torture on themselves, even
to the extent of binding one of their number upon a cross, which is
then set up in the ground, while the blood streams down the body of
the victim from the wounds made by a crown of cactus thorns and from
innumerable gashes caused by the thorny whips. Such things among people
called civilized enables us to understand the feeling which leads the
Indian to offer himself a willing sacrifice in the sun dance and other
propitiatory rites.


               RANTERS, QUAKERS, AND FIFTH-MONARCHY MEN

The middle of the seventeenth century was a time of great religious and
political upheaval in England. Hatreds were intense and persecutions
cruel and bitter, until men’s minds gave way under the strain. “The
air was thick with reports of prophecies and miracles, and there were
men of all parties who lived on the border land between sanity and
insanity.” This was due chiefly to the long-continued mental tension
which bore on the whole population during this troublous period, and
in particular cases to wholesale confiscations, by which families
were ruined, and to confinement in wretched prisons, suffering from
insufficient food and brutal treatment. Individuals even in the
established church began to assert supernatural power, while numerous
new sects sprang up, with prophecy, miracle working, hypnotism, and
convulsive ecstasy as parts of their doctrine or ritual. Chief among
these were the Ranters, the Quakers, and the Fifth-Monarchy Men. The
first and last have disappeared with the conditions which produced
them; but the Quakers, being based on a principle, have outlasted
persecution, and, discarding the extravagances which belonged to the
early period, are now on a permanent foundation under the name of the
“Society of Friends.” One of the Ranter prophets, in 1650, claimed to
be the reincarnation of Melchizedek, and even declared his divinity. He
asserted that certain persons then living were Cain, Judas, Jeremiah,
etc., whom, he had raised from the dead, and the strangest part of
it was that the persons concerned stoutly affirmed the truth of his
assertion. Others of them claimed to work miracles and to produce
lights and apparitions in the dark. In Barclay’s opinion all the
evidence “supports the view that these persons were mad, and had a
singular power of producing a kind of sympathetic madness or temporary
aberration of intellect in others.”

We are better acquainted with the Quakers (Friends), although it is
not generally known that they were originally addicted to similar
practices. Such, however, is the fact, as is shown by the name itself.
Their founder, George Fox, claimed and believed that he had the gift
of prophecy and clairvoyance, and of healing by a mere word, and his
biographer, Janney, of the same denomination, apparently sees no reason
to doubt that such was the case. As might have been expected, he was
also a believer in dreams.

We are told that on one occasion, on coming into the town of Lichfield,
“a very remarkable exercise attended his mind, and going through
the streets without his shoes he cried, ‘Woe to the bloody city of
Lichfield.’ His feelings were deeply affected, for there seemed to
be a channel of blood running down the streets, and the market place
appeared like a pool of blood.” On inquiry he learned that a large
number of Christians had been put to death there during the reign
of the Emperor Diocletian thirteen centuries before. “He therefore
attributed the exercise which came upon him to the sense that was given
him of the blood of the martyrs.”

We are also told that he “received an evidence” of the great fire of
London in 1666, before the event, and Janney narrates at length a
“still more remarkable vision” of the same fire by another Friend,
“whose prophecy is well attested.” According to the account, this man
rode into the city, as though having come in haste, and went up and
down the streets for two days, prophesying that the city would be
destroyed by fire. To others of his own denomination he declared that
he had had a vision of the event some time before, but had delayed to
declare it as commanded, until he felt the fire in his own bosom. When
the fire did occur as he had predicted, he stood before the flames with
arms outstretched, as if to stay their advance, until forcibly brought
away by his friends.

In mental and physical temperament Fox seems to have closely resembled
Mohammed and the Indian prophets of the Ghost dance. We are told that
he had much mental suffering and was often under great temptation. “He
fasted much, and walked abroad in solitary places. Taking his Bible,
he sat in hollow trees or secluded spots, and often at night he walked
alone in silent meditation.” At one time “he fell into such a condition
that he looked like a corpse, and many who came to see him supposed him
to be really dead. In this trance he continued fourteen days, after
which his sorrow began to abate, and with brokenness of heart and tears
of joy he acknowledged the infinite love of God.” (_Janney, George
Fox._)

The sect obtained the name of Quakers from the violent tremblings which
overcame the worshipers in the early days, and which they regarded
as manifestations of divine power on them. So violent were these
convulsions that, as their own historian tells us, on one occasion the
house itself seemed to be shaken. According to another authority, men
and women sometimes fell down and lay upon the ground struggling as if
for life. Their ministers, however, seem not to have encouraged such
exhibitions, but strove to relieve the fit by putting the patient to
bed and administering soothing medicines. (_“Quakers,” Encyclopedia
Britannica._)

The Fifth-Monarchy Men were a small band of religionists who arose
about the same time, proclaiming that the “Fifth Monarchy” prophesied
by Daniel was at hand, when Christ would come down from heaven and
reign visibly upon earth for a thousand years. In 1657 they formed
a plot to kill Cromwell, and in 1661 they broke out in insurrection
at night, parading the streets with a banner on which was depicted a
lion, proclaiming that Christ had come and declaring that they were
invulnerable and invincible, as “King Jesus” was their invisible
leader. Troops were called out against them, but the Fifth-Monarchy
Men, expecting supernatural assistance, refused to submit, and fought
until they were nearly all shot down. The leaders were afterward
tried and executed. (_Janney’s George Fox_ and _Schaff’s Religious
Encyclopedia_.)


                            FRENCH PROPHETS

Forty years later, about the end of the seventeenth century, another
sect of convulsionists, being driven out of France, “found an asylum in
Protestant countries [and] carried with them the disease, both of mind
and body, which their long sufferings had produced.” They spread into
Germany and Holland, and in 1706 reached England, where they became
known as “French prophets.” Their meetings were characterized by such
extravagance of convulsion and trance performance that they became
the wonder of the ignorant and the scandal of the more intelligent
classes, notwithstanding which the infection spread far and wide.
We are told that they “were wrought upon in a very extraordinary
manner, not only in their minds, but also in their physical systems.
They had visions and trances and were subject to violent agitations
of body. Men and women, and even little children, were so exercised
that spectators were struck with great wonder and astonishment. Their
powerful admonitions and prophetic warnings were heard and received
with reverence and awe.”

At one time Charles Wesley had occasion to stop for the night with a
gentleman who belonged to the sect. Wesley was unaware of the fact
until, as they were about to go to bed, his new friend suddenly fell
into a violent fit and began to gobble like a turkey. Wesley was
frightened and began exorcising him, so that he soon recovered from the
fit, when they went to bed, although the evangelist confesses that he
himself did not sleep very soundly with Satan so near him.

Some time afterward Wesley with several companions visited a prophetess
of the sect, as he says, to try whether the spirits came from God.
She was a young woman of agreeable speech and manner. “Presently she
leaned back in her chair and had strong workings in her breast and
uttered deep sighs. Her head and her hands and by turns every part of
her body were affected with convulsive motions. This continued about
ten minutes. Then she began to speak with a clear, strong voice, but so
interrupted with the workings, sighings, and contortions of her body
that she seldom brought forth half a sentence together. What she said
was chiefly in spiritual words, and all as in the person of God, as if
it were the language of immediate inspiration.” (_Southey’s Wesley_,
_I_, and _Evans’ Shakers_.)


                                JUMPERS

About 1740 a similar extravagant sect, known as the Jumpers, arose in
Wales. According to the description given by Wesley, their exercises
were a very exact parallel of the Ghost dance. “After the preaching
was over anyone who pleased gave out a verse of a hymn, and this
they sung over and over again, with all their might and main, thirty
or forty times, till some of them worked themselves into a sort of
drunkenness or madness; they were then violently agitated, and leaped
up and down in all manner of postures frequently for hours together.” A
contemporary writer states that he had seen perhaps ten thousand at a
single meeting of the Jumpers shouting out in the midst of the sermon
and ready to leap for joy. (_Southey’s Wesley_, _II_.)


                              METHODISTS

About the same time the Methodists originated in England under Wesley
and Whitefield, and their assemblies were characterized by all the
hysteric and convulsive extravagance which they brought with them to
this country, and which is not even yet extinct in the south. The
most remarkable of these exhibitions took place under the preaching of
Wesley, following him, as we are told, wherever he went. Whitefield,
although more forcible and sensational in his preaching, did not at
first produce the same effect on his hearers, and considered such
manifestations as but doubtful signs of the presence of the Lord and
by no means to be encouraged. On preaching, however, to a congregation
in which Wesley had already produced such convulsions, and where,
consequently, there was a predisposition in this direction, several
persons were thus seized and sank down upon the floor, and we are told
by the biographer “this was a great triumph to Wesley.”

Wesley himself describes several instances. At one time, he states,
a physician suspecting fraud attended a meeting during which a woman
was thrown into a fit, crying aloud and weeping violently, until great
drops of sweat ran down her face and her whole body shook. The doctor
stood close by, noting every symptom, and not knowing what to think,
being convinced that it was not fraud or any natural disorder. “But
when both her soul and body were healed in a moment he acknowledged
the finger of God.” On another occasion, Wesley tells us, “While I
was earnestly inviting all men to enter into the Holiest by this new
and living way, many of those that heard began to call upon God with
strong cries and tears. Some sank down, and there remained no strength
in them. Others exceedingly trembled and quaked. Some were torn with a
kind of convulsive motion in every part of their bodies, and that so
violently that often four or five persons could not hold one of them.
I have seen many hysterical and epileptic fits, but none of them were
like these in many respects. I immediately prayed that God would not
suffer those who were weak to be offended; but one woman was greatly,
being sure that they might help it if they would, no one should
persuade her to the contrary; and she was got three or four yards, when
she also dropped down in as violent an agony as the rest.”

At another time, “while he was speaking one of his hearers dropped
down, and in the course of half an hour seven others, in violent
agonies. The pains as of hell, he says, came about them; but
notwithstanding his own reasoning neither he nor his auditors called
in question the divine origin of these emotions, and they went away
rejoicing and praising God.... Sometimes he scarcely began to speak
before some of his believers, overwrought with expectation, fell into
the crisis, for so it may be called in this case, as properly as in
animal magnetism. Sometimes his voice could scarcely be heard amid the
groans and cries of these suffering and raving enthusiasts. It was
not long before men, women, and children began to act the demoniac as
well as the convert. Wesley had seen many hysterical fits and many
fits of epilepsy, but none that were like these, and he confirmed the
patients in their belief that they were torn of Satan. One or two
indeed perplexed him a little, for they were tormented in such an
unaccountable manner that they seemed to be lunatic, he says, as well
as sore vexed. But suspicions of this kind made little impression
upon his intoxicated understanding; the fanaticism which he had
excited in others was now reacting upon himself. How should it have
been otherwise? A Quaker, who was present at one meeting and inveighed
against what he called the dissimulation of these creatures, caught
the contagious emotion himself, and even while he was biting his lips
and knitting his brows, dropped down as if he had been struck by
lightning.” (_Southey’s Wesley._)


                                SHAKERS

About the year 1750 there originated in England another peculiar body
of sectarians calling themselves the “United Society of Believers in
Christ’s Second Appearing,” but commonly known, for obvious reasons,
as Shakers. Their chief prophetess and founder was “Mother” Ann Lee,
whom they claim as the actual reincarnation of Christ. They claim also
the inspiration of prophecy, the gift of healing, and sometimes even
the gift of tongues, and believe in the reality of constant intercourse
with the spirit world through visions. In consequence of persecution
in England, on account of their public dancing, shouting, and shaking,
they removed to this country about 1780 and settled at New Lebanon, New
York, where the society still keeps up its organization.

The best idea of the Shakers is given in a small volume by Evans,
who was himself a member of the sect. Speaking of the convulsive
manifestations among them, he says: “Sometimes, after sitting awhile
in silent meditation, they were seized with a mighty trembling, under
which they would often express the indignation of God against all sin.
At other times they were exercised with singing, shouting, and leaping
for joy at the near prospect of salvation. They were often exercised
with great agitation of body and limbs, shaking, running, and walking
the floor, with a variety of other operations and signs, swiftly
passing and repassing each other like clouds agitated with a mighty
wind. These exercises, so strange in the eyes of the beholders, brought
upon them the appellation of Shakers, which has been their most common
name of distinction ever since.” With regard to their dancing, he says:
“It is pretty generally known that the Shakers serve God by singing
and dancing; but why they practice this mode of worship is not so
generally understood.... When sin is fully removed, by confessing and
forsaking it, the cause of heaviness, gloom, and sorrow is gone, and
joy and rejoicing, and thanksgiving and praise are then the spontaneous
effects of a true spirit of devotion. And whatever manner the spirit
may dictate, or whatever the form into which the spirit may lead, it
is acceptable to Him from whom the spirit proceeds.” On one particular
occasion, “previous to our coming we called a meeting and there was
[sic] so many gifts (such as prophecies, revelations, visions, and
dreams) in confirmation of a former revelation for us to come that
some could hardly wait for others to tell their gifts. We had a joyful
meeting and danced till morning.”

Of Ann Lee, their founder, he asserts that she saw Jesus Christ in open
vision and received direct revelations from this source. On a certain
occasion she herself declared to her followers: “The room over your
head is full of angels of God. I see them, and you could see them if
you were redeemed. I look in at the windows of heaven and see what
there is in the invisible world. I see the angels of God, and hear them
sing. I see the glories of God. I see Ezekiel Goodrich flying from one
heaven to another!” And, turning to the company present, she said, “Go
in and join his resurrection.” She then began to sing, and they praised
the Lord in the dance. On another occasion she said: “The apostles, in
their day, saw as through a glass darkly, but we see face to face, and
see things as they are, and converse with spirits and see their states.
The gospel is preached to souls who have left the body. I see thousands
of the dead rising and coming to judgment, now at this present time.”
At another time she declared that she had seen a certain young woman in
the spirit world, “praising God in the dance;” and of a man deceased,
“He has appeared to me again, and has arisen from the dead and come
into the first heaven and is traveling on to the second and third
heaven.”

Their dance is performed regularly at their religious gatherings at the
New Lebanon settlement. The two sexes are arranged in ranks opposite
and facing each other, in which position they listen to a sermon by
one of the elders, after which a hymn is sung. They then form a circle
around a party of singers, to whose singing they keep time in the
dance. At times the excitement and fervor of spirit become intense,
and their bodily evolutions as rapid as those of the dervishes,
although still preserving the order of the dance. (_Evans’ Shakers_ and
encyclopedia articles on _Shakers_.)


                           KENTUCKY REVIVAL

About the year 1800 an epidemic of religious frenzy, known as the
Kentucky Revival, broke out in Kentucky and Tennessee, chiefly among
the Methodists and Baptists, with accompaniments that far surpassed the
wildest excesses of the Ghost dance. Fanatic preachers taught their
deluded followers that the spiritual advent of the kingdom was near at
hand, when Christ would reign on earth and there would be an end of
all sin. The date generally fixed for the consummation was the summer
of 1805, and the excitement continued and grew in violence for several
years until the time came and passed without extraordinary event,
when the frenzy gradually subsided, leaving the ignorant believers
in a state of utter collapse. The performances at the meetings of
these enthusiasts were of the most exaggerated camp-meeting order,
such as may still be witnessed in many parts of the south, especially
among the colored people. Evans, the Shaker historian, who is strong
in the gift of faith, tells us that “the subjects of this work were
greatly exercised in dreams, visions, revelations, and the spirit of
prophecy. In these gifts of the spirit they saw and testified that the
great day of God was at hand, that Christ was about to set up his
kingdom on earth, and that this very work would terminate in the full
manifestation of the latter day of glory.”

From another authority, endowed perhaps with less of fervor but with
more of common sense, we get a description of these “exercises” which
has a familiar ring that seems to bring it very near home. “The
people remained on the ground day and night, listening to the most
exciting sermons, and engaging in a mode of worship which consisted in
alternate crying, laughing, singing, and shouting, accompanied with
gesticulations of a most extraordinary character. Often there would
be an unusual outcry; some bursting forth into loud ejaculations of
thanksgiving; others exhorting their careless friends to ‘turn to
the Lord;’ some struck with terror, and hastening to escape; others
trembling, weeping, and swooning away, till every appearance of life
was gone, and the extremities of the body assumed the coldness of a
corpse. At one meeting not less than a thousand persons fell to the
ground, apparently without sense or motion. It was common to see them
shed tears plentifully about an hour before they fell. They were then
seized with a general tremor, and sometimes they uttered one or two
piercing shrieks in the moment of falling. This latter phenomenon was
common to both sexes, to all ages, and to all sorts of characters.”
(_Caswall, The Prophet of the Nineteenth Century_, quoted by _Remy_.)

After a time these crazy performances in the sacred name of religion
became so much a matter of course that they were regularly classified
in categories as the rolls, the jerks, the barks, etc. “The rolling
exercise was affected by doubling themselves up, then rolling from one
side to the other like a hoop, or in extending the body horizontally
and rolling over and over in the filth like so many swine. The jerk
consisted in violent spasms and twistings of every part of the body.
Sometimes the head was twisted round so that the head was turned
to the back, and the countenance so much distorted that not one of
its features was to be recognized. When attacked by the jerks, they
sometimes hopped like frogs, and the face and limbs underwent the most
hideous contortions. The bark consisted in throwing themselves on all
fours, growling, showing their teeth, and barking like dogs. Sometimes
a number of people crouching down in front of the minister continued
to bark as long as he preached. These last were supposed to be more
especially endowed with the gifts of prophecy, dreams, rhapsodies, and
visions of angels.” (_Remy, Journey to Great Salt Lake City, I._)

Twenty years later the jerking epidemic again broke out in Tennessee,
and is described in a letter by the famous visionary and revivalist,
Lorenzo Dow, who was then preaching in the same region. His description
agrees with that given the author by old men who lived at this time
in eastern Tennessee. We quote from Dow’s letter: “There commenced a
trembling among the wicked. One and a second fell from their seats. I
think for eleven hours there was no cessation of the loud cries. Of
the people, some who were standing and sitting fell like men shot on
the field of battle, and I felt it like a tremor to run through my
soul and veins so that it took away my limb power, so that I fell to
the floor, and by faith saw a greater blessing than I had hitherto
experienced.” At another place he says: “After taking a cup of tea, I
began to speak to a vast audience, and I observed about thirty to have
the jerks, though they strove to keep as still as they could. These
emotions were involuntary and irresistible, as any unprejudiced mind
might see.” At Marysville “many appeared to feel the word, but about
fifty felt the jerks. On Sunday, at Knoxville, the governor being
present, about one hundred and fifty had the jerking exercise, among
them a circuit preacher, Johnson, who had opposed them a little while
before. Camp meeting commenced at Liberty. Here I saw the jerks, and
some danced. The people are taken with jerking irresistibly, and if
they strive to resist it it worries them more than hard work. Their
eyes, when dancing, seem to be fixed upward as if upon an invisible
object, and they are lost to all below. I passed by a meeting house
where I observed the undergrowth had been cut down for a camp meeting,
and from fifty to a hundred saplings left breast high, which appeared
to me so slovenish that I could not but ask my guide the cause, who
observed they were topped so high and left for the people to jerk
by. This so excited my attention that I went over the ground to view
it, and found where the people had laid hold of them and jerked so
powerfully that they kicked up the earth as a horse stamping flies.
Persecutors are more subject to the jerks than others, and they have
cursed and swore and damned it while jerking.” Then he says: “I have
seen Presbyterians, Methodists, Quakers, Baptists, Church of England,
and Independents exercised with the jerks—gentlemen and ladies, black
and white, rich and poor—without exception. Those naturalists who wish
to get it to philosophize upon it and the most godly are excepted from
the jerks. The wicked are more afraid of it than of the smallpox or
yellow fever.”

It is worthy of note that, according to his account, investigators who
wished to study the phenomenon were unable to come under the influence,
even though they so desired.


                              ADVENTISTS

About 1831 William Miller, a licensed minister, began to preach the
advent of Christ and the destruction of the world, fixing the date
for the year 1843. Like most others of his kind who have achieved
notoriety, he based his prediction on the prophecies of the Bible,
which he figured out with mathematical exactness. He began preaching
in New York and New England, but afterward traveled southward,
delivering, it is said, over three thousand lectures in support of his
theory. His predictions led to the formation of a new sect commonly
known as Adventists, who are said at one time to have numbered over
fifty thousand. Carried away by blind enthusiasm they made their
preparations for the end of all things, which they confidently expected
in the summer of 1843. As the time drew near the believers made all
preparations for their final departure from the world, many of them
selling their property, and arraying themselves in white “ascension
robes,” which were actually put on sale by the storekeepers for the
occasion. But the day and the year went by without the fulfillment
of the prophecy. Miller claimed to have discovered an error in his
calculations and fixed one or two other dates later on, but as these
also proved false, his followers lost faith and the delusion died out.
The Adventists still number fifteen or twenty thousand, the largest
body being in southern Michigan, but although they hold the doctrine
of the near advent of the final end, and endeavor to be at all times
ready, they no longer undertake to fix the date.

It may be noted here that the idea of a millennium, when the Messiah
shall come in person upon the earth and reign with the just for a
thousand years, was so firmly held by many of the early Christians that
it may almost be said to have formed a part of the doctrinal tradition
of the church. The belief was an inheritance from the Jews, many of
whose sacred writers taught that time was to endure through seven
great “years” of a thousand years each, the seventh and last being the
Sabbatical year or millennium, when their Messiah would appear and make
their kingdom the mistress of the world. For this materialistic view
of the millennium the Christian fathers substituted a belief in the
spiritual triumph of religion, when the armies of antichrist would be
annihilated, but the expectation of the return of Christ to rule in
person over his church before the last days was an essential part of
the doctrine, founded on numerous prophecies of both the Old and the
New Testament.


                            OTHER PARALLELS

                              BEEKMANITES

It would require a volume to treat of the various religious
abnormalisms, based on hypnotism, trances, and the messiah idea,
which have sprung up and flourished in different parts of our own
country even within the last twenty years. Naturally these delusions
thrived best among the ignorant classes, but there were some notable
exceptions, particularly in the case of the Beekmanites or “Church
of the Redeemed.” About 1875 Mrs Dora Beekman, the wife of a
Congregational minister in Rockford, Illinois, began preaching that
she was the immortal reincarnation of Jesus Christ. Absurd as this
claim may appear, she found those who believed her, and as her converts
increased in numbers they established their headquarters, which they
called “heaven,” near Rockford, built a church, and went zealously
to work to gather proselytes. Beekman refused to believe the new
doctrine, but being unable to convince his wife of her folly he was
finally driven to insanity. In the meantime the female Christ found an
able disciple in the Reverend George Schweinfurth, a young Methodist
minister of considerable cultivation and ability, who was installed as
bishop and apostle of the new sect. Mrs Beekman dying soon after, in
spite of her claim to immortality, Schweinfurth at once stepped into
her place, declaring that the Christly essence had passed from her into
himself. His claim was accepted, and when last heard from, about three
years ago, he was worshiped by hundreds of followers drawn from the
most prominent denominations of the vicinity as the risen Christ, the
lord of heaven and the immortal maker and ruler of the earth. (_J. F.
L., 6_, and current newspapers.)


                     PATTERSON AND BROWN’S MISSION

In 1888 a man named Patterson, in Soddy, a small town in eastern
Tennessee, began preaching that a wonderful thing was about to
happen, and after the matter had been talked about sufficiently for
his purpose, he announced that Christ had come in the person of A.
J. Brown, who had served as Patterson’s assistant. Later on Brown
disappeared, and it was announced that he had gone up into the mountain
to fast for forty days and nights in order to be fittingly prepared for
his mission. At the end of this period, on a Sunday morning in June,
his followers went out toward the hills, where he suddenly appeared
before them, clothed in white, with his hands uplifted. A great shout
went up, and the people rushed toward him, falling upon their knees
and kissing his feet. Many who were ill declared themselves healed by
his touch. So great was the fanaticism of these people that one girl
declared she was ready to die to prove her faith, and the nonbelievers
became so fearful that human life would be sacrificed that they sent
for the sheriff at Chattanooga, and it required all his power to compel
Patterson and Brown to leave the neighborhood that quiet might be
restored. (_J. F. L., 6._)


                         WILDERNESS WORSHIPERS

In 1889 and 1890 a remarkable messianic excitement developed among the
negroes along Savannah river in Georgia and South Carolina, where one
man after another proclaimed himself as Christ, promised miracles,
drew crowds of excited men and women from their work, and created a
general alarm among the white population of the whole section. The
most prominent of these Christs was a mulatto named Bell, who went
about preaching his divinity and exhorting all who would be saved to
give up everything and follow him. Hundreds of negroes abandoned the
cotton fields, the sawmills, and the turpentine woods to follow him,
obeying his every word and ready to fall down and worship him. They
assumed the name of “Wilderness Worshipers,” and set up in the woods
a “temple” consisting of a series of circular seats around an oak. The
excitement became so demoralizing and dangerous that Bell was finally
arrested. His frenzied disciples would have resisted the officers, but
he commanded them to be patient, declaring that he could not be harmed
and that an angel would come and open his prison doors by night. As
no specific charge could be formulated against him, he was released
after a short time, and continued his preaching to greater crowds than
before. At last he announced that the world would come to an end on
August 16, 1890; that all the negroes would then turn white and all
white men black, and that all who wished to ascend on the last day
must purchase wings from him. (_J. F. L., 6._) He was finally adjudged
insane and sent to the asylum. Successors arose in his place, however,
and kept up the excitement for a year afterward in spite of the efforts
of the authorities to put a stop to it. One of these claimed to be
King Solomon, while another asserted that he was Nebuchadnezzar, and
emphasized his claim by eating grass on all fours. In addition to
the “temple” in the woods they set up an “ark,” and were told by the
leaders that any persecutors who should sacrilegiously attempt to touch
it would fall down dead. Notwithstanding this warning, the officers
destroyed both ark and temple in their efforts to end the delusion. At
last a woman was killed by the enthusiasts, and a series of wholesale
arrests followed. King Solomon, Nebuchadnezzar, and others who were
clearly insane were sent to join Bell in the asylum, and the others
were released from custody after the excitement had waned.


                           HEAVENLY RECRUITS

Within the last five years various local revivalists have attracted
attention in different sections of Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri,
by their extravagances, among which prophecies, visions, trances, and
frenzied bodily exercises were all prominent. Particularly at the
meetings of the “Heavenly Recruits” in central Indiana, and at other
gatherings under the direction of Mrs Woodworth, cataleptic trances
were of nightly occurrence. The physical and mental demoralization
at last became so great that the meetings were suppressed by the
authorities.

From the beginning of history the dance and kindred physical exercises
have formed a part of the religious ritual of various oriental sects,
while hypnotic powers and practices have been claimed for their
priests. This is especially true of the Mohammedan sect or order of
the Dervishes, of which some account is given in the appendix to this
chapter.


         APPENDIX—HYPNOTISM AND THE DANCE AMONG THE DERVISHES

                       [From Brown’s Dervishes]

+Hypnotism.+—It is through the performance of the Zikr, by khalvet
(pious retirement for purposes of deep devotion), by the Tevejjuh
(or turning the face or mind devoutly toward God in prayer), by
the Murakebeh (or fearful contemplation of God), the Tesarruf (or
self-abandonment to pious reflection and inspiration), and the Tesavvuf
(or mystical spiritualism), that the fervent Dervish reaches peculiar
spiritual powers called _Kuvveh i roohee batinee_ (a mystical,
internal, spiritual power). The life or biography of every eminent
sheikh or peer details innumerable evidences of this power exercised
in a strange and peculiar manner. This exercise is called the Kuvveh
Iradat, or the “Power of the Will,” and, as a theory, may be traced
historically to the Divine Power—the soul of man being connected with
the Divine Spirit—from which it emanates, and with which, through
the means before mentioned, it commences. Some sheikhs are more
celebrated than others for their peculiar and strange powers, and it
is to their superiority that their reputation and reverence in the
Mussulman world in general, and among Dervishes in particular, is to
be attributed. With the supposition that the details given of them
by their biographers, disciples, or successors are not invented,
or even exaggerated, their powers are certainly very remarkable.
Whilst among them an implicit belief in them is firmly sustained,
sultans and princes have evidently doubted them, and, being alarmed
with the influence the possessors acquired and sustained among the
public generally, they have often shown a direful exercise of their
own arbitrary will and power, which resulted in the untimely end of
the unfortunate sheikh. Many, on the other hand, have survived the
frequent exercise of their “spiritual powers,” and either because they
acquired a power and influence over the minds of their temporal rulers,
or whether they used them for their own private purposes, so as to
conciliate the more religious or fanatic, they succeeded in reaching
advanced ages and a peaceful end of their remarkable careers. When the
ruler of the country has not cared to order the execution of the sheikh
who declared himself possessed of these spiritual powers, he has simply
exiled him from his capital or his territory, and permitted him freely
to exercise his powers and renown in some less objectionable locality.
These powers can only be acquired through the long instruction of a
superior spiritual director, or Murshid, or As-hâb i Yekeen, for whom
the disciples ever retain a most grateful remembrance and attachment.

Among the practices of these powers is the faculty of foreseeing coming
events; of predicting their occurrence; of preserving individuals from
the harm and evil which would otherwise certainly result for them;
of assuring to one person success over the machinations of another,
so that he may freely attack him and prevail over him; of restoring
harmony of sentiment between those who would otherwise be relentless
enemies; of knowing when others devised harm against themselves, and
through certain spells of preserving themselves and causing harm to
befall the evil minded, and even of causing the death of anyone against
whom they wish to proceed. All this is done as well from a distance as
when near.

In other parts of the world, and among other people, these attainments
would have been attributed to sorcery and witchcraft; in modern times
they would be ascribed to spiritism, or magnetic influences, either
of the spirit or of the body; but to the instructed Dervish they all
derive their origin in the spirit of the holy sheikh—the special gift
of the great Spirit of God, which commences with the spirit of man,
from which it directly emanated. The condition or disposition necessary
for these effects is called the Hâl (state or frame), and is much
the same as that required by the magnetized, and the object of his
operation. The powers of the body are enfeebled by fasting and mental
fatigue in prayer, and the imagination kept in a fervid state, fully
impressed with the conviction that such powers are really possessed by
the sheikh, and that he can readily exercise them over the willing
mind and body of the disciple. How the sheikh can produce such strange
results on a distant and unconscious person is left to the admiration
and imagination of the faithful disciple, as an incentive to exertions
in the same true path as that of his sheikh.

To exercise the power of the will, it is necessary to contract the
thoughts suddenly upon the object designed to be affected so perfectly
as to leave no room for the mind to dwell, possibly, upon any other.
The mind must not doubt for an instant of the success of this effort,
nor the possibility of failure; it must, in fact, be completely
absorbed by the one sole idea of performing the determination strongly
taken and firmly relied upon. The persons must, from time to time,
practice this; and as they proceed, they will be able to see how much
propinquity exists between themselves and the Hazret i Asmâ (God?) and
how much they are capable of exercising this power.

As an example, the author of the Reshihât narrates the following:

  In my youth, I was ever with our Lord Molânâ Sa’eed ed Deen
  Kâshgharee at Hereed. It happened that we, one day, walked out
  together and fell in with an assembly of the inhabitants of the
  place who were engaged in wrestling. To try our powers we agreed
  to aid with our “powers of the will” one of the wrestlers, so
  that the other should be overcome by him, and after doing so, to
  change our design in favor of the discomfited individual. So we
  stopped and, turning toward the parties, gave the full influence
  of our united wills to one, and immediately he was able to subdue
  his opponent. As the person we chose, each in turn, conquered the
  other, whichever we willed to prevail became the most powerful of
  the two, the power of our own wills was thus clearly manifested.

On another occasion two other persons possessed of these same powers
fell in with an assembly of people at a place occupied by prize
fighters. “To prevent any of the crowd from passing between and
separating us we joined our hands together. Two persons were engaged
fighting; one was a powerful man, while the other was a spare and weak
person. The former readily overcame the latter; and seeing this I
proposed to my companion to aid the weak one by the power of our wills.
So he bade me aid him in the project, while he concentrated his powers
upon the weaker person. Immediately a wonderful occurrence took place;
the thin, spare man seized his giant-like opponent and threw him on the
ground with surprising force. The crowd cried out with astonishment as
he turned him over on his back and held him down with apparent ease. No
one present except ourselves knew the cause. Seeing that my companion
was much affected by the effort which he had made, I bade him remark
how perfectly successful we had been, and adding that there was no
longer any necessity for our remaining there, we walked away.” (Pages
129–132.)

                   *       *       *       *       *

Many individuals who have seriously wronged and oppressed his friends
received punishments through the powers of the sheikh. Several
instances are related wherein some such even fell sick and died, or
were only restored to health by open declarations of repentance and
imploring his prayerful intercession with God. His spirit seems to
have accompanied those in whose welfare he took an active interest,
and enabled them to commune with him, though far distant from him.
His power of hearing them was well known to his friends, and several
instances are cited to prove the fact. His power of affecting the
health of those who injured him or his friends was greatly increased
while he was excited by anger, and on such occasions his whole frame
would be convulsed and his beard move about as if moved by electricity.
On learning details of cruelty done to innocent individuals, the sheikh
would be strangely affected, so much so that no one dared to address
him until the paroxysm was passed; and on such occasions he never
failed to commune spiritually with the sovereign or prince in such a
mysterious manner as to inspire him to deal justly with the guilty
person and secure his merited punishment.

Through his “mystical powers” many persons were impressed with the
unrighteousness of their course, and, having repented of the same,
became good and pious and firm believers in his spiritual influences.
These powers were always connected with his prayers, and it was during
these that he was enabled to assure the parties interested of their
salutary results and the acceptation of their desires. It scarcely
needs to be added, that these prayers were in conformance with
Islamism, and were offered up to Allah, whom he adored, and to whose
supreme will he attributes his powers. He constantly performed the Zikr
Jehree, or “audibly called God’s name,” and the frequent repetition of
this practice fitted him for such holy purposes. Sometimes he would
affect the mind of the individual upon whom he exercised his powers in
such a manner as to throw him into a species of trance, after which he
could remember nothing that he had previously known, and continued in
this state until the sheikh chose to restore him to the enjoyment of
his ordinary faculties. Notwithstanding all of these eminent powers,
this great sheikh is reputed to have spent the latter days of his life
at Herat in extreme indigence, much slighted and neglected by those who
had so admired him while in the vigor of his career. All fear of his
mystical influences seems to have disappeared, and it is narrated that
these greatly declined with his ordinary strength of mind and body.

+Dervish dance.+—The exercises which are followed in these halls are
of various kinds, according to the rules of each institution; but in
nearly all they commence by the recital, by the sheikh, of the seven
mysterious words of which we have spoken. He next chants various
passages of the Koran, and at each pause, the Dervishes, placed in a
circle round the hall, respond in chorus by the word “Allah!” or “Hoo!”
In some of the societies they sit on their heels, the elbows close to
those of each other, and all making simultaneously light movements of
the head and the body. In others, the movement consists in balancing
themselves slowly, from the right to the left, and from the left to the
right, or inclining the body methodically forward and aft. There are
other societies in which these motions commence seated, in measured
cadences, with a staid countenance, the eyes closed or fixed upon
the ground, and are continued on foot. These singular exercises are
concentrated under the name of Murâkebeh (exaltation of the Divine
glory), and also under that of the Tevheed (celebration of the Divine
unity), from which comes the name Tevheed Khâneh, given to the whole of
the halls devoted to these religious exercises.

In some of these institutions—such as the Kâdirees, the Rufâ′ees,
the Khalwettees, the Bairâmees, the Gulshenees, and the Ushâkees—the
exercises are made each holding the other by the hand, putting forward
always the right foot and increasing at every step the strength of
the movement of the body. This is called the Devr, which may be
translated the “dance” or “rotation.” The duration of these dances
is arbitrary—each one is free to leave when he pleases. Everyone,
however, makes it a point to remain as long as possible. The strongest
and most robust of the number, and the most enthusiastic, strive to
persevere longer than the others; they uncover their heads, take off
their turbans, form a second circle within the other, entwine their
arms within those of their brethren, lean their shoulders against
each other, gradually raise the voice, and without ceasing repeat “Yâ
Allah!” or “Yâ Hoo!” increasing each time the movement of the body, and
not stopping until their entire strength is exhausted.

Those of the order of the Rufâ′ees excel in these exercises. They
are, moreover, the only ones who use fire in their devotions. Their
practices embrace nearly all those of the other orders; they are
ordinarily divided into five different scenes, which last more than
three hours, and which are preceded, accompanied, and followed by
certain ceremonies peculiar to this order. The first commences with
praises which all the Dervishes offer to their sheikhs, seated before
the altar. Four of the more ancient come forward the first, and
approach their superior, embrace each other as if to give the kiss
of peace, and next place themselves two to his right and two to his
left. The remainder of the Dervishes, in a body, press forward in a
procession, all having their arms crossed and their heads inclined.
Each one, at first, salutes by a profound bow the tablet on which the
name of his founder is inscribed. Afterwards, putting his two hands
over his face and his beard, he kneels before the sheikh, kisses his
hand respectfully, and then they all go on with a grave step to take
their places on the sheepskins, which are spread in a half circle
around the interior of the hall. So soon as a circle is formed, the
Dervishes together chant the Tekbeer and the Fâtiha. Immediately
afterwards the sheikh pronounces the words “Lâ ilâha ill′ Allah!”
and repeats them incessantly; to which the Dervishes repeat “Allah!”
balancing themselves from side to side, and putting their hands over
their faces, on their breasts and their abdomens, and on their knees.

The second scene is opened by the Hamdee Mohammedee, a hymn in honour
of the prophet, chanted by one of the elders placed on the right of the
sheikh. During this chant the Dervishes continue to repeat the word
“Allah!” moving, however, their bodies forward and aft. A quarter of
an hour later they all rise up, approach each other, and press their
elbows against each other, balancing from right to left and afterwards
in a reverse motion, the right foot always firm, and the left in a
periodical movement, the reverse of that of the body, all observing
great precision of measure and cadence. In the midst of this exercise
they cry out the words “Yâ Allah!” followed by that of “Yâ Hoo!” Some
of the performers sigh, others sob, some shed tears, others perspire
great drops, and all have their eyes closed, their faces pale, and the
eyes languishing.

A pause of some minutes is followed by a third scene. It is performed
in the middle of an Ilahee, chanted by the two elders on the right
of the sheikh. The Ilahees, as has already been said, are spiritual
cantiques, composed almost exclusively in Persian, by sheikhs deceased
in the odor of sanctity. The Dervishes then hasten their movements,
and, to prevent any relaxation, one of the first among them puts
himself in their center, and excites them by his example. If in the
assembly there be any strange Dervishes, which often happens, they
give them, through politeness, this place of honor; and all fill it
successively, the one after the other, shaking themselves as aforesaid.
The only exception made is in favor of the Mevevees; these never
perform any other dance than that peculiar to their own order, which
consists in turning round on each heel in succession.

After a new pause commences the fourth scene. Now all the Dervishes
take off their turbans, form a circle, bare their arms and shoulders
against each other, and thus make the circuit of the hall at a measured
pace, striking their feet at intervals against the floor, and all
springing up at once. This dance continues during the Ilahees chanted
alternately by the two elders to the left of the sheikh. In the midst
of this chant the cries of “Yâ Allah!” are increased doubly, as also
those of “Yâ Hoo!” with frightful howlings, shrieked by the Dervishes
together in the dance. At the moment that they would seem to stop
from sheer exhaustion the sheikh makes a point of exerting them to
new efforts by walking through their midst, making also himself most
violent movements. He is next replaced by the two elders, who double
the quickness of the step and the agitation of the body; they even
straighten themselves up from time to time, and excite the envy or
emulation of the others in their astonishing efforts to continue the
dance until their strength is entirely exhausted.

The fourth scene leads to the last, which is the most frightful of
all, the wholly prostrated condition of the actors becoming converted
into a species of ecstasy which they call Halet. It is in the midst of
this abandonment of self, or rather of religious delirium, that they
make use of red-hot irons. Several cutlasses and other instruments
of sharp-pointed iron are suspended in the niches of the hall, and
upon a part of the wall to the right of the sheikh. Near the close
of the fourth scene two Dervishes take down eight or nine of these
instruments, heat them red hot, and present them to the sheikh. He,
after reciting some prayers over them, and invoking the founder of the
order, Ahmed er Rufâ′ee, breathes over them, and raising them slightly
to the mouth, gives them to the Dervishes, who ask for them with the
greatest eagerness. Then it is that these fanatics, transported by
frenzy, seize upon these irons, gloat upon them tenderly, lick them,
bite them, hold them between their teeth, and end by cooling them
in their mouths. Those who are unable to procure any seize upon the
cutlasses hanging on the wall with fury, and stick them into their
sides, arms, and legs.

Thanks to the fury of their frenzy, and to the amazing boldness which
they deem a merit in the eyes of the Divinity, all stoically bear
up against the pain which they experience with apparent gaiety.
If, however, some of them fall under their sufferings, they throw
themselves into the arms of their confrères, but without a complaint or
the least sign of pain. Some minutes after this, the sheikh walks round
the hall, visits each one of the performers in turn, breathes upon
their wounds, rubs them with saliva, recites prayers over them, and
promises them speedy cures. It is said that twenty-four hours afterward
nothing is to be seen of their wounds. (Pages 218–222.)

There was no regularity in their dancing, but each seemed to be
performing the antics of a madman; now moving his body up and down;
the next moment turning round, then using odd gesticulations with his
arms, next jumping, and sometimes screaming; in short, if a stranger
observing them was not told that this was the involuntary effect of
enthusiastic excitement, he would certainly think that these Durweeshes
were merely striving to excel one another in playing the buffoon. (Page
260.)

+The fit.+—After this preface, the performers began the Zikr. Sitting
in the manner above described, they chanted, in slow measure, _Lá iláha
illa ’lláh_ (there is no deity but God), to the following air: _Lá i-lá
hailla-lláh. Lá i-lá-ha-illa-l-lá-h. Lá i-lá ha illa-l-láh._ Bowing the
head twice on each repetition of “_Lá iláha illa ’lláh_.” Thus they
continued about a quarter of an hour, and then, for about the same
space of time, they repeated the same words to the same air, but in a
quicker measure, and with correspondingly quicker motion....

They next rose, and, standing in the same order in which they had
been sitting, repeated the same words to another air. During this
stage of their performance they were joined by a tall, well-dressed,
black slave, whose appearance induced me to inquire who he was. I was
informed that he was a eunuch, belonging to the basha. The Zikkeers,
still standing, next repeated the same words in a very deep and hoarse
tone, laying the principal emphasis upon the word “Lá,” and the first
syllable of the last word, Allah, and uttering, apparently with a
considerable effort. The sound much resembled that which is produced
by beating the rim of a tambourine. Each Zikkeer turned his head
alternately to the right and left at each repetition of “_Lá iláha illa
’lláh_.” The eunuch above mentioned, during this part of the Zikr,
became what is termed _melboos_, or “possessed.” Throwing his arms
about, and looking up with a very wild expression of countenance, he
exclaimed, in a very high tone and with great vehemence and rapidity,
_Allah! Allah! Allah! Allah! Allah! la! la! la! la! la! la! la! la! la!
la! la! la! láh! Yá‛ammee! Yá‛ammee! Yá‛ammee! Ashmáwee! Yá Ashmáwee!
Yá Ashmáwee!_ (_Yá‛ammee_ signifies O, my uncle!) His voice gradually
became faint, and when he had uttered those words, though he was held
by a Durweesh who was next him, he fell on the ground, foaming at the
mouth, his eyes closed, his limbs convulsed, and his fingers clenched
over his thumbs. It was an epileptic fit. No one could see it and
believe it to be the effect of feigned emotions; it was undoubtedly the
result of a high state of religious excitement. Nobody seemed surprised
at it, for occurrences of this kind at Zikrs are not uncommon. All the
performers now appeared much excited, repeating their ejaculations
with greater rapidity, violently turning their heads, and sinking the
whole body at the same time, some of them jumping. The eunuch became
_melboos_ again several times, and I generally remarked that his
fits happened after one of the Moonshids had sung a line or two, and
exerted himself more than usually to excite his hearers. The singing
was, indeed, to my taste, very pleasing. Toward the close of the Zikr
a private soldier, who had joined through the whole performance, also
seemed several times to be _melboos_, growling in a horrible manner and
violently shaking his head from side to side. The contrast presented
by the vehement and distressing exertions of the performers at the
close of the Zikr, and their calm gravity and solemnity of manner at
the commencement, was particularly striking. Money was collected during
the performance for the Moonshid. The Zikkeers receive no pay. (Pages
252–255.)




                               THE SONGS


                             INTRODUCTORY

The Ghost-dance songs are of the utmost importance in connection with
the study of the messiah religion, as we find embodied in them much
of the doctrine itself, with more of the special tribal mythologies,
together with such innumerable references to old-time customs,
ceremonies, and modes of life long since obsolete as make up a regular
symposium of aboriginal thought and practice. There is no limit to
the number of these songs, as every trance at every dance produces a
new one, the trance subject after regaining consciousness embodying
his experience in the spirit world in the form of a song, which is
sung at the next dance and succeeding performances until superseded
by other songs originating in the same way. Thus, a single dance may
easily result in twenty or thirty new songs. While songs are thus born
and die, certain ones which appeal especially to the Indian heart, on
account of their mythology, pathos, or peculiar sweetness, live and
are perpetuated. There are also with each tribe certain songs which
are a regular part of the ceremonial, as the opening song and the
closing song, which are repeated at every dance. Of these the closing
song is the most important and permanent. In some cases certain songs
constitute a regular series, detailing the experiences of the same
person in successive trance visions. First in importance, for number,
richness of reference, beauty of sentiment, and rhythm of language, are
the songs of the Arapaho.

                          SKETCH OF THE TRIBE

The Arapaho, with their subtribe, the Gros Ventres, are one of the
westernmost tribes of the wide-extending Algonquian stock. According to
their oldest traditions they formerly lived in northeastern Minnesota
and moved westward in company with the Cheyenne, who at that time
lived on the Cheyenne fork of Red river. From the earliest period the
two tribes have always been closely confederated, so that they have
no recollection of a time when they were not allies. In the westward
migration the Cheyenne took a more southerly direction toward the
country of the Black hills, while the Arapaho continued more nearly
westward up the Missouri. The Arapaho proper probably ascended on
the southern side of the river, while the Gros Ventres went up the
northern bank and finally drifted off toward the Blackfeet, with whom
they have ever since been closely associated, although they have on
several occasions made long visits, extending sometimes over several
years, to their southern relatives, by whom they are still regarded
as a part of the “Inûna-ina.” The others continued on to the great
divide between the waters of the Missouri and those of the Columbia,
then turning southward along the mountains, separated finally into two
main divisions, the northern Arapaho continuing to occupy the head
streams of the Missouri and the Yellowstone, in Montana and Wyoming,
while the southern Arapaho made their camps on the head of the Platte,
the Arkansas, and the Canadian, in Colorado and the adjacent states,
frequently joining the Comanche and Kiowa in their raids far down into
Mexico. From their earliest recollection, until put on reservations,
they have been at war with the Shoshoni, Ute, Pawnee, and Navaho, but
have generally been friendly with their other neighbors. The southern
Arapaho and Cheyenne have usually acted in concert with the Comanche,
Kiowa, and Kiowa Apache.

They recognize among themselves five original divisions, each having a
different dialect. They are here given in the order of their importance:

1. _Na′kasinĕ′na_, _Ba′achinĕna_ or _Northern Arapaho_. Nakasinĕna,
“sagebrush men,” is the original name of this portion of the tribe
and the divisional name used by themselves. The name Baachinĕna, by
which they are commonly known to the rest of the tribe, is more
modern and may mean “red willow (i. e., kinikinik) men,” or possibly
“blood-pudding men,” the latter meaning said to have been an allusion
to a kind of sausage formerly made by this band. They are commonly
known as northern Arapaho, to distinguish them from the other large
division living now in Oklahoma. The Kiowa distinguished them as
Tägyä′ko, “sagebrush people,” a translation of their proper name,
Baachinĕna. Although not the largest division, the Baachinĕna claim to
be the “mother people” of the Arapaho, and have in their keeping the
grand medicine of the tribe, the sĕicha or sacred pipe.

2. _Na′wunĕna_, “southern men,” or _Southern Arapaho_, called
_Nawathi′nĕha_, “southerners,” by the northern Arapaho. This latter
is said to be the archaic form. The southern Arapaho, living now in
Oklahoma, constitute by far the larger division, although subordinate
in the tribal sociology to the northern Arapaho. In addition to their
everyday dialect, they are said to have an archaic dialect, some words
of which approximate closely to Cheyenne.

3. _Aä′ninĕna_, _Hitu′nĕna_, or _Gros Ventres of the Prairie_. The
first name, said to mean “white clay people” (from _aäti_, “white
clay”), is that by which they call themselves. Hitunĕna or Hitunĕnina,
“begging men,” “beggars,” or, more exactly, “spongers,” is the name by
which they are called by the other Arapaho, on account, as these latter
claim, of their propensity for filling their stomachs at the expense of
someone else. The same idea is intended to be conveyed by the tribal
sign, which signifies “belly people,” not “big bellies” (Gros Ventres),
as rendered by the French Canadian trappers. The Kiowa call them
Bot-k̔iñ′ago, “belly men.” By the Shoshoni, also, they are known as
Sä′pani, “bellies,” while the Blackfeet call them Atsina, “gut people.”
The Ojibwa call them Bahwetegow-ēninnewug, “fall people,” according
to Tanner, whence they have sometimes been called Fall Indians or
Rapid Indians, from their former residence about the rapids of the
Saskatchewan. To the Sioux they are known as Sku′tani. Lewis and Clark
improperly call them “Minnetarees of Fort de Prairie.” The Hidatsa or
Minitari are sometimes known as Gros Ventres of the Missouri.

4. _Bä′sawunĕ′na_, “wood lodge men,” or, according to another
authority, “big lodge people.” These were formerly a distinct tribe and
at war with the other Arapaho. They are represented as having been a
very foolish people in the old times, and many absurd stories are told
of them, in agreement with the general Indian practice of belittling
conquered or subordinate tribes. They have been incorporated with the
northern Arapaho for at least a hundred and fifty years, according to
the statements of the oldest men of that band. Their dialect is said to
have differed very considerably from the other Arapaho dialects. There
are still about one hundred of this lineage among the northern Arapaho,
and perhaps a few others with the two other main divisions. Weasel
Bear, the present keeper of the sacred pipe, is of the Bäsawunĕna.

5. _Ha’nahawunĕna_ or _Aanû’hawă_ (meaning unknown). These, like the
Bäsawunĕna, lived with the northern Arapaho, but are now practically
extinct.

                   *       *       *       *       *

There seems to be no possible trace of a clan or gentile system among
the Arapaho, and the same remark holds good of the Cheyenne, Kiowa,
and Comanche. It was once assumed that all Indian tribes had the clan
system, but later research shows that it is lacking over wide areas in
the western territory. It is very doubtful if it exists at all among
the prairie tribes generally. Mr Ben Clark, who has known and studied
the Cheyenne for half a lifetime, states positively that they have no
clans, as the term is usually understood. This agrees with the result
of personal investigations and the testimony of George Bent, a Cheyenne
half-blood, and the best living authority on all that relates to his
tribe. With the eastern tribes, however, and those who have removed
from the east or the timbered country, as the Caddo, the gentile system
is so much a part of their daily life that it is one of the first
things to attract the attention of the observer.

In regard to the tribal camping circle, common to most of the prairie
tribes, the Arapaho state that on account of their living in three
main divisions they have had no common camping circle within their
recollection, but that each of these three divisions constituted a
single circle when encamped in one place.

Among the northern Arapaho, on the occasion of every grand gathering,
the sacred pipe occupied a special large tipi in the center of the
circle, and the taking down of this tipi by the medicine keeper was the
signal to the rest of the camp to prepare to move. On the occasion of a
visit of several hundred Cheyenne and Arapaho to the Kiowa and Comanche
at Anadarko, in the summer of 1892, each of the visiting tribes camped
in a separate circle adjacent to the other. The opening of the circle,
like the door of each tipi, always faces the east.

Under the name of Kanenăvish the Arapaho proper are mentioned by Lewis
and Clark in 1805, as living southwest of the Black hills. As a tribe
they have not been at war with the whites since 1868, and took no
part in the outbreak of the Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Comanche in 1874. At
present they are in three main divisions. First come the Gros Ventres,
numbering 718 in 1892, associated with the Asiniboin on Fort Belknap
reservation in Montana. There are probably others of this band with
the Blackfeet on the British side of the line. Next come the northern
Arapaho, numbering 829, associated with the Shoshoni on Wind River
reservation in Wyoming. They were placed on this reservation in 1876,
after having made peace with the Shoshoni, their hereditary enemy,
in 1869. They are divided into three bands, the “Forks of the River
Men” under Black Coal, the head chief of the whole division; the “Bad
Pipes” under Short Nose, and the “Greasy Faces” under Spotted Horse.
The third division, the southern Arapaho, associated with the Cheyenne
in Oklahoma, constitute the main body of the tribe and numbered 1,091
in 1892. They have five bands: 1, Wa′quithi, “bad faces,” the principal
band and the one to which the head chief, Left Hand, belongs; 2,
Aqa′thinĕ′na, “pleasant men;” 3, Gawunĕ′na or Ga′wunĕhäna (Kawinahan,
“black people”—_Hayden_), “Blackfeet,” so called because said to be
of part Blackfoot blood, the same name being applied to the Blackfoot
tribe; 4, Ha′qihana, “wolves,” because they had a wolf (not coyote)
for medicine; 5, Säsa′bä-ithi, “looking up,” or according to another
authority, “looking around, i. e., watchers or lookouts.” Under the
treaty of Medicine Lodge in 1867, they and the southern Cheyenne were
placed on the reservation which they sold in 1890 to take allotments
and become citizens. Their present chief is Left Hand (Nawat), who
succeeded the celebrated Little Raven (Hosa) a few years ago. The whole
number of the Arapaho and Gros Ventres, including a few in eastern
schools, is about 2,700.

[Illustration: +Fig. 88+—Arapaho tipi and windbreak.]

Until very recently the Arapaho have been a typical prairie tribe,
living in skin tipis and following the buffalo in its migrations, yet
they retain a tradition of a time when they were agricultural. They are
of a friendly, accommodating disposition, religious and contemplative,
without the truculent, pugnacious character that belongs to their
confederates, the Cheyenne, although they have always proven themselves
brave warriors. They are also less mercenary and more tractable than
the prairie Indians generally, and having now recognized the inevitable
of civilization have gone to work in good faith to make the best of
it. Their religious nature has led them to take a more active interest
in the Ghost dance, which, together with the rhythmic character of
their language, has made the Arapaho songs the favorite among all the
tribes of Oklahoma. The chief study of the Ghost dance was made among
the Arapaho, whom the author visited six times for this purpose. One
visit was made to those in Wyoming, the rest of the time being spent
with the southern branch of the tribe.


                         SONGS OF THE ARAPAHO


                 1. +Opening Song—Eyehe′! nä′nisa′na.+

[Music]

    Eyehe′! nä′nisa′na,
    Eyehe′! nä′nisa′na,
    Hi′nä chä′să′ äticha′nĭ′na He′eye′!
    Hi′nä chä′să′ äticha′nĭ′na He′eye′!
    Na′hăni nä′nithä′tuhŭ′na He′eye′!
    Na′hăni nä′nithä′tuhŭ′na He′eye′!
    Bi′taa′wu′ da′naa′bäna′wa He′eye′!
    Bi′taa′wu′ da′naa′bäna′wa He′eye′!

                             _Translation_

    O, my children! O, my children!
    Here is another of your pipes—_He′eye′!_
    Here is another of your pipes—_He′eye′!_
    Look! thus I shouted—_He′eye′!_
    Look! thus I shouted—_He′eye′!_
    When I moved the earth—_He′eye′!_
    When I moved the earth—_He′eye′!_

This opening song of the Arapaho Ghost dance originated among the
northern Arapaho in Wyoming and was brought down to the southern branch
of the tribe by the first apostles of the new religion. By “another
pipe” is probably meant the newer revelation of the messiah, the pipe
being an important feature of all sacred ceremonies, and all their
previous religious tradition, having centered about the sĕicha or flat
pipe, to be described hereafter. The pipe, however, was not commonly
carried in the dance, as was the case among the Sioux. In this song, as
in many others of the Ghost dance, the father or messiah, _Hesûna′nin_,
is supposed to be addressing “my children,” _nänisa′na_. The tune
is particularly soft and pleasing, and the song remains a standard
favorite. The second reference is to the new earth which is supposed to
be already moving rapidly forward to slide over and take the place of
this old and worn-out creation.


                      2. +Sĕ′icha hei′ta′wuni′na+

      Sĕ′icha′ hei′ta′wuni′na—E′yahe′eye,
      Sĕ′icha′ hei′ta′wuni′na—E′yahe′eye.
            He′sûna′nini—Yahe′eye′,

    Ûtnitha′wuchä′wahănänina—E′yahe′eye′,
    Ûtnitha′wuchä′wahănänina—E′yahe′eye′.
            He′sana′nini—E′yahe′eye,
            He′sana′nini—E′yahe′eye.

                             _Translation_

                The sacred pipe tells me—_E′yahe′eye!_

                      Our father—_Yahe′eye′!_
                      Our father—_Yahe′eye′!_
    We shall surely be put again (with our friends)—_E′yahe′eye!_
    We shall surely be put again (with our friends)—_E′yahe′eye!_

                      Our father—_E′yahe′eye!_

The sĕicha or flat pipe is the sacred tribal medicine of the Arapaho.
According to the myth it was given to their ancestors at the beginning
of the world after the Turtle had brought the earth up from under the
water. It was delivered to them by the Duck, which was discovered
swimming about on the top of the water after the emergence of the land.
At the same time they were given an ear of corn, from which comes
all the corn of the world. The Arapaho lost the art of agriculture
when they came out upon the buffalo plains, but the sacred pipe the
Turtle long since changed to stone, and the first ear of corn, also
transformed to stone, they have cherished to this day as their great
medicine. The pipe, turtle, and ear of corn are preserved among the
northern Arapaho in Wyoming, who claim to be the “mother people” of the
tribe. They are handed down in the keeping of a particular family from
generation to generation, the present priestly guardian being Se′hiwûq,
“Weasel Bear” (from _sea_, weasel, and _wûq_, bear; the name has also
been rendered “Gray Bear,” from _se_, gray, and _wûq_, bear), of the
Bäsawunĕ′na division.

The three sacred things are preserved carefully wrapped in deerskins,
and are exposed only on rare occasions, always within the sacred tipi
and in the presence of but a small number of witnesses, who take this
opportunity to smoke the sacred pipe and pray for the things which
they most desire. The pipe itself is of stone, and is described as
apparently made in double, one part being laid over the other like
the bark of a tree, the outer part of both bowl and stem being of
the regular red pipestone, while the inner part of both is of white
stone. The stem is only about 10 inches long, while the bowl is large
and heavy, with the characteristic projection for resting the end
upon the ground. Both bowl and stem are rounded, but with a flange
of perhaps an inch in width along each side of the stem and up along
the bowl. From this comes its name of sĕicha, or “flat pipe.” When
exposed on such occasions, the devotees sit around the fire in a
circle, when the bundle is opened upon the ground so that all may see
the sacred objects. The medicine keeper then lights the pipe and after
taking one or two whiffs passes it to the one next him, who takes a
single whiff and passes it on to the next. It thus goes sunwise (?)
around the circle. In taking the sĕicha the devotees do not grasp the
stem, as when smoking on other occasions, but receive it upon the
outstretched palm of the right hand, smoke, and pass it on around the
circle. The flanges along the side of the pipe allow it to rest flat
upon the hand. After all have smoked, the priest recites the genesis
myth of the origin of the land, and the manner in which the pipe and
the corn were given to their ancestors. The corresponding myth of the
Cheyenne occupies “four smokes” (i. e., four consecutive nights) in
the delivery, but I am unable to state whether or not this is the case
with the Arapaho. So sacred is this tradition held that no one but the
priest of the pipe dares to recite it, for fear of divine punishment
should the slightest error be made in the narration. At the close of
the recital the devotees send up their prayers for the blessings of
which they stand most in need, after which the priest again carefully
wraps up the sacred objects in the skins. Before leaving the lodge the
worshipers cover the bundle with their offerings of blankets or other
valuables, which are taken by the medicine keeper as his fee.

When encamped in the tribal circle, the sacred pipe and its keeper
occupied a large tipi, reserved especially for this purpose, which
was set up within the circle and near its western line, directly
opposite the doorway on the east. In the center of the circle, between
the doorway and the sacred tipi, was erected the sweat-house of the
_Chi′nachichinĕ′na_ or old men of the highest degree of the warrior
order. The taking down of the sacred tipi by the attendants of the pipe
keeper was the signal for moving camp, and no other tipi was allowed to
be taken down before it. When on the march, the pipe keeper proceeded
on foot—never on horse—carrying the sacred bundle upon his back and
attended by a retinue of guards. As a matter of course, the sacred
pipe was not carried by war parties or on other expeditions requiring
celerity of movement. Of late years the rules have so far relaxed that
its present guardian sometimes rides on horseback while carrying the
pipe, but even then he carries the bundle upon his own back instead of
upon the saddle. He never rides in a wagon with it. Since the tribe is
permanently divided under the modern reservation system, individuals or
small parties of the southern Arapaho frequently make the long journey
by railroad and stage to the reservation in Wyoming in order to see and
pray over the sĕicha, as it is impossible, on account of the ceremonial
regulations, for the keeper to bring it down to them in the south.

So far as known, only one white man, Mr J. Roberts, formerly
superintendent of the Arapaho school in Wyoming, has ever seen the
sacred pipe, which was shown to him on one occasion by Weasel Bear as
a special mark of gratitude in return for some kindness. After having
spent several months among the southern Arapaho, from whom I learned
the songs of the pipe with much as to its sacred history, I visited the
messiah in Nevada and then went to the northern Arapaho in Wyoming,
with great hope of seeing the sĕicha and hearing the tradition in full.
On the strength of my intimate acquaintance with their relatives in the
south and with their great messiah in the west, the chiefs and head-men
were favorable to my purpose and encouraged me to hope, but on going
out to the camp in the mountains, where nearly the whole tribe was
then assembled cutting wood, my hopes were dashed to the ground the
first night by hearing the old priest, Weasel Bear, making the public
announcement in a loud voice throughout the camp that a white man was
among them to learn about their sacred things, but that these belonged
to the religion of the Indian and a white man had no business to ask
about them. The chief and those who had been delegates to the messiah
came in soon after to the tipi where I was stopping, to express their

Bear, and none of themselves would venture to repeat the tradition.

This song referring to the whites was composed by Nawat or Left Hand,
chief of the southern Arapaho, and can hardly be considered dangerous
or treasonable in character. According to his statement, in his trance
vision of the other world the father showed him extensive orchards,
telling him that in the beginning all these things had been given to
the whites, but that hereafter they would be given to his children, the
Indians. _Nia′tha_, plural _Nia′thuă_, the Arapaho name for the whites,
signifies literally, expert, skillful, or wise.

    Let us go out gambling,
    At _chi′chita′nĕ_, at _chi′chita′nĕ_.

_Chi′chita′nĕ_ is a favorite game of contest with the boys, in which
the player, while holding in his hands a bow and an arrow ready to
shoot, keeps in the hand which grasps the string a small wisp of grass
bound with sinew. He lets this drop and tries to shoot it with the
arrow before it touches the ground. The wisp is about the size of a
man’s finger.

The song came from the north, and was suggested by a trance vision in
which the dreamer saw his former boy friends playing this game in the
spirit world.

This song relates the trance experience of Waqui′si or “Ugly Face
Woman.” In his vision of the spirit world he went into a large Arapaho
camp, where he met his dead father, who took him around to the various
tipis to meet others of his departed friends. While they were thus
going about, a change came o’er the spirit of his dream, as so often
happens in this fevered mental condition, and instead of his father
he found a moose standing by his side. Such transformations are
frequently noted in the Ghost-dance songs.

    _E′yehe′!_ they are new—

    The bed coverings,

The composer of this song is a woman who, in her trance, was taken to a
large camp where all the tipis were of clean new buffalo skins, and the
beds and interior furniture were all in the same condition.

[Illustration: +Fig. 89+—Bed of the prairie tribes.]

[Illustration: +Fig. 90+—Shinny stick and ball.]

[Illustration: +Fig. 91+—Wakuna or head-feathers.]

The bed of the prairie tribes is composed of slender willow rods,
peeled, straightened with the teeth, laid side by side and fastened
together into a sort of mat by means of buckskin or rawhide strings
passed through holes at the ends of the rods. The bed is stretched upon
a platform raised about a foot above the ground, and one end of the
mat is raised up in hammock fashion by means of a tripod and buckskin
hanger. The rods laid across the platform, forming the bed proper, are
usually about 3½ or 4 feet long (the width of the bed), while those
forming the upright part suspended from the tripod are shorter as they
approach the top, where they are only about half that length. The bed
is bordered with buckskin binding fringed and beaded, and the exposed
rods are painted in bright colors. The hanging portion is distinct
from the part resting upon the platform, and in some cases there is a
hanger at each end of the bed. Over the platform portion are spread
the buckskins and blankets, which form a couch by day and a bed by
night. A pillow of buckskin, stuffed with buffalo hair and elaborately
ornamented with beads or porcupine quills, is sometimes added. The
bed is placed close up under the tipi. In the largest tipis there are
usually three beds, one being opposite the doorway and the others on
each side, the fire being built in a hole scooped out in the ground in
the center of the lodge. They are used as seats during waking hours,
while the ground, with a rawhide spread upon it, constitutes the only
table at meal time (plate +CXXI+; figure 89). In going to bed there
is no undressing, each person as he becomes sleepy simply stretching
out and drawing a blanket over himself, head and all, while the other
occupants of the tipi continue their talking, singing, or other
business until they too lie down to pleasant dreams.

This song refers to the woman’s game of _gû‛gă′hawa′t_ or “shinny,”
played with curved sticks and a ball like a baseball, called
_gaawă′ha_, made of (buffalo) hair and covered with buckskin (figure
90). Two stakes are set up as goals at either end of the ground, and
the object of each party is to drive the ball through the goals of the
other. Each inning is a game. The song was composed by a woman, who met
her former girl comrade in the spirit world and played this game with
her against an opposing party.

By the _wakuna_ or head-feathers (figure 91) is meant the two crow
feathers mounted on a short stick and worn on the head by the leaders
of the dance, as already described.

This song was brought from the north to the southern Arapaho by Sitting
Bull. It refers to the trance vision of a dancer, who saw the messiah
advancing at the head of all the spirit army. It is an old favorite,
and is sung with vigor and animation.


                  10. +Häna′na′wunănu ni′tawu′na′na′+

    I take pity on those who have been taught,
    Because they push on hard,
    Because they push on hard.
    Says our father,
    Says our father.

This is a message from the messiah to persevere in the dance. In the
expressive idiom of the prairie tribes, as also in the sign language,
the term for persevering signifies to “push hard.”


                    11. +A-ni′qu wa′wanä′nibä′tia′+

    That loudest song of all,
    That loudest song of all—
    That resounding song—_Hi′ni′ni!_
    That resounding song—_Hi′ni′ni!_

This is another of the old favorites. The rolling effect of the vocalic
Arapaho syllables renders it particularly sonorous when sung by a
full chorus. _Ni′qa_ or _a-ni′qu_, “father,” is a term of reverential
affection, about equivalent to “our father” in the Lord’s prayer. The
ordinary word is _hesûna′nin_, from _nisû′na_, “my father.”

    Tonight as I ride with my load of buffalo beef.

The author of this song, on meeting his friends in the spirit world,
found them preparing to go on a great buffalo hunt, the prairies of the
new earth being covered with the countless thousands of buffalo that
have been swept from the plains since the advent of the white man. They
returned to camp at night, under the full moonlight, with their ponies
loaded down with fresh beef. There is something peculiarly touching in
this dream of the old life—this Indian heaven where—

    “In meadows wet with moistening dews,
      In garments for the chase arrayed,
    The hunter still the deer pursues—
      The hunter and the deer a shade.”

    I am singing it,

    _He′yäya′ahe′ye!
    He′yäya′ahe′ye!_

The cottonwood (_Populus monilifera_) is the most characteristic tree
of the plains and of the arid region between the Rockies and the
Sierras. It is a species of poplar and takes its name from the white
downy blossom fronds, resembling cotton, which come out upon it in the
spring. The cottonwood and a species of stunted oak, with the mesquite
in the south, are almost the only trees to be found upon the great
plains extending from the Saskatchewan southward into Texas. As it
never grows out upon the open, but always close along the borders of
the few streams, it is an unfailing indication of water either on or
near the surface, in a region well-nigh waterless. Between the bark
and the wood there is a sweet milky juice of which the Indians are
very fond—as one who had been educated in the east said, “It is their
ice cream”—and they frequently strip off the bark and scrape the trunk
in order to procure it. Horses also are fond of this sweet juice, and
in seasons when the grass has been burned off or is otherwise scarce,
the Indian ponies sometimes resort to the small twigs and bark of
the cottonwood to sustain life. In extreme cases their owners have
sometimes been driven to the same shift. In winter the camps of the
prairie tribes are removed from the open prairie to the shelter of the
cottonwood timber along the streams. The tree is held almost sacred,
and the sun-dance lodge is usually or always constructed of cottonwood
saplings.

    The young Thunderbirds,
    The young Thunderbirds.

Among the Algonquian tribes of the east, the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho,
Kiowa, Comanche, and prairie tribes generally, as well as among those
of the northwest coast and some parts of Mexico, thunder and lightning
are produced by a great bird, whose shadow is the thunder cloud, whose
flapping wings make the sound of thunder, and whose flashing eyes
rapidly opening or closing send forth the lightning. Among some tribes
of the northwest this being is not a bird, but a giant who puts on a
dress of bird skin with head, wings, and all complete, by means of
which he flies through the air when in search of his prey. The myth is
not found among the Iroquois or the Cherokee, or, perhaps, among the
Muskhogean tribes.

The Thunderbird usually has his dwelling on some high mountain or
rocky elevation of difficult access. Within the territory of the myth
several places are thus designated as the Thunder’s Nest. Thunder bay
of Lake Huron, in lower Michigan, derives its name in this way. Such a
place, known to the Sioux as _Waqkiñ′a-oye′_, “The Thunder’s Nest,” is
within the old territory of the Sisseton Sioux in eastern South Dakota
in the neighborhood of Big Stone lake. At another place, near the
summit of the Coteau des Prairies, in eastern South Dakota, a number of
large round bowlders are pointed out as the eggs of the Thunderbird.
According to the Comanche there is a place on upper Red river where
the Thunderbird once alighted on the ground, the spot being still
identified by the fact that the grass remains burned off over a space
having the outline of a large bird with outstretched wings. The same
people tell how a hunter once shot and wounded a large bird which fell
to the ground. Being afraid to attack it alone on account of its size,
he returned to camp for help, but on again approaching the spot the
hunters heard the thunder rolling and saw flashes of lightning shooting
out from the ravine where the bird lay wounded. On coming nearer, the
lightning blinded them so that they could not see the bird, and one
flash struck and killed a hunter. His frightened companions then fled
back to camp, for they knew it was the Thunderbird.

[Illustration: +Fig. 92+—The Thunderbird.]

With both Cheyenne and Arapaho the thunder (_ba′a′_) is a large bird,
with a brood of smaller ones, and carries in its talons a number of
arrows with which it strikes the victim of lightning. For this reason
they call the eagle on our coins _baa_. When it thunders, they say
_ba′a′ nänitŭ′hut_, “the thunder calls.” In Indian pictography the
Thunderbird is figured with zigzag lines running out from its heart to
represent the lightning. A small figure of it (represented in figure
92), cut from rawhide and ornamented with beads, is frequently worn on
the heads of the dancers.

The idea expressed in this song is that the dreamer “rides the
whirlwind” in order sooner to meet the messiah and the spirit hosts.
Father or grandfather are terms of reverence and affection, applied to
anything held sacred or awful.

This song probably refers to the Thunderbird. There is an energetic
swing to the tune that makes it a favorite. In Indian belief the earth
is a circular disk, usually surrounded on all sides by water, and
the sky is a solid concave hemisphere coming down at the horizon to
the level of the earth. In Cherokee and other Indian myth the sky is
continually lifting up and coming down again to the earth, like the
upper blade of the scissors. The sun, which lives upon the outside
of this hemisphere, comes through from the east in the morning while
there is a momentary opening between the earth and the edge of the sky,
climbs along upon the underside of the sky from east to west, and goes
out at the western horizon in the evening, to return during the night
to its starting point in the east.

The author of this song met in the spirit world a man of the now
extinct Arapaho band of the _Hanahawunĕna_, who washed the face of the
visitor and then painted him afresh with some of the old-time mineral
paint of the Indians. In accord with the Indian belief, all the extinct
and forgotten tribes have now their home in the world of shades.

    _He′yahe′eỹe′!_

This song was composed by Paul Boynton (Bääku′ni, “Red Feather”), a
Carlisle student, after having been in a trance. His brother had died
some time before, and being told by the Indians that he might be able
to see and talk with him by joining the dance, Paul went to Sitting
Bull, the leader of the dance, at the next gathering, and asked him to
help him to see his dead brother. The result was that he was hypnotized
by Sitting Bull, fell to the ground in a trance, and saw his brother.
While talking with him, however, he suddenly awoke, much to his regret,
probably from some one of the dancers having touched against him as he
lay upon the ground. According to his statement, the words were spoken
by him in his sleep after coming from the dance and were overheard by
some companions who questioned him about it in the morning, when he
told his experience and put the words into a song. The “father” here
referred to is Sitting Bull, the great apostle of the Arapaho Ghost
dance. It was from Paul’s statement, intelligently told in good English
before I had yet seen the dance, that I was first led to suspect that
hypnotism was the secret of the trances.

This song was composed by Sitting Bull, the Arapaho apostle of the
dance, and relates his own experience in the trance, in which he met
his father, who had died years before. The expression, “You are the
child of a crow,” may refer to his own sacred character as an apostle,
the crow being regarded as the messenger from the spirit world.

In this song the father tells his children of the desolation, in
consequence of their folly and injustice, that would come upon the
whites when they will be left alone upon the old world, while the

In this song the dreamer tells his friends, on the authority of the
messiah, that the predicted spiritual new earth is about to start to
come over and cover up this old world. It was also taught, as appears
from the messiah’s letter, that at the moment of contact this world
would tremble as in an earthquake.

According to the story of the author, his father is transformed into
a bird even while he looks at him. The song is sung in quick time to
hasten the trance.

This is one of the old songs now obsolete, and its meaning is not
clear. It may mean simply that the author of it climbed a rock in order
to be able to see farther, but it is more likely that it contains some
mythic reference.

[Illustration: +Fig. 93+—Hummer and bull-roarer.]

The author of this song saw her children in the other world playing
with the _hätiku′tha_, or hummer. On going home after awaking from
her trance, she made the toy and carried it with her to the next dance
and twirled it in the air while singing the song. The _hätiku′tha_,
or hummer, is used by the boys of the prairie tribes as our boys use
the “cut-water,” a circular tin disk, suspended on two strings passed
through holes in the middle, and set in rapid revolution, so as to
produce a humming sound, by alternately twisting the strings upon each
other and allowing them to untwist again. One of these which I examined
consists of a bone from a buffalo hoof, painted in different colors,
with four buckskin strings tied around the middle and running out on
each side and fastened at each end to a small peg, so as to be more
firmly grasped by the fingers. It was carried in the dance in 1890
by an old Arapaho named Tall Bear, who had had it in his possession
for twenty years. Another specimen, shown in figure 93, _a_, now in
possession of the National Museum, is similar in construction, but with
only one string on each side.

A kindred toy—it can hardly be considered a musical instrument—is that
known among the whites as the “bull-roarer.” It is found among most of
the western tribes, as well as among our own children and primitive
peoples all over the world. It is usually a simple flat piece of wood,
about 6 inches long, sometimes notched on the edges and fancifully
painted, attached to a sinew or buckskin string of convenient length.
It is held in one hand, and when twirled rapidly in the air produces
a sound not unlike the roaring of a bull or of distant thunder. With
most tribes it is simply a child’s toy, but among the Hopi, according
to Fewkes, and the Apache, according to Bourke, it has a sacred use to
assist the prayers of the medicine-man in bringing on the storm clouds
and the rain.

    (Thus) my father told me—_Ahe′eye′-he′eye′!_

In the mythology of many primitive nations, from the ancient Hindu to
our own Indian tribes, the turtle or tortoise is the supporter of the
earth, the Atlas on whose back rests the burden of the whole living
universe. A reason for this is found in the amphibious character of the
turtle, which renders it equally at home on land and in the water, and
in its peculiar shape, which was held to be typical of the world, the
world itself being conceived as a huge turtle swimming in a limitless
ocean, the dome of the sky being its upper shell, and the flat surface
of the earth being the bony breastplate of the animal, while inclosed
between them was the living body, the human, animal, and vegetal
creation. In Hindu mythology, when the gods are ready to destroy
mankind, the turtle will grow weary and sink under his load and then
the waters will rise and a deluge will overwhelm the earth. (_Fiske._)

The belief in the turtle as the upholder of the earth was common to
all the Algonquian tribes, to which belong the Arapaho and Cheyenne,
and to the northern Iroquoian tribes. Earthquakes were caused by his
shifting his position from time to time. In their pictographs the
turtle was frequently the symbol of the earth, and in their prayers it
was sometimes addressed as mother. The most honored clan was the Turtle
clan; the most sacred spot in the Algonquian territory was Mackinaw,
the “Island of the Great Turtle;” the favorite medicine bowl of their
doctors is the shell of a turtle; the turtle is pictured on the
ghost shirts of the Arapaho, and farther south in Oklahoma it is the
recognized stock brand by which it is known that a horse or cow belongs
to one of the historic Delaware tribe.

This song evidently refers to the Thunderbird. It is one of the old
favorites from the north, and is sung to a sprightly tune in quick
time. It differs from the others in having only a part instead of all
of the line repeated.

This is the most pathetic of the Ghost-dance songs. It is sung to a
plaintive tune, sometimes with tears rolling down the cheeks of the
dancers as the words would bring up thoughts of their present miserable
and dependent condition. It may be considered the Indian paraphrase of
the Lord’s prayer.

    On high—_He′e′e′!_

The meaning of this song is not clear. It may refer to the Thunderbird
or to the Crow, the sacred bird of the Ghost dance. The _ye′nis_ or
wild rose is much esteemed among the prairie tribes for its red seed
berries, which are pounded into a paste and dried for food. It is
frequently mentioned in the ghost songs, and is sometimes pictured
on the ghost shirts. Although rather insipid, the berries possess
nutritive qualities. They are gathered in winter, and are sometimes
eaten raw, but more generally are first boiled and strained to get rid
of the seeds. This dough-like substance is sometimes mixed with marrow
from broken bones and pasted around sticks and thus roasted before the
fire. It is never packed away for future use. The Cherokee call the
same plant by a name which means “rabbit food,” on account of this
animal’s fondness for the berries.

    _He′yoho′ho′! He′yoho′ho′!_

This is another song about the whites, who are spoken of as “yellow
hides” or “white skins.” The proper Arapaho name for a white man is
_Nia′tha_, “skillful.” A great many names are applied to the whites by
the different Indian tribes. By the Comanche, Shoshoni, and Paiute they
are called _Tai′vo_, “easterners;” by the Hopi, of the same stock as
the three tribes mentioned, they are known as _Paha′na_, “eastern water
people;” by the Kiowa they are called _Be′dălpago_, “hairy mouths,” or
_Ta‛ka′-i_, “standing ears.” It is very doubtful if the “pale face” of
romance ever existed in the Indian mind.

The Kiowa, the Sioux, and perhaps some other tribes performed the Ghost
dance around a tree set up in the center of the circle. With the Kiowa
this tree was a cedar, and such was probably the case with the other
tribes, whenever a cedar could be obtained, as it is always a sacred
tree in Indian belief and ceremonial. The southern Arapaho and Cheyenne
never had a tree in connection with the Ghost dance, so that this song
could not have originated among them. The cedar is held sacred for its
evergreen foliage, its fragrant smell, its red heart wood, and the
durable character of its timber. On account of its fine grain, and
enduring qualities the prairie tribes make their tipi poles of its
wood, which will not warp through heat or moisture. Their flageolets or
flutes are also made of cedar, and in the mescal and other ceremonies
its dried and crumbled foliage is thrown upon the fire as incense. In
Cherokee and Yuchi myth the red color of the wood comes from the blood
of a wizard who was killed and decapitated by a hero, and whose head
was hung in the top of several trees in succession, but continued to
live until, by the advice of a medicine-man, the people hung it in the
topmost branches of a cedar tree, where it finally died. The blood of
the severed head trickled down the trunk of the tree and thus the wood
was stained.

While singing this song the author of it waved in his right hand an
eagle feather prepared for wearing in the hair, while he carried a
spotted hawk feather in the other hand. In his trance vision he had
received such a spotted feather from the messiah.

From the buffalo they had food, fuel, dress, shelter, and domestic
furniture, shields for defense, points for their arrows, and strings
for their bows. As the old Spanish chronicles of Coronado put it: “To
be short, they make so many things of them as they have need of, or as
many as suffice them in the use of this life.”

Among Indians the professions of medicine and religion are inseparable.
The doctor is always a priest, and the priest is always a doctor.
Hence, to the whites in the Indian country the Indian priest-doctor
has come to be known as the “medicine-man,” and anything sacred,
mysterious, or of wonderful power or efficacy in Indian life or belief
is designated as “medicine,” this term being the nearest equivalent of
the aboriginal expression in the various languages. To “make medicine”
is to perform some sacred ceremony, from the curing of a sick child
to the consecration of the sun-dance lodge. Among the prairie tribes
the great annual tribal ceremony was commonly known as the “medicine
dance,” and the special guardian deity of every warrior was spoken of
as his “medicine.”

The buffalo was to the nomad hunters of the plains what corn was to the
more sedentary tribes of the east and south—the living, visible symbol
of their support and existence; the greatest gift of a higher being to
his children. Something of the buffalo entered into every important
ceremony. In the medicine dance—or sun dance, as it is frequently
called—the head and skin of a buffalo hung from the center pole of the
lodge, and in the fearful torture that accompanied this dance among
some tribes, the dancers dragged around the circle buffalo skulls
tied to ropes which were fastened to skewers driven through holes cut
in their bodies and limbs. A buffalo skull is placed in front of the
sacred sweat-lodge, and on the battlefield of Wounded Knee I have seen
buffalo skulls and plates of dried meat placed at the head of the
graves. The buffalo was the sign of the Creator on earth as the sun
was his glorious manifestation in the heavens. The hair of the buffalo
was an important element in the preparation of “medicine,” whether for
war, hunting, love, or medicine proper, and for such purpose the
Indian generally selected a tuft taken from the breast close under the
shoulder of the animal. When the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache delegates
visited Washington in the spring of 1894, they made an earnest and
successful request for some buffalo hair from the animals in the
Zoological Park, together with some branches from the cedars in the
grounds of the Agricultural Department, to take home with them for use
in their sacred ceremonies.

This song refers to the sweat-lodge already described in treating of
the Ghost dance among the Sioux. In preparing the sweat-lodge a small
hole, perhaps a foot deep, is dug out in the center of the floor space,
to serve as a receptacle for the heated stones over which the water
is poured to produce the steam. The earth thus dug out is piled in a
small hillock a few feet in front of the entrance to the sweat-lodge,
which always faces the east. This small mound is called _thi′äya_ in
the Arapaho language, the same name being also applied to a memorial
stone heap or to a stone monument. It is always surmounted by a buffalo
skull, or in these days by the skull of a steer, placed so as to face
the doorway of the lodge. The _thi′äya_ is mentioned in several of the
Ghost-dance songs, and usually, as here, in connection with crying or
lamentation, as though the sight of these things in the trance vision
brings up sad recollections.

    Then he collected them (i. e., on the farther side).

The crow (_ho_) is the sacred bird of the Ghost dance, being revered
as the messenger from the spirit world because its color is symbolic
of death and the shadow land. The raven, which is practically a larger
crow, and which lives in the mountains, but occasionally comes down
into the plains, is also held sacred and regarded as a bringer of omens
by the prairie tribes, as well as by the Tlinkit and others of the
northwest coast and by the Cherokee in the east. The crow is depicted
on the shirts, leggings, and moccasins of the Ghost dancers, and its
feathers are worn on their heads, and whenever it is possible to kill
one, the skin is stuffed as in life and carried in the dance, as shown
in the picture of Black Coyote (plate +CV+). At one time the dancers
in Left Hand’s camp had a crow which it was claimed had the power of
speech and prophetic utterance, and its hoarse inarticulate cries were
interpreted as inspired messages from the spirit world. Unfortunately
the bird did not thrive in confinement, and soon took its departure
for the land of spirits, leaving the Arapaho once more dependent on
the guidance of the trance revelations. The eagle, the magpie, and
the sage-hen are also sacred in the Ghost dance, the first being held
in veneration by Indians, as well as by other peoples throughout
the world, while the magpie and the sage-hen are revered for their
connection with the country of the messiah and the mythology of his
tribe.

The crow was probably held sacred by all the tribes of the Algonquian
race. Roger Williams, speaking of the New England tribes, says that
although the crows sometimes did damage to the corn, yet hardly one
Indian in a hundred would kill one, because it was their tradition that
this bird had brought them their first grain and vegetables, carrying
a grain of corn in one ear and a bean in the other, from the field of
their great god Cautantouwit in Sowwani′u, the southwest, the happy
spirit world where dwelt the gods and the souls of the great and good.
The souls of the wicked were not permitted to enter this elysium after
death, but were doomed to wander without rest or home. (_Williams, Key
into the Language of America, 1643._)

In Arapaho belief, the spirit world is in the west, not on the same
level with this earth of ours, but higher up, and separated also from
it by a body of water. In their statement of the Ghost-dance mythology
referred to in this song, the crow, as the messenger and leader of
the spirits who had gone before, collected their armies on the other
side and advanced at their head to the hither limit of the shadow
land. Then, looking over, they saw far below them a sea, and far out
beyond it toward the east was the boundary of the earth, where lived
the friends they were marching to rejoin. Taking up a pebble in his
beak, the crow then dropped it into the water and it became a mountain
towering up to the land of the dead. Down its rocky slope he brought
his army until they halted at the edge of the water. Then, taking some
dust in his bill, the crow flew out and dropped it into the water as
he flew, and it became a solid arm of land stretching from the spirit
world to the earth. He returned and flew out again, this time with some
blades of grass, which he dropped upon the land thus made, and at once
it was covered with a green sod. Again he returned, and again flew out,
this time with some twigs in his bill, and dropping these also upon
the new land, at once it was covered with a forest of trees. Again
he flew back to the base of the mountain, and is now, for the fourth
time, coming on at the head of all the countless spirit host which has
already passed over the sea and is marshaling on the western boundary
of the earth.

The reference in this song is explained under number 36. The song is
somewhat like the former closing song, number 52.

The author of this song, in his trance vision, saw circling above his
head a crow, the messenger from the spirit world, to conduct him to
his friends who had gone before. The song is a favorite one, and is
sung with a quick forcible tune when the excitement begins to grow
more intense, in order to hasten the trances, the idea conveyed to the
dancers being that their spirit friends are close at hand.

In this song the father speaks to his children and gives them the new

    There is the sheath lying there,

This song was composed by Nakash, or “Sage,” one of the northern
Arapaho delegates to the messiah. It evidently refers to one of
his trance experiences in the other world, and has to do with an
interesting feature in the sociology of the Arapaho and other prairie
tribes. The _ga′ahinĕ′na_ or _gaahi′na_, “coyote men,” were an order of
men of middle age who acted as pickets or lookouts for the camp. When
the band encamped in some convenient situation for hunting or other
business, it was the duty of these men, usually four or six in a band,
to take their stations on the nearest hills to keep watch and give
timely warning in case of the approach of an enemy. It was an office of
danger and responsibility, but was held in corresponding respect. When
on duty, the _gaahi′nĕn_ wore a white buffalo robe and had his face
painted with white clay and carried in his hand the _ya′haga′ahi′na_
or “coyote gun,” a club decorated with feathers and other ornaments
and usually covered with a sheath of bear gut (_i′tha′q_). He must
be unmarried and remain so while in office, finally choosing his
own successor and delivering to him the “coyote gun” as a staff of
authority. They were never all off duty at the same time, but at least
half were always on guard, one or more coming down at a time to the
village to eat or sleep. They built no shelter on the hills, but slept
there in their buffalo robes, or sometimes came down in turn and slept
in their own tipis. They usually, however, preferred to sleep alone
upon the hills in order to receive inspiration in dreams. If attacked
or surprised by the enemy, they were expected to fight. The watcher
was sometimes called _higa′ahi′na-ĭt_, “the man with the coyote gun.”
The corresponding officer among the Cheyenne carried a bow and arrows
instead of a club.

In his trance vision the author of this song saw the spirit hosts
descending from the upper shadow land to the earth, along the mountain
raised up by the crow, as already described in song number 36. The song
comes from the northern Arapaho.


               43. +Nänisa′tăqu′thi Chĭnachi′chibä′iha′+

    They all wear it on their heads—
    The Thunderbird,
    The Thunderbird.
    Then I wept,
    Then I wept.

In his trance vision the author of this song saw a large camp of
Arapaho, and in the midst of the camp circle, as in the old days, were
sitting the seven priests of the _Chĭ′nachichi′bät_, each wearing on
his head the Thunderbird headdress, already described and figured under
song number 14. This vision of the old life of the tribe brought up
sorrowful memories and caused him to weep. In the similar song next
given the singer laments for the _Chĭ′nachichi′bät_ and the _bä′qati_
gaming wheel. The priests here referred to were seven in number, and
constituted the highest order of the military and social organization
which existed among the Blackfeet, Sioux, Cheyenne, Kiowa, and probably
all the prairie tribes excepting the Comanche in the south, among whom
it seems to have been unknown. The society, so far as it has come
under the notice of white men, has commonly been designated by them
as the “Dog Soldier” society—a misapprehension of a name belonging
probably to only one of the six or eight orders of the organization.
The corresponding Blackfoot organization, the _Ikunuhkatsi_ or “All
Comrades,” is described by Grinnell in his “Blackfoot Lodge Tales.” The
Kiowa organization will be noted later.

Among the Arapaho the organization was called _Bĕni′nĕna_, “Warriors,”
and consisted of eight degrees or orders, including nearly all the
men of the tribe above the age of about seventeen. Those who were
not enrolled in some one of the eight orders were held in but little
respect, and were not allowed to take part in public ceremonies or to
accompany war expeditions. Each of the first six orders had its own
peculiar dance, and the members of the principal warrior orders had
also their peculiar staff or badge of rank.

First and lowest in rank were the _Nuhinĕ′na_ or Fox men, consisting of
young men up to the age of about 25 years. They had no special duties
or privileges, but had a dance called the _Nuha′wŭ_ or fox dance.

Next came the _Hă′thahu′ha_ or Star men, consisting of young warriors
about 30 years of age. Their dance was called the _Ha′thahŭ_.

[Illustration: +Fig. 94+—Dog-soldier insignia—rattle and quirt.]

The third order was that of the _Hichăä′quthi_ or Club men. Their dance
was called _Hichăä′qawŭ_. They were an important part of the warrior
organization, and were all men in the prime of life. The four leaders
carried wooden clubs, bearing a general resemblance in shape to a gun,
notched along the edges and variously ornamented. In an attack on the
enemy it was the duty of these leaders to dash on ahead and strike the
enemy with these clubs, then to ride back again and take their places
in the front of the charge. It hardly need be said that the position
of leader of the _Hichăä′quthi_ was a dangerous honor, but the honor
was in proportion to the very danger, and there were always candidates
for a vacancy. It was one of those offices where the holder sometimes
died but never resigned. The other members of the order carried sticks
carved at one end in the rude semblance of a horse head and pointed at
the other. In desperate encounters they were expected to plant these
sticks in the ground in line in front of the body of warriors and to
fight beside them to the death unless a retreat should be ordered by
the chief in command.

The fourth order was called _Bitahi′nĕna_ or Spear men, and their dance
was called _Bitaha′wŭ_. This order came originally from the Cheyenne.
Their duties and peculiar insignia of office were about the same among
all the tribes. They performed police duty in camp, when traveling,
and on the hunt, and were expected to see that the orders of the chief
were obeyed by the tribe. For instance, if any person violated the
tribal code or failed to attend a general dance or council, a party
of _Bitahi′nĕna_ was sent to kill his dogs, destroy his tipi, or in
extreme cases to shoot his ponies. On hunting expeditions it was their
business to keep the party together and see that no one killed a
buffalo until the proper ceremonies had been performed and the order
was given by the chief. They were regarded as the representatives of
the law and were never resisted in performing their duty or inflicting
punishments. In war they were desperate warriors, equaling or
surpassing even the _Hichăä′quthi_. Of the leaders of the order, two
carried a sort of shepherd’s crook called _nu′sa-icha′tha_, having a
lance point at its lower end; two others carried lances wrapped around
with otter skin; four carried lances painted black; one carried a
club shaped like a baseball bat, and one carried a rattle made of the
scrotum of a buffalo and ornamented with its hair. In battle, if the
enemy took shelter behind defenses, it was this man’s duty to lead the
charge, throw his rattle among the enemy, and then follow it himself.

The fifth order was called _Aha′känĕ′na_ or Crazy men. They were men
more than 50 years of age, and were not expected to go to war, but must
have graduated from all the lower orders. Their duties were religious
and ceremonial, and their insignia consisted of a bow and a bundle of
blunt arrows. Their dance was the _Ahaka′wŭ_ or crazy dance, which well
deserved the name. It will be described in another place.

The sixth was the order of the _Hĕthĕ′hinĕ′na_ or Dog men. Their
dance was called _Hĕthĕwa′wû′_. They had four principal leaders and
two lesser leaders. The four principal leaders were the generals and
directors of the battle. Each carried a rattle and wore about his neck
a buckskin strap (two being yellow, the other two black) which hung
down to his feet. On approaching the enemy, they were obliged to go
forward, shaking their rattles and chanting the war song, until some
other warriors of the party took the rattles out of their hands. When
forming for the attack, they dismounted, and, driving their lances
into the ground, tied themselves to them by means of the straps,
thus anchoring themselves in front of the battle. Here they remained
until, if the battle seemed lost, they themselves gave the order
to retreat. Even then they waited until some of their own society
released them by pulling the lances out of the ground and whipping
them away from the place with a peculiar quirt carried only by the
private members of this division. No one was allowed to retreat without
their permission, on penalty of disgrace, nor were they themselves
allowed to retire until thus released. Should their followers forget
to release them in the confusion of retreat, they were expected to die
at their posts. They could not be released excepting by one of their
own division, and anyone else attempting to pull up the lances from
the ground was resisted as an enemy. When pursued on the retreat, they
must give up their horses to the women, if necessary, and either find
other horses or turn and face the enemy alone on foot. They seldom
accompanied any but large war parties, and, although they did but
little actual fighting, their very presence inspired the warriors with
desperate courage, and the driving of their lances into the ground was
always understood as the signal for an encounter to the death.

  DOG-SOLDIER INSIGNIA—LANCE AND SASH]

The seventh order was that of the _Nûnaha′wŭ_, a word of which the
meaning is now unknown. This was a secret order. They had no dance and
their ceremonies were witnessed only by themselves. They did not fight,
but accompanied the war parties, and every night in secret performed
ceremonies and prayers for their success.

The eighth and highest order was that of the _Chĭ′nachinĕ′na_ or
Water-pouring men, the “seven venerable priests” to whom the song
refers. They were the high priests and instructors of all the other
orders, and were seven in number, from among the oldest warriors of the
tribe. Their name refers to their pouring the water over the heated
stones in the sweat-house to produce steam. They had no dance, and
were not expected to go to war, although one of the seven was allowed
to accompany the war party, should he so elect. Their ceremonies were
performed in a large sweat-lodge, called _chĭnachichi′bät_, which,
when the whole tribe was camped together, occupied the center of the
circle, between the entrance and the lodge in which was kept the sacred
medicine pipe. Unlike the ordinary sweat-lodge, this one had no mound
and buffalo skull in front of the entrance.

The warrior organization of the Kiowa is called _Yä′pähe_, “Soldiers,”
and consisted of six orders, each with its own dance, songs, and
ceremonial dress. 1. _Poläñyup_ or _Tsäñ′yui_, “Rabbits.” These
were boys and young men from 8 to 15 years of age. Their dance, in
which they were drilled by certain old men, has a peculiar step, in
imitation of the jumping movement of a rabbit; 2. _Ädalto′yui_, or
_Te′ñbiyu′i_, “Young Mountain Sheep,” literally “Herders or Corralers;”
3. _Tseñtä′nmo_, “Horse Head-dress (?) people;” 4. _Toñkoñ′ko_,
(?) “Black-leg people;” 5. _T‘äñpe′ko_, “Skunkberry (?) people;”
6. _Kâ′itseñ′ko_, “Principal Dogs or Real Dogs.” These last were
the highest warrior order, and also the camp police, combining the
functions of the _Bitahi′nĕna_ and the _Hĕthĕ′binĕ′na_ of the Arapaho
organization. Their two leaders carried an arrow-shape lance, with
which they anchored themselves in the front of the battle by means of
buckskin straps brought over the shoulders. The _Toñkoñ′ko_ captains
carried in a similar way a crook-shape lance, called _pabo′n_, similar
to that of the _Bitahi′nĕna_ of the Arapaho.

This song refers to the pemmican or preparation of dried and pounded
meat, which formerly formed a favorite food of the prairie tribes, and
which the author of the song evidently tasted as it was being prepared
by the women in the spirit world. (See Sioux song 7.) One must be an
Indian to know the thrill of joy that would come to the heart of the
dancers when told that some dreamer had seen their former friends in
the spirit world still making and feasting on pemmican. During the
first year or two of the excitement, it several times occurred at Ghost
dances in the north and south, among Sioux as well as among Arapaho and
others, that meat was exhibited and tasted as genuine buffalo beef or
pemmican brought back from the spirit world by one of the dancers. It
is not necessary to explain how this deception was accomplished or made
successful. It is sufficient to know that it was done, and that the
dancers were then in a condition to believe anything.

    I know, in the pitfall—
    I know, in the pitfall—
    It is tallow they use in the pitfall,
    It is tallow they use in the pitfall.

This song refers to the vision of a northern Arapaho, who found one
of his friends in the spirit world preparing a pitfall trap to catch
eagles. Wherever found, the eagle was regarded as sacred among the
Indian tribes both east and west, and its feathers were highly prized
for ornamental and “medicine” purposes, and an elaborately detailed
ritual of prayer and ceremony was the necessary accompaniment to its
capture. Among all the tribes the chief purpose of this ritual was
to obtain the help of the gods in inducing the eagle to approach
the hunter, and to turn aside the anger of the eagle spirits at the
necessary sacrilege. The feathers most valued were those of the tail
and wings. These were used to ornament lances and shields, to wear upon
the head, and to decorate the magnificent war bonnets, the finest of
which have a pendant or trail of eagle-tail feathers reaching from the
warrior’s head to the ground when he stands erect. The whistle used
in the sun dance and other great ceremonies is made of a bone from
the leg or wing of the eagle, and the fans carried by the warriors on
parade and used also to sprinkle the holy water in the mescal ceremony
of the southern prairie tribes is commonly made of the entire tail or
wing of that bird. Hawk feathers are sometimes used for these various
purposes, but are always considered far inferior to those of the eagle.
The smaller feathers are used upon arrows. Eagle feathers and ponies
were formerly the standard of value and the medium of exchange among
the prairie tribes, as wampum was with those of the Atlantic coast.
The standard varied according to place and season, but in a general
way from two to four eagles were rated as equal to a horse. In these
days the eagle-feather war bonnets and eagle-tail fans are the most
valuable parts of an Indian’s outfit and the most difficult to purchase
from him. Among the pueblo tribes eagles are sometimes taken from the
nest when young and kept in cages and regularly stripped of their best
feathers. Among the Caddo, Cherokee, and other tribes of the timbered
country in the east they were shot with bow and arrow or with the gun,
but always according to certain ritual ceremonies. Among the prairie
tribes along the whole extent of the plains they were never shot, but
must be captured alive in pitfalls and then strangled or crushed to
death, if possible without the shedding of blood. A description of
the Arapaho method will answer with slight modifications for all the
prairie tribes.

The hunter withdrew with his family away from the main camp to some
rough hilly country where the eagles were abundant. After some
preliminary prayers he went alone to the top of the highest hill and
there dug a pit large enough to sit or lie down in, being careful to
carry the earth taken out of the hole so far away from the place that
it would not attract the notice of the eagle. The pit was roofed over
with a covering of light willow twigs, above which were placed earth
and grass to give it a natural appearance. The bait was a piece of
fresh meat, or, as appears from this song, a piece of tallow stripped
from the ribs of the buffalo. This was tied to a rawhide string and
laid upon the top of the pit, while the rope was passed down through
the roof into the cavity below. A coyote skin, stuffed and set up erect
as in life, was sometimes placed near the bait to add to the realistic
effect. Having sat up all night, singing the eagle songs and purifying
himself for the ceremony, the hunter started before daylight, without
eating any breakfast or drinking water, and went up the hill to the
pit, which he entered, and, having again closed the opening, he seated
himself inside holding the end of the string in his hands, to prevent a
coyote or other animal from taking the bait, and waiting for the eagles
to come.

Should other birds come, he drove them away or paid no attention to
them. When at last the eagle came the other birds at once flew away.
The eagle swooped down, alighting always at one side and then walking
over upon the roof of the trap to get at the bait, when the hunter,
putting up his hand through the framework, seized the eagle by the
legs, pulled it down and quickly strangled it or broke its neck. He
then rearranged the bait and the roof and sat down to wait for another
eagle. He might be so lucky as to capture several during the day, or
so unfortunate as to take none at all. At night, but not before, he
repaired to his own tipi to eat, drink, and sleep, and was at the pit
again before daylight. While in the pit he did not eat, drink, or
sleep. The eagle hunt, if it may be so called, lasted four days, and
must end then, whatever might have been the good or bad fortune of the
hunter.

At the expiration of four days he returned to his home with the dead
bodies of the eagles thus caught. A small lodge was set up outside his
tipi and in this the eagles were hung up by the neck upon a pole laid
across two forked sticks driven into the ground. After some further
prayers and purifications the feathers were stripped from the bodies as
they hung.

The Blackfoot method, as described by Grinnell, in his Blackfoot Lodge
Tales, was the same in all essentials as that of the Arapaho. He adds
several details, which were probably common to both tribes and to
others, but which my Arapaho informants failed to mention. While the
hunter was away in the pit his wife or daughters at home must not use
an awl for sewing or for other purposes, as, should they do so, the
eagle might scratch the hunter. He took a human skull with him into the
pit, in order that he might be as invisible to the eagle as the spirit
of the former owner of the skull. He must not eat the berries of the
wild rose during this period, or the eagle would not attack the bait,
and he must put a morsel of pemmican into the mouth of the dead eagle
in order to gain the good will of its fellows and induce them to come
in and be caught.

The eagle-catching ceremony of the Caddo, Cherokee, and other eastern
tribes will be noticed in treating of the Caddo songs.

    With the _bä′qati_ wheel I am gambling,
    With the _bä′qati_ wheel I am gambling.
    With the black mark I win the game,
    With the black mark I win the game.

This song is from the northern Arapaho. The author of it, in his visit
to the spirit world, found his former friends playing the old game of
the _bä′qati_ wheel, which was practically obsolete among the prairie
tribes, but which is being revived since the advent of the Ghost dance.
As it was a favorite game with the men in the olden times, a great many
of the songs founded on these trance visions refer to it, and the wheel
and sticks are made by the dreamer and carried in the dance as they
sing.

The game is played with a wheel (_bä′qati_, “large wheel”) and two
pairs of throwing sticks (_qa′qa-u′nûtha_). The Cheyenne call the wheel
_ä′ko′yo_ or _äkwi′u_, and the sticks _hoo′isi′yonots_. It is a man’s
game, and there are three players, one rolling the wheel, while the
other two, each armed with a pair of throwing sticks, run after it and
throw the sticks so as to cross the wheel in a certain position. The
two throwers are the contestants, the one who rolls the wheel being
merely an assistant. Like most Indian games, it is a means of gambling,
and high stakes are sometimes wagered on the result. It is common to
the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Sioux, and probably to all the northern prairie
tribes, but is not found among the Kiowa or Comanche in the south.

The wheel is about 18 inches in diameter, and consists of a flexible
young tree branch, stripped of its bark and painted, with the two ends
fastened together with sinew or buckskin string. At equal distances
around the circumference of the wheel are cut four figures, the two
opposite each other constituting a pair, but being distinguished by
different colors, usually blue or black and red, and by lines or
notches on the face. These figures are designated simply by their
colors. Figures of birds, crescents, etc., are sometimes also cut or
painted upon the wheel, but have nothing to do with the game. (See
plate +CXI+.)

The sticks are light rods, about 30 inches long, tied in pairs by a
peculiar arrangement of buckskin strings, and distinguished from one
another by pieces of cloth of different colors fastened to the strings.
There is also a pile of tally sticks, usually a hundred in number,
about the size of lead pencils and painted green, for keeping count
of the game. The sticks are held near the center in a peculiar manner
between the fingers of the closed hand. When the wheel is rolled, each
player runs from the same side, and endeavors to throw the sticks so
as to strike the wheel in such a way that when it falls both sticks of
his pair shall be either over or under a certain figure. It requires
dexterity to do this, as the string has a tendency to strike the wheel
in such a way as to make one stick fall under and the other over, in
which case the throw counts for nothing. The players assign their own
value to each figure, the usual value being five points for one and ten
for the other figure, with double that number for a throw which crosses
the two corresponding figures, and one hundred tallies to the game.

The wheel-and-stick game, in some form or another, was almost universal
among our Indian tribes. Another game among the prairie tribes is
played with a netted wheel and a single stick or arrow, the effort
being to send the arrow through the netting as nearly as possible
to the center or bull’s-eye. This game is called _ana′wati′n-hati_,
“playing wheel,” by the Arapaho.

In this song the dancer tells how he watched a group of his friends
in the spirit world playing the game of the _bä′qati_, as has been
explained in the song last treated.

This song refers to a trance vision in which the dreamer found his
people camped by a good, i. e., perennial, river, fringed with abundant
bushes or small trees of the _baa-ni′bin_ or “thunder-berry,” which
appears to be the black haw, being described as a sort of wild cherry,
in size between the chokecherry and the wild plum. It was eaten raw,
or dried and boiled, the seeds having first been taken out. It is very
scarce, if found at all, in the southern plains.

    When the crow makes me dance,

    He tells me (when) to stop.

This was formerly the closing song of the dance, but is now superseded
as such by number 73, beginning _Ahu′yu häthi′na_. It was also the
last song sung when a small party gathered in the tipi at night for a
private rehearsal, and was therefore always held in reserve until the
singers were about ready to separate. The tune is one of the best.
The special office of the crow as the messenger from the spirit world
and representative of the messiah has been already explained. He is
supposed to direct the dance and to give the signal for its close.

The meaning of this song is somewhat obscure. It seems to be a message
from the messiah to the effect that he paints himself with yellow
paint, because it pleases him, the inference being that it would please
him to have his children do the same. Those who take part in the sun
dance are usually painted yellow, that being the color of the sun. This
song is peculiar in having at the end two sharp yelps, in the style of
the ordinary songs of the warrior dances.

In this song the messiah, addressing his children, is represented as a
bird (crow?) flying about the whole earth, symbolic of his omniscience.
The song has one or two variants.

This song was composed by Little Raven, one of the delegation of seven
from the southern Arapaho and Cheyenne which visited the messiah in
Nevada in August, 1891. It is a message to the believers to be ready
for the near coming of the new earth. The first line is sometimes sung
_I′nita′ta-u′sä-hu′na_.


                           56. +Wa′wäthä′bi+

    My children, my children,
    I have given you magpie feathers again to wear on your heads—_He′e′ye′!_
    Thus says our mother,
    Thus says our mother.

This song affords a good specimen of the possibilities of Indian word
building. The second word might serve as a companion piece to Mark
Twain’s picture of a complete word in German. It consists of seventeen
syllables, all so interwoven to complete the sense of the word sentence
that no part can be separated from the rest without destroying the
whole. The verbal part proper indicates that “I have given you (plural)
a headdress again.” The final syllables, _wa-u′i-naga′thi_, show that
the headdress consists of the tail feathers (_wagathi_) of the magpie
(_wa-u-i_). The syllable _cha_ implies repetition or return of action,
this being probably not the first time that the messiah had given
magpie feathers to his visitors.

The magpie (_Pica hudsonica_ or _mittalii_) of the Rocky mountains
and Sierra Nevada and the intermediate region of Nevada and Utah is
perhaps the most conspicuous bird in the Paiute country. It bears a
general resemblance to a crow or blackbird, being about the size of
the latter, and jet black, with the exception of the breast, which
is white, and a white spot on each wing. In its tail are two long
feathers with beautiful changeable metallic luster. It is a home bird,
frequenting the neighborhood of the Paiute camps in small flocks. It
is held sacred among the Paiute, by whom the long tail feathers are
as highly prized for decorative purposes as eagle feathers are among
the tribes of the plains. The standard price for such feathers in 1891
was 25 cents a pair. The delegates who crossed the mountains to visit
the messiah brought back with them quantities of these feathers, which
thenceforth filled an important place in the ceremonial of the Ghost
dance. In fact they were so eagerly sought after that the traders
undertook to meet the demand, at first by importing genuine magpie
feathers from the mountains, but later by fraudulently substituting
selected crow feathers from the east at the same price.

The song is also peculiar in referring to the messiah as “my mother”
(_nena_) instead of “our father” (_hesûnanin_), as usual.

    Our father is about to make me fly around.

This song refers to the present impoverished condition of the Indians,
and to their hope that he is now about to take pity on them and remove
them from this dying world to the new earth above; the feathers worn
on their heads in the dance being expected to act as wings, as already
explained, to enable them to fly to the upper regions.

    They are flying about the carrion—_Hi′ă hi′ni′ni′!_

In this song the dreamer tells of his trance visit to the spirit world,
where he found his friends busily engaged cutting up the meat after
a successful buffalo hunt, while the crows were hovering about the
carrion. Four and seven are the constant sacred numbers of the Ghost
dance, as of Indian ritual and story generally.

    Because our father has so commanded us.

The literal meaning of the last line is “because our father has given
it to us,” the prairie idiom for directing or commanding being to “give
a road” or to “make a road” for the one thus commanded. To disobey is
to “break the road” and to depart from the former custom is to “make a
new road.” The idea is expressed in the same way both in the various
spoken languages and in the sign language.

The author of this song was a woman who in her trance vision saw her
girl friends in the other world playing the ball game, as described in
song number 7. In this case, however, her partner is urged to _throw_
the ball, instead of to strike it.

    I stood upon the earth—_He′e′ye′!_

The author of this song tells how in his trance he went up to the other
world, where he stood upon the new earth and saw the messiah, who took
him around to five different places and gave him a pipe. The number
five may here have some deeper mythic meaning besides that indicated in
the bare narrative.

The maker of this song saw in his vision a sweat-house with a white
shell lying upon the mound in front, where a buffalo skull is usually
placed. The song evidently refers to some interesting religious
ceremony, but was heard only once, and from a young man who could
give no fuller explanation. I have never seen a shell used in this
connection. It may be, as suggested by Reverend H. R. Voth, that the
word shell is really a figurative expression for skull. In the old
days the whole buffalo head was used, instead of the mere skull.

    Let us play the dice game,
    Let us play the dice game.

The woman who composed this song tells how, on waking up in the spirit
world, she met there a party of her former girl companions and sat down
with them to play the two games universally popular with the women of
all the prairie tribes.

[Illustration: +Fig. 95+—Diagram of awl game.]

The first is called _nĕ′bäku′thana_ by the Arapaho and _tsoñä_ or
“awl game” (from _tsoñ_, an awl) by the Kiowa, on account of an awl,
the Indian woman’s substitute for a needle, being used to keep record
of the score. The game is becoming obsolete in the north, but is the
everyday summer amusement of the women among the Kiowa, Comanche, and
Apache in the southern plains. It is very amusing on account of the
unforeseen “rivers” and “whips” that are constantly turning up to
disappoint the expectant winner, and a party of women will frequently
sit around the blanket for half a day at a time, with a constant ripple
of laughter and good-humored jokes as they follow the chances of the
play. It would make a very pretty picnic game, or could readily be
adapted to the parlor of civilization.

The players sit upon the ground around a blanket marked in charcoal
with lines and dots, and quadrants in the corners, as shown in figure
95. In the center is a stone upon which the sticks are thrown. Each
dot, excepting those between the parallels, counts a point, making
twenty-four points for dots. Each of the parallel lines, and each
end of the curved lines in the corners, also counts a point, making
sixteen points for the lines or forty points in all. The players start
from the bottom, opposing players moving in opposite directions, and
with each throw of the sticks the thrower moves her awl forward and
sticks it into the blanket at the dot or line to which her throw
carries her. The parallels on each of the four sides are called
“rivers,” and the dots within these parallels do not count in the
game. The rivers at the top and bottom are “dangerous” and can not be
crossed, and when the player is so unlucky as to score a throw which
brings her upon the edge of the river (i. e., upon the first line of
either of these pairs of parallels), she “falls into the river” and
must lose all she has hitherto gained, and begin again at the start.
In the same way, when a player moving around in one direction makes
a throw which brings her awl to the place occupied by the awl of her
opponent coming around from the other side, the said opponent is
“whipped back” to the starting point and must begin all over again.
Thus there is a constant succession of unforeseen accidents which
furnish endless amusement to the players.

[Illustration: +Fig. 96+—Sticks used in awl game.]

[Illustration: +Fig. 97+—Trump sticks used in awl game.]

The game is played with four sticks, each from 6 to 10 inches long,
flat on one side and round on the other (figure 96). One of these is
the trump stick and is marked in a distinctive manner in the center on
both sides, and is also distinguished by having a green line along the
flat side (figure 97), while the others have each a red line. The Kiowa
call this trump stick _sahe_, “green,” on account of the green stripe,
while the others are called _guadal_, “red.” There are also a number of
small green sticks, about the size of lead pencils, for keeping tally.
Each player in turn takes up the four sticks together in her hand and
throws them down on end upon the stone in the center. The number of
points depends on the number of flat or round sides which turn up. A
lucky throw with the green or trump stick generally gives the thrower
another trial in addition. The formula is:

  One flat side up counts                             1
  One flat side (if _sahe_) counts                    1 and another throw.
  Two flat sides up, with or without _sahe_, count    2
  Three flat sides up count                           3
  Three flat sides up, including _sahe_, count        3 and another throw.
  All four flat sides up count                        6 and another throw.
  All four round sides up count                      10 and another throw.

[Illustration: +Fig. 98+—Baskets used in dice game.]

Only the flat sides count except when all the sticks turn round side
up. This is the best throw of all, as it counts ten points and another
throw. On completing one round of forty points the player takes one
of the small green tally sticks from the pile and she who first gets
the number of tally sticks previously agreed on wins the game. Two,
four, or any even number of persons may play the game, half on each
side. When two or more play on a side, all the partners move up the
same number of points at each throw, but only the lucky thrower gets a
second trial in case of a trump throw.

The other woman’s game mentioned, the dice game, is called
_ta-u′sĕta′tina_ (literally, “striking,” or “throwing against”
something) by the Arapaho, and _mo′nshimûnh_ by the Cheyenne, the same
name being now given to the modern card games. It was practically
universal among all the tribes east and west, and under the name of
“hub-bub” is described by a New England writer as far back as 1634,
almost precisely as it exists today among the prairie tribes. The only
difference seems to have been that in the east it was played also by
the men, and to the accompaniment of a song such as is used in the hand
games of the western tribes.

[Illustration: +Fig. 99+—Dice used in dice game.]

The requisites are a small wicker bowl or basket (_hatĕchi′na_), five
dice made of bone or of plum stones, and a pile of tally sticks such
as are used in the awl game. The bowl is 6 or 8 inches in diameter
and about 2 inches deep, and is woven in basket fashion of the tough
fibers of the yucca (figure 98). The dice may be round, elliptical,
or diamond-shape and are variously marked on one side with lines and
figures, the turtle being a favorite design among the Arapaho (figure
99). Two of the five must be alike in shape and marking. The other
three are marked with another design and may also be of another shape.
Any number of women or girls may play, each throwing in turn, and
sometimes one set of partners playing against another. The players toss
up the dice from the basket, letting them drop again into it, and score
points according to the way the dice turn up in the basket. The first
throw by each player is made from the hand instead of from the basket.
One hundred points usually count a game, and stakes are wagered on the
result as in almost every other Indian contest of skill or chance.
For the purpose of explanation, we shall designate two of the five as
“rounds” and the other three as “diamonds,” it being understood that
only the marked side counts in the game, excepting when the throw
happens to turn up the three diamonds blank while the other two show
the marked side, or, as sometimes happens, when all five dice turn up
blank. In every case all of one kind at least must turn up to score a
point. A successful throw entitles the player to another throw, while a
failure obliges her to pass the basket to some one else. The formula is:

  1 only of either kind                                0
  2 rounds                                             3
  3 diamonds (both rounds with blank side up)          3
  3 diamonds blank (both rounds with marked side up)   3
  4 marked sides up                                    1

A game similar in principle, but played with six dice instead of
five, is also played by the Arapaho women, as well as by those of the
Comanche and probably also of other tribes.

    My children, my children,
    My top, my top—
    It will win the game,
    It will win the game.

The man who made this song when he entered the spirit world in his
vision met there one of his boy friends who had died long years before,
and once more spun tops with him as in childhood.

Tops are used by all Indian boys, and are made of wood or bone. They
are not thrown or spun with a string, but are kept in motion by
whipping with a small quirt or whip of buckskin. In winter they are
spun upon the ice. The younger children make tops to twirl with the
fingers by running a stick through a small seed berry.

    Nithi′na hesûna′nini′—Ahe′e′ye′!

                             _Translation_

    When we dance until daylight our father, the Moon, takes pity on
        us—_Ahe′e′ye′!_
    When we dance until daylight our father, the Moon, takes pity on
        us—_Ahe′e′ye′!_
    The father says so—_Ahe′e′ye′!_
    The father says so—_Ahe′e′ye′!_

With the Arapaho, as with many other tribes, the moon is masculine,
and the sun is feminine. In mythology the two are brother and sister.
There are various myths to account for the spots on the moon’s surface,
some discerning in them a large frog, while to others they bear a
likeness to a kettle hung over the fire. The Arapaho name for the moon,
_bi′gushish_, means literally “night sun,” the sun itself being called
_hishinishish_, “day sun.” A similar nomenclature exists among most
other tribes.

    It is I who wear the morning star on my head;
    I show it to my children,
    I show it to my children,
    Says the father,
    Says the father.

This beautiful song originated among the northern Arapaho, and is
a favorite north and south. In it the messiah is supposed to be
addressing his children. There is a rhythmic swing to the vocalic
syllables that makes the tune particularly pleasing, and the imagery of
thought expressed is poetry itself. The same idea occurs in European
ballad and legend, and has a parallel in the angel of the evangelist,
“clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow upon his head.”


                       68. +A′-nena′ tabi′ni′na+

    My mother gave me my _tĭ′qtawa_ stick.
    I fly around with it,
    I fly around with it,
    To make me see my children,
    To make me see my children.

This song was composed by a woman of the southern Arapaho. The
reference is not entirely clear, but it is probable that in her trance
vision she saw her children in the other world playing the game
mentioned, and that afterward she made the game sticks and carried them
in the dance, hoping by this means to obtain another vision of the
spirit world, where she could again talk with her children who had gone
before her to the shadow land. In one Ghost dance seven different women
carried these game sticks.

The _băti′qtûba_ (abbreviated _ti′qtûp_) game of the Arapaho and other
prairie tribes somewhat resembles the Iroquois game of the “snow
snake,” and is played by children or grown persons of both sexes. It
is a very simple game, the contestants merely throwing or sliding the
sticks along the ground to see who can send them farthest. Two persons
or two parties play against each other, boys sometimes playing against
girls or men against women. It is, however, more especially a girl’s
game. The game sticks (_bătĭqta′wa_) are slender willow rods about 4
feet long, peeled and painted and tipped with a point of buffalo horn
to enable them to slide more easily along the ground. In throwing, the
player holds the stick at the upper end with the thumb and fingers,
and, swinging it like a pendulum, throws it out with a sweeping motion.
Young men throw arrows about in the same way, and small boys sometimes
throw ordinary reeds or weed stalks. Among the Omaha, according to
Dorsey, bows, unstrung, are made to slide along the ground or ice in
the same manner.

    _Yĭ′hä′ä′ä′hi′hĭ′, Yĭ′hä′ä′ä′hi′hĭ′_,
    I throw the “button,”
    I throw the “button.”

In his trance vision the author of this song entered a tipi and found
it filled with a circle of his old friends playing the _ga′qutit_,
or “hunt the button” game. This is a favorite winter game with the
prairie tribes, and was probably more or less general throughout the
country. It is played both by men and women, but never by the two
sexes together. It is the regular game in the long winter nights after
the scattered families have abandoned their exposed summer positions
on the open prairie, and moved down near one another in the shelter
of the timber along the streams. When hundreds of Indians are thus
camped together, the sound of the drum, the rattle, and the gaming song
resound nightly through the air. To the stranger there is a fascination
about such a camp at night, with the conical tipis scattered about
under the trees, the firelight from within shining through the white
canvas and distinctly outlining upon the cloth the figures of the
occupants making merry inside with jest and story, while from half a
dozen different directions comes the measured tap of the Indian drum or
the weird chorus of the gaming songs. Frequently there will be a party
of twenty to thirty men gaming in one tipi, and singing so that their
voices can be heard far out from the camp, while from another tipi a
few rods away comes a shrill chorus from a group of women engaged in
another game of the same kind.

The players sit in a circle around the tipi fire, those on one side of
the fire playing against those on the other. The only requisites are
the “button” or _ga′qaä_, usually a small bit of wood, around which is
tied a piece of string or otter skin, with a pile of tally sticks, as
has been already described. Each party has a “button,” that of one
side being painted black, the other being red. The leader of one party
takes the button and endeavors to move it from one hand to the other,
or to pass it on to a partner, while those of the opposing side keep a
sharp lookout, and try to guess in which hand it is. Those having the
button try to deceive their opponents as to its whereabouts by putting
one hand over the other, by folding their arms, and by putting their
hands behind them, so as to pass the _ga′qaä_, on to a partner, all
the while keeping time to the rhythm of a gaming chorus sung by the
whole party at the top of their voices. The song is very peculiar, and
well-nigh indescribable. It is usually, but not always or entirely,
unmeaning, and jumps, halts, and staggers in a most surprising fashion,
but always in perfect time with the movements of the hands and arms
of the singers. The greatest of good-natured excitement prevails, and
every few minutes some more excitable player claps his hands over
his mouth or beats the ground with his flat palms, and gives out a
regular war-whoop. All this time the opposing players are watching the
hands of the other, or looking straight into their faces to observe
every telltale movement of their features, and when one thinks he has
discovered in which hand the button is, he throws out his thumb toward
that hand with a loud “_that!_” Should he guess aright, his side scores
a certain number of tallies, and in turn takes the button and begins
another song. Should the guess be wrong, the losing side must give up
an equivalent number of tally sticks. So the play goes on until the
small hours of the night. It is always a gambling game, and the stakes
are sometimes very large.

The first line of the song here given is an imitation of one of these
gambling songs. Among the prairie tribes each song has one or perhaps
two words with meaning bearing on the game, the rest of the song
being a succession of unmeaning syllables. Among some other tribes,
particularly among the Navaho, as described by Dr Washington Matthews,
the songs have meaning, being prayers to different animal or elemental
gods to assist the player.

As specimens of another variety of gambling songs, we give here two
heard among the Paiute of Nevada when visiting the messiah in the
winter of 1891–92. They have pretty tunes, very distinct from those of
the prairie tribes, and were borrowed by the Paiute from the Mohave, in
whose language they may have a meaning, although unintelligible to the
Paiute.

This song also refers to the game of _ga′qutit_, just described. The
_ga′qaä_ is the “button.”

This song refers to the same game described under songs 69 and 70, and
like them is based on the trance experience of the composer.

    Father, the Morning Star!
    Father, the Morning Star!
    Look on us, we have danced until daylight,
    Look on us, we have danced until daylight.
    Take pity on us—_Hi′i′i′!_
    Take pity on us—_Hi′i′i′!_

This song is sung about daylight, just before the closing song,
after the dancers have danced all night and are now ready to quit
and go home. When the new doctrine came among the prairie tribes,
the Ghost dance was held at irregular and frequent intervals, almost
every other night, in fact—lasting sometimes until about midnight,
sometimes until daylight, without any rule. As the ceremonial became
crystallized, however, the messiah gave instructions that the dance
should be held only at intervals of six weeks, and should then continue
four consecutive nights, lasting the first three nights until about
midnight, but on the fourth night to continue all night until daylight
of the next morning. The original letter containing these directions is
given in chapter X. For a long time these directions were implicitly
followed, but the tendency now is to the original fashion of one-night
dances, at short intervals. This song to the morning star was sung just
before daylight on the final morning of the dance.

With all the prairie tribes the morning star is held in great reverence
and is the subject of much mythological belief and ceremony. It is
universally represented in their pictographs as a cross, usually of the
Maltese pattern. In this form it is frequently pictured on the ghost
shirts. The Arapaho name, _nagaq′_, means literally “a cross.” The
Kiowa know it as _t’aiñso_, “the cross,” or sometimes, as _dä-e′dal_,
“the great star.”


                 73. +Ahu′yu häthi′na+ (closing song)

    Thus says our father, the Crow.
    Go around five times more—
    Go around five times more—
    Says the father,
    Says the father.

This is the closing song of the dance since the return of the great
delegation of southern Arapaho and Cheyenne who visited the messiah
in August, 1891. Before that time the closing song had been number
52, beginning _Ni′nini′tubi′na hu′hu′_. The literal rendering of the
second part is “stop five times,” the meaning and practice being that
they must make five circuits singing this song and then stop. As
already stated, in accordance with the instructions of the messiah,
the Ghost dance is now held (theoretically) at intervals of six weeks
and continues for four consecutive nights, closing about midnight,
excepting on the last night, when the believers dance until daylight.
As daylight begins to appear in the east, they sing the song to the
morning star, as just given (number 72), and then, after a short rest,
the leaders start this, the closing song, which is sung while the
dancers make five circuits, resting a few moments between circuits.
Then they unclasp hands, wave their blankets in the air to fan away
all evil influences, and go down to the river to bathe, the men in
one place and the women in another. After bathing, they resume their
clothing and disperse to their various camps, and the Ghost dance is
over.


                           ARAPAHO GLOSSARY

In this and the other glossaries here given it is intended only to
give a concise definition of the meaning of each word without going
into details of grammar or etymology. The Ghost dance was studied for
its mythology, psychology, ritual, and history, and language in this
connection was only the means to an end, as it was impossible in a few
months of time to devote close attention to the numerous languages
spoken by the tribes represented in the dance.

The Arapaho language, as will be seen from the specimens given, is
eminently vocalic, almost every syllable ending in a vowel, and there
being almost no double consonant sounds. Like the Cheyenne language,
it lacks _l_ and _r_. The most prominent vowel sounds are _a_, _ä_,
and _i_, and in some instances there are combinations of several vowel
sounds without any intervening consonant. The soft _th_ sound is also
prominent. The _g_ and _d_ frequently approximate to _k_ and _t_,
respectively, and _b_ in the standard dialect becomes _v_ among the
northern Arapaho. The only sound of the language (excepting the medial
_k_ and _t_) not found in English is the gutteral _q_, and the language
is entirely devoid of the hissing effect of Cheyenne or the choking
sounds of Kiowa.

In the songs it is common to prefix _a_, and to add _i_, _hi_, _hu_,
_huhu_, etc, to the ends of words in order to fill out the meter. In
a few cases changes are made in the body of the word for the same
purpose. In the glossary these unmeaning syllables are not given where
they occur at the end of words. Words beginning with a vowel sound may
sometimes be written as beginning with the breathing _h_, and _s_ is
sometimes pronounced _sh_.

  _Aä′ninĕ′na_—the name by which the Arapaho Grosventres of the
      Prairie, one of the five principal divisions of the Arapaho,
      call themselves. It is said to signify “white clay men,” from
      _aäti_, “white clay,” and _hinĕ′na_, “men.” They are called
      _Hitu′nĕna_, or “beggars,” by the rest of the tribe, and
      are commonly known to the whites under the French name of
      Grosventres, “big bellies.”

  _Aanû′hawa_—another name for the Ha′nahawunĕ′na division of the
      Arapaho. The meaning of the word is unknown.

  _A′gană′_—bed-covers of buffalo skin; singular, _a′gă′_.

  _Aha′känĕ′na_—“crazy men,” one of the degrees of the Arapaho
      military organization. The word is derived from _aha′ka_,
      crazy, and _hinĕna_, men. The “fire moth,” which flies around
      and into the fire, is called _aha′kăa′_, or “crazy,” and the
      _Aha′känĕna_ are supposed to imitate the action of this moth in
      the fire dance. See Arapaho song 43 and Cheyenne song 10.

  _Aha′känithi′ĭ_—they are crazy. In the Indian idea “foolish” and
      “crazy” are generally synonymous. Compare _Aha′känen′a_ and
      _Ahaka′wŭ_.

  _Ahaka′wŭ_—the crazy dance. It is called _Psam_ by the Cheyenne,
      from _psa_, crazy. See Arapaho song 43 and Cheyenne song 10.

      _hinĕ′na_, “men.” One of the five bands of the southern Arapaho.

  +Ärä′păho+—the popular name for the Arapaho tribe. The derivation
      is uncertain, but it may be, as Dunbar suggests, from the
      Pawnee verb _tirapihu_ or _larapihu_, “he buys or trades,” in
      allusion to the Arapaho having formerly been the trading medium
      between the Pawnee, Osage, and others in the north, and the
      Kiowa, Comanche, and others to the southwest (_Grinnell_). It
      is worthy of note that old frontiersmen pronounce the name
      Aräpihu. It is not the name by which they are called by the
      Cheyenne, Sioux, Shoshoni, Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Caddo, or
      Wichita.

  +Äräpa′kata+—the Crow name for the Arapaho, evidently another form
      of the word Arapaho.

  _Atani′tanu′newa_—I use it. _Ati′tănu′wă_, use it! (imperative
      singular).

      stop! (singular imperative).

  _Ate′be_—for _Tĕ′bĕ_.

  _Ate′betana′-ise′ti_—for _Tĕ′bĕ‛tana′-isĕt_.

  _Ätĭ′‛chäbi′näsä′nă_—let us go out gambling.

  _Äti′chanĭ′na_—your pipes. _Hicha_, a pipe; _hiti′cha_, this pipe;
      _sĕ′icha_, the sacred “flat pipe.” See Arapaho song 2.

  _Atini′ehini′na_—for _Thĕni′ehi′nina_.

  +Atsi′na+—the Blackfoot name for the _Aä′ninĕna_ or Arapaho
      Grosventres. The word signifies “gut people.”

  _Awawa_—for _Wa′wa_.

  _Awatänani_—for _Watäna′ni_.

  _Awu′năni′ä_—another form of _ne′chawu′nani_—take pity on us.

  _Ba_(_-hu_)—a road or trail.

  _Ba′achinĕ′na_—Another name for the _Nakasinĕ′na_ (q. v.) or
      northern Arapaho. The word may mean “red willow (i. e.,
      kinikinik) men,” or “blood-pudding men,” the latter etymology
      being derived from _bä_, blood, and _chĭni′niki_, to put liquid
      into a bladder.

  _Bääku′ni_—“Red Feather,” the Arapaho name of Paul Boynton, a
      Carlisle student, and formerly interpreter at Cheyenne and
      Arapaho agency.

  _Baa′-ni′bina_—“thunder-berries,” from _băa′_, thunder, and
      _ni′bin_, berry; a wild fruit, perhaps the black haw. See
      Arapaho song 51.

  _Bääthi′na_—cedar tree. See Arapaho song 31.

  +Bad Pipes+—one of the three bands of the northern Arapaho. Their
      present chief is Sharp Nose.

  _Ba′haa′_, or _Băa′_—the Thunder. See Arapaho song 14.

  _Bähibiwă′hĭna_—on their account I am made to cry (immediate
      present). _Bäniwa′nă_ or _nibiwa′na_, I am crying;
      _hä′nibiwăhĭna_, on its account I am made to cry, for its sake
      I am crying; _nähibiwa′huna′na_, then I wept; _nähibiwa′huna_,

                            TRIBAL SYNONYMY

  _Ba′hakosĭn_—Caddo name; “striped arrows,” _băh_, arrow. The Caddo
      sometimes also call them Siä′näbo, from their Comanche name.

  _Cheyenne_—popular name, a French spelling of their Sioux name. It
      has no connection with the French word _chien_, “dog.”

  _Dzĭtsĭ′stäs_—proper tribal name; nearly equivalent to “our people.”

  _Gatsa′lghi_—Kiowa Apache name.

  _Hĭtäsi′na_ (singular _Hĭ′täsi_)—Arapaho name, signifying “scarred
      people,” from _hĭtäshi′ni_, “scarred or cut.” According to the
      Arapaho statement the Cheyenne were so called because they
      were more addicted than the other tribes to the practice of
      gashing themselves in religious ceremonies. The name may have
      more special reference to the tribal custom of cutting off the
      fingers and hands of their slain enemies. (See tribal sign,
      page 1024.)

  _Ităsupuzi_—Hidatsa name, “spotted arrow quills” (Matthews).

      Language, 99, 1885). The form should be _Dzĭtsĭ′stäs_ as given
      above.

  _Shaiela_ or _Shaiena_—Sioux name; “red,” or decorated with red
      paint. According to Riggs, as quoted by Clark, the Sioux call
      an alien language a “red” language, while they designate one
      of their own stock as “white,” so that the name would be
      equivalent to “aliens.” The Sioux apply the same name also to
      the Cree.

  _Shiä′navo_—another Comanche name, probably a derivative from the
      word _Cheyenne_.

  _Shiĕ′da_—another Wichita name, derived from the word _Cheyenne_.

  _Staitan_—unidentified tribal name, given, by Lewis and Clark.
      Identical with the Cheyenne, from their own word _Hĭstä′itän_,
      “I am a Cheyenne.”


                              TRIBAL SIGN

The Cheyenne tribal sign, made by drawing the right index finger
several times across the left forefinger, is commonly interpreted
“cut fingers” or “cut wrists,” and is said to be derived from their
custom of cutting off the fingers and hands of slain enemies. Although
the same practice was found among other tribes, the Cheyenne were
particularly distinguished in this regard. In Mackenzie’s great fight
with the Cheyenne in Wyoming, in 1876, two necklaces made of human
fingers were found in the captured Indian camp, together with a small
bag filled with hands cut from the bodies of children of the Shoshoni
tribe, their enemies. One of these necklaces was afterward deposited
in the National Museum at Washington. (See _Bourke_ in _Ninth Annual
Report of the Bureau of Ethnology_.) Some competent Indian authorities
say, however, that the sign is intended to indicate “stripe people,” or
“striped-arrow people,” referring to the fact that the Cheyenne usually
feathered their arrows with the striped feathers of the wild turkey.
This agrees with the interpretation of the name for the Cheyenne in
several different languages.


                          SKETCH OF THE TRIBE

The Cheyenne are one of the westernmost tribes of the great Algonquian
stock. In one of their ghost songs they sing of the “turtle river,”
on which they say they once lived. (_Cheyenne song 3._) From several
evidences this seems to be identical with the Saint Croix, which forms
the boundary between Wisconsin and Minnesota. This statement agrees
with the opinion of Clark (_Indian Sign Language_), who locates their
earliest tradition in the neighborhood of Saint Anthony falls. They
were driven out by the Sioux and forced toward the northwest, where
they came in contact with the Asiniboin (called by them Hohe′), with
whom they were never afterward at peace. At a later period, according
to Lewis and Clark, they lived on the Cheyenne branch of Red river, in
northern Minnesota, whence they were again driven by the Sioux into the
prairie.

In 1805 they wandered about the head of Cheyenne river of Dakota and
in the Black hills, and were at war with the Sioux, though at peace
with most other tribes. Since then they have pushed on to the west
and south, always in close confederation with the Arapaho. These two
tribes say they have never known a time when they were not associated.
About forty years ago, in Wyoming, the band since known as the northern
Cheyenne separated from the others (Clark), and have since lived
chiefly in Montana or with the Sioux, with whom the Cheyenne made
peace about sixty years ago. The other and larger portion of the tribe
continued to range chiefly on the lands of the Arkansas and Canadian
in Colorado and the western part of Kansas and Oklahoma. They and the
Arapaho made peace with the Kiowa and Comanche in 1840, and raided in
connection with these tribes into Texas and Mexico until assigned in
1869 to a reservation in what is now western Oklahoma. In 1874 they,
as well as the Kiowa, Comanche, and Kiowa Apache, again went on the
warpath in consequence of the depredations of the buffalo hunters,
but the outbreak was speedily suppressed. In 1890 they sold their
reservation and took allotments in severalty. The northern Cheyenne
joined the Sioux in the “Custer war” of 1876–77. At the surrender
of the hostiles they were removed to Oklahoma and placed with the
southern Cheyenne, but were much dissatisfied with their location, the
dissatisfaction culminating in the attempt of a large party, under Dull
Knife, to escape to the north, in September, 1878. They were pursued,
and a part of them captured and confined at Fort Robinson, Nebraska,
whence they made a desperate attempt to escape on the night of January
9, 1879, resulting in the killing of nearly all of the prisoners. They
were finally assigned a reservation in Montana, where they now are,
with the exception of a few among the Sioux. According to the official
report for 1892, the southern Cheyenne in Oklahoma numbered 2,119, the
northern Cheyenne in Montana, 1,200, and those with the Sioux at Pine
Edge, South Dakota, 120, a total of 3,439.

The Cheyenne have eleven tribal divisions. They have at least two
dialects, but probably more. The tribal divisions in their order in the
camping circle are—

1. _Evĭ′sts-unĭ′pahĭs_ (“smoky lodges”—Grinnell, _fide_ Clark).

2. _Sŭta′ya_ or _Sŭ′tasi′na_. This is one of the most important
divisions and formerly constituted a distinct tribe, but was afterward
incorporated with the Cheyenne. According to concurrent Cheyenne and
Blackfoot tradition, as given by Grinnell, they seem originally to have
been a part of the Blackfeet, who became separated from the main body
of their tribe by the sudden breaking up of the ice while crossing
a large river. They drifted to the southward and finally met and
joined the Cheyenne in the Black hills. Their name, spelled _Suti_ by
Grinnell, is said to mean “strange talkers.” They live now on the upper
Washita in Oklahoma and speak a dialect differing considerably from
that of the rest of the tribe.

3. _Ĭ′sium-itä′niuw’_, (“ridge-people;” singular,
_Ĭ′siumi-tän_—Grinnell, _fide_ Clark).

4. _Hĕwă-tä′niuw’_, “hairy men.” The name is also sometimes used
collectively to designate all of the southern Cheyenne as distinguished
from the northern Cheyenne, called collectively _Hmĭ′sĭs_. The southern
Cheyenne are also designated collectively as _So′wăniă_, “southerners.”

5. _Ŏ′ivimă′na_, “scabby.” This name is said to have been given them
originally on account of an epidemic which once broke out among their
horses and rendered them mangy.

6. _Wi′tapi′u_ (“haters”—Grinnell, _ƒide_ Clark).

7. _Hotă′mi-tä′niuw′_, “dog men,” or _Mĭ′stäviĭ′nût_, “heavy eyebrows.”
This is also the name of one of the divisions of their warrior
organization.

8. _O′tu′gŭnŭ._

9. _Hmĭ′sĭs_, “eaters.” This is the most important division of the
northern Cheyenne, and the name is also used by those of the south to
designate all the northern Cheyenne collectively.

10. _Anskowĭ′nĭs._

11. _Pĭnû′tgû′._

[Illustration: +Fig. 100+—Cheyenne camping circle.]

These are the names given to the author by the Cheyenne themselves
as the complete list of their tribal divisions. Grinnell, on the
authority of the Clark manuscript, names six of these with two others,
_Matsĭ′shkota_, “corpse from a scaffold,” and _Miayŭma_, “red lodges,”
which may be identical with some of the others named above, or may
perhaps be degrees of their military organization instead of tribal
divisions.

In the great ceremony of the “medicine arrow,” last enacted on the
Washita in 1890, the camping circle opened to the south. At all other
gatherings of the tribe the circle opened to the east, agreeable to
the general Indian custom, the several divisions encamping in the
order shown in figure 100.

The Cheyenne, like the prairie tribes generally, are, or were until
within a few years past, a nation of nomads, living in skin tipis, and
depending almost entirely on the buffalo for food. Yet they have a dim
memory of a time when they lived in permanent villages and planted
corn, and in their genesis tradition, which occupies four “smokes” or
nights in the telling, they relate how they “lost” the corn a long time
ago before they became wanderers on the plains. They deposit their
dead on scaffolds in trees, unlike their confederates, the Arapaho,
who bury in the ground. Their most sacred possession is the bundle
of “medicine arrows,” now in possession of the southern division of
the tribe. They have a military organization similar to that existing
among the Arapaho and other prairie tribes, as described under number
43 of the Arapaho songs. Above all the tribes of the plains they are
distinguished for their desperate courage and pride of bearing, and
are preeminently warriors among people whose trade is war. They are
strongly conservative and have steadily resisted every advance of
civilization, here again differing from the Arapaho, who have always
shown a disposition to meet the white man half-way. In fact, no two
peoples could well exhibit more marked differences of characteristics
on almost every point than these two confederated tribes. The Cheyenne
have quick and strong intelligence, but their fighting temper sometimes
renders them rather unmanageable subjects with whom to deal. Their
conservatism and tribal pride tend to restrain them from following
after strange gods, so that in regard to the new messiah they assume a
rather skeptical position, while they conform to all the requirements
of the dance code in order to be on the safe side.

Clark, in his _Indian Sign Language_, thus sums up the characteristics
of the Cheyenne:

  As a tribe they have been broken and scattered, but in their wild
  and savage way they fought well for their country, and their
  history during the past few years has been written in blood. The
  men of the Cheyenne Indians rank as high in the scale of honesty,
  energy, and tenacity of purpose as those of any other tribe I have
  ever met, and in physique and intellect they are superior to those
  of most tribes and the equal of any. Under the most demoralizing
  and trying circumstances they have preserved in a remarkable degree
  that part of their moral code which relates to chastity, and public
  sentiment has been so strong in them in regard to this matter that
  they have been, and are still, noted among all the tribes which
  surround them, for the virtue of their women.

The Cheyenne language lacks the liquids _l_ and _r_. It is full of
hissing sounds and difficult combinations of consonants, so that it
does not lend itself readily to song composition, for which reason,
among others, the Cheyenne in the south usually join the Arapaho in the
Ghost dance and sing the Arapaho songs.


                         SONGS OF THE CHEYENNE


                       1. +O′tä nä′nisĭ′näsists+

    Well, my children—_Ehe′e′ye′!_

    The earth will tremble—_E′ähe′e′ye′!_
    The summer cloud (?)
    It will give it to us,
    It will give it to us.

The interpretation of this song is imperfect and the meaning is not
clear. It evidently refers to the earthquake which it is supposed will
occur at the moment of contact of the spirit world with the old earth.
The literal meaning of the second line, rendered “when you meet your
friends again,” is “when you are living together again.”


                         2. +Ehä′n esho′ini′+

    Ehä′n esho′ini′,

    It is rising—_Eye′ye′!_
    It is humming—_Ahe′e′ye′!_
    It is humming—_Ahe′e′ye′!_

This is the song composed by Porcupine, the great leader of the Ghost
dance among the northern Cheyenne. It refers to the coming of the new
earth which is to come over this old world and which is represented as
making a humming or rolling noise as it swiftly approaches.

    Our father says so,
    Our father says so.

This song has a very pretty tune. The Cheyenne claim to have lived
originally in the north on a stream known to them as the “River of
Turtles.” Reverend H. R. Voth, former missionary among the Cheyenne
and Arapaho, states that the Indians say that along the banks of this
stream were clays of different colors which they used for paint. In
a letter of October 1, 1891, he says: “I have now in my possession
some red and some gray or drab paint that Black Coyote brought with
him from the north, which he claims came from that ancient Turtle
river, and which the Indians are now using to paint themselves. They
say there are more than two kinds of color at that river, or at least
used to be.” According to Clark (_Indian Sign Language_, page 99) the
oldest traditions of the Cheyenne locate their former home on the
headwaters of the Mississippi in Minnesota, about where Saint Paul now
is. Other facts corroborate this testimony, and the traditional “Turtle
river” would seem to be identical with the Saint Croix, which is thus
described by Coxe in 1741:

  A little higher up is the river Chabadeda, above which the
  Meschacebe makes a fine lake twenty miles long and eight or ten
  broad. Nine or ten miles above that lake, on the east side, is a
  large fair river, called the river of Tortoises, after you have
  entered a little way, which leads far into the country to the
  northeast, and is navigable by the greatest boats forty miles.
  About the same distance farther up, the Meschacebe is precipitated
  from the rocks about fifty feet, but is so far navigable by
  considerable ships, as also beyond, excepting another fall, eighty
  or ninety miles higher, by large vessels, unto its sources, which
  are in the country of the Sieux, not at a very great distance from
  Hudson’s bay. There are many other smaller rivers which fall into
  the Meschacebe, on both sides of it, but being of little note, and
  the description of them of small consequence, I have passed over
  them in silence. (Coxe, Carolana, 1741, in French’s Hist. Coll. of
  La., part 2, 233, 1850.)


                     4. +Nä′see′nehe′ ehe′yowo′mi+

    I waded into the yellow river,

    This was the Turtle river into which I waded,

This song is probably explained by the one immediately preceding.

    The mountain,
    It is circling around,
    It is circling around,
    _Ä′hiya′e′yee′heye′!
    Ä′hiya′e′yee′heye′!_

The interpretation of this song is not satisfactory. It was explained
that by the mountain was meant the new earth, which was represented as
approaching rapidly with a circular motion.


                          6. +Ni′ha-i′hi′hi′+

The connection of the crow with the doctrine of the Ghost dance has
already been explained. See Arapaho song 36.

    He has blest us—_Hi′hi′hai′-yai′!_
    He has blest us—_Hi′hi′hai′-yai′!_

It is hardly necessary to state that the idea of a devil is not
aboriginal, although now embodied in the Indian mythology and language
from contact with the whites. The “White Man Above” is understood to
mean the ruler whose precursor the messiah is, equivalent to our idea
of God.

    “You must take a bath“—_He′eye′!_”
    “You must take a bath”—_He′eye′!_”
    Thus he told me, thus he told me—_He′!_

Quite a number of the Cheyenne ghost songs refer to rivers seen in the
spirit world, these being frequently designated by colors, as yellow,
blue, etc. It may be that certain rivers play a prominent part in their
mythology, and as has been said they locate their earliest traditional
home on the “Turtle river.” The word here rendered “blue-green” might
mean either blue or green, as in Cheyenne and in many other Indian
languages the two colors are not differentiated. Compare Cheyenne song
number 16.

This song was composed by Mo ki, “Little Woman,” the Cheyenne wife of
Grant Left-hand. Although a young woman, she is regarded as a leader in
the Cheyenne Ghost dance, having been in frequent trances and composed
numerous songs. In this she relates her experience in one trance,
during which she and her girl comrade played together the woman’s game
of shinny, already described, and then went to look for their mothers,
who had gone to the spirit world years before.


                           10. +He′stutu′ai+

    The buffalo head—_Yä′hä′yä′!_
    The half buffalo—
    [_Ad libitum_].

This song refers to the crazy dance, which the author of the song
saw the former warriors of his tribe performing in the spirit world.
The crazy dance, called _Psam_ by the Cheyenne and _Ahaka′wŭ_ by the
Arapaho, belonged to one order of the military organization already
described in treating of the Arapaho songs. (See Arapaho song 43.)
The name in both languages is derived from the word for “crazy.” Men,
women, and children took part in the ceremony, dressed in skins or
other costume to represent various animals, as buffaloes, panthers,
deer, and birds, with one bear, two foxes, and seven wolves, besides
two “medicine wolves.” Each strove to imitate the animal personated
in action as well as in appearance. It was the business of the two
foxes to be continually running and stumbling over the others in their
efforts to escape from the crowd. The dance, whose essential feature
was the doing of everything by contraries, had its parallel among many
eastern tribes, particularly among the old Huron and Iroquois. It was
considered the most picturesque and amusing dance among the prairie
tribes. The “half buffalo” of the song refers to the robe worn by
certain of the dancers, which consisted of the upper half of a buffalo
skin, the head portion, with the horns attached, coming over the head
of the dancers. The dance was an exhibition of deliberate craziness in
which the performers strove to outdo one another in nonsensical and
frenzied actions, particularly in constantly doing the exact opposite
of what they were told to do. It was performed only in obedience to
a vow made by some person for the recovery of a sick child, for a
successful war expedition, or for some other Indian blessing. It lasted
four days, the performers dancing naked the first three days and in
full dance costume on the fourth. The leaders in the absurdities were
two performers whose bodies and cheeks were painted with white clay,
and whose ears were filled with hair shed by the buffalo, which was
believed to confer strong “medicine” powers. They carried whistles,
and shot at the spectators with blunt arrows. Almost every license was
permitted to these two, who in consequence were really held in dread
by the others. Among other things the crazy dancers were accustomed to
dance through a fire until they extinguished it by their tramping. This
was done in imitation of the fire-moth, called _aha′kăa′_, “crazy,”
by the Arapaho, which hovers about a flame or fire and finally flies
into it. They also handled poisonous snakes, and sometimes, it is
said, would even surround and kill a buffalo by their unaided physical
strength. The Cheyenne dance differed somewhat from that of the
Arapaho. It was last performed in the south about ten years ago.

    I bring the whirlwind with me—_E′yahe′eye′!_
    That you may see each other—
    That you may see each other.

The whirlwind is regarded with reverence by all the prairie tribes. In
the mythology of the Ghost dance it seems to be an important factor in
assisting the onward progress of the new world and the spirit army. It
is mentioned also in several Arapaho ghost songs.

    The crow, the crow,
    He is circling around,
    He is circling around,
    His wing, his wing—
    I am dancing with it,
    I am dancing with it.

This song refers to the sacred crow feathers, which certain of the
dancers wear upon their heads in the Ghost dance, as explained in the
Arapaho songs.

    My children, I am now humming—_He′eye′!_
    Your children, your children,
    They are crying—_He′eye′!_
    They are crying—_He′eye′!_
    They are hurrying me along,
    They are hurrying me along.

This song is supposed to be addressed by the father or messiah to his
disciples. He tells them that their children in the spirit world are
crying to be reunited with their friends here, and thus are hastening
their coming. The expression, “I am humming,” may possibly refer to his
rapid approach.

This song was composed by Grant Left-hand’s wife. The Crow is here
considered as the lord of the new spirit world.

    With the _ä‛ko′yo_ wheel.

This song was also composed by Mo′‛ki, the wife of Grant Left-hand. The
expression here rendered “my home” is literally “where I belonged,”
as, since the death of her children, she speaks of the spirit world as
her own proper home. In this song she tells how she found her departed
friends playing the game of the _ä‛ko′yo_ or _bä′qăti_ wheel, as
described in Arapaho song 49.

    He makes them swim—_He′eye′!_
    We are all crying—_Ähe′eye′!_
    We are all crying—_Ähe′eye′!_


This song conveys nearly the same idea as that of number 8. The
expression “We are all crying” might be rendered “We are all pleading,
or praying” to the father, to hasten his coming.

    It will make you strong,

    He tells me, He tells me.

Red is a sacred color with all Indians, and is usually symbolic of
strength and success, and for this reason is a favorite color in
painting the face and body for the dance or warpath, and for painting
the war pony, the lance, etc. On all important occasions, when painting
the face or body, the skin is first anointed with grease to make the
paint adhere better, so as not to obscure the sharp lines of the design.

    By that means I shall see you,
    By that means I shall see you.

This song refers to the feast which accompanies every dance. The
implied meaning is that the people must get ready for a dance in order
that they may see the Crow, their father.

This song was also composed by Mo′‛ki, “Little Woman,” the wife of
Grant Left-hand. On account of her frequent trances and consequent
leadership in the Cheyenne Ghost dance, she assumes the title of the
Crow Woman, i. e., the woman messenger from the spirit world. The story
of her own and her husband’s connection with the Ghost dance is of
interest for the light it throws on the working of the Indian mind,
especially with regard to religion.

Mo′‛ki is a young Cheyenne woman married to a young Arapaho, Grant
Left-hand, about 30 years of age, a former Carlisle student, and
the son of Nawat, or Left-hand, the principal chief of the southern
Arapaho. Notwithstanding several years of English education, Grant
is a firm believer in the doctrine and the dance, and the principal
organizer and leader of the auxiliary “crow dance” in his own tribe,
while his wife is as prominent in the Ghost dance among the Cheyenne,
and has composed a series of a dozen or more songs descriptive of her
various trance experiences in the other world.

Her first child died soon after birth, and the young mother was keenly
affected by the bereavement. Afterward a boy was born to them, and
became the idol of his parents, especially of the father. He grew up
into a bright and active little fellow, but when about 4 years of
age was suddenly seized with a spasm in the night and died in a few
minutes, almost before his father could reach his bed. This second loss
brought deep sorrow to them both, and the mother brooded over it so
that there was serious fear for her own life. Then came the Ghost dance
and the new doctrine of a reunion with departed friends. The mother
went to the dance, fell into a trance, met her children as in life,
and played with her little boy. On awaking and returning home she told
her husband. He could hardly believe it at first, but it required but
little persuasion to induce him to attend the next Ghost dance with
her, because, as he said, “I want to see my little boy.” He himself
fell into a trance, saw his children, and rode with his little boy
on the horse behind him over the green prairies of the spirit land.
From that time both became devoted adherents and leaders of the Ghost
dance; their trances have been frequent, and every dance is welcomed as
another opportunity of reunion with departed friends. The young man was
deeply affected as he spoke of his love for his children, the sudden
death of the little boy, and their second meeting in the other world,
and as his wife sat by his side looking up into our faces and listening
intently to every word, although she understood but little English, it
could not be doubted that their faith in the reality of the vision was
real and earnest. Every Indian parent who has lost a child, every child
who has lost a parent, and every young man and woman who has lost a
brother, sister, or friend affirms a similar reason for belief in the
Ghost dance.

                             THE COMANCHE


                            TRIBAL SYNONYMY

  _Bo′dălk̔′iñago_—common Kiowa name, signifying “reptile people” or
      “snake men,” from _bo′dal_, reptile, insect, and _k̔iñago_,
      people.

  _Cha‛tha_—(singular _Cha‛_), Arapaho name, signifying “enemies.”

  _Comanche_—popular name; of Mexican-Spanish origin and unknown
      meaning. It occurs as early as 1757, and in the form _Cumanche_
      as early as 1720.

  _Gyai′-ko_—the common name given by the Kiowa to the Comanche,
      signifying “enemies.”

  _Iatan_—the French spelling of the name applied by several of
      the plains tribes to the Ute Indians, and by extension to
      the cognate Comanche and Shoshoni. It is a derivative from
      the name Yuta or Ute, the final _n_ representing a nasalized
      vowel sound. The nearest approximation is perhaps _Iätä-go_,
      the Kiowa (plural) name for the Ute. Variants are _L’Iatan_,
      _Aliatan_, _Halitane_, _Ayutan_, _Tetau_ (for _Ietau_ or
      _Ietan_), _Jetan_, _Yutan_, etc. The form _Läitanes_ occurs as
      early as 1740 (Margry, +VII+, 457).

  _Idahi_—Kiowa Apache name; meaning unknown.

  _Ietan_—a name applied by some of the prairie tribes to several
      Shoshonean tribes, particularly the Shoshoni and the
      _Comanche_. It occurs in a number of forms and appears as
      _Läitanes_ as early as 1740 (Margry, +VII+, 457).

  _La Playe_—former French trader’s name, perhaps a corruption of
      _Tête Pele′e_.

  _Na′‛lani_—Navaho name, signifying “many aliens” or “many enemies,”
      applied collectively to the southern plains tribes, but more
      especially to the Comanche.

  _Na′nita_—Kichai name.

  _Na′tăa′_—Wichita name, variously rendered “snakes,” i. e.,
      “enemies” or “dandies.”

  _Nüma_—proper tribal name used by themselves, and signifying
      “people.” The Shoshoni and Paiute designate themselves by the
      same name.

  _Pa′douca_—the name given to the Comanche by the Osage, Quapaw,
      Kansa, Oto, and other Siouan tribes. It has several dialectic
      forms and is used in this form by Pénicaut as early as 1719. It
      may perhaps be a contraction of _Pe′nä-tĕka_, the name of the
      principal eastern division of the Comanche.

  _Sänko_—obsolete Kiowa name; it may signify “snakes,” from _säne_,
      snake.

  _Sau′hto_—Caddo name.

  _Shĭshino′wĭts-Itäniuw’_—Cheyenne name, signifying “snake people.”

  _Téte Pele′e_—a name said to have been applied to the Comanche by
      the French traders, signifying “bald heads.” The identification
      seems doubtful, as the Comanche cut their hair only when
      mourning.

  _Yä′mpai-ni_ or _Yä′mpai-Rĭ′kani_—Shoshoni name, signifying “yampa
      people,” or “yampa eaters.” It is properly the name of only one
      division, but is used collectively for the whole tribe. The
      yampa plant is the _Carum gairdneri_.


                              TRIBAL SIGN

The tribal sign for the Comanche is “snakes,” the same as that for the
Shoshoni, but with the finger drawn toward the rear instead of thrust
forward.


                          SKETCH OF THE TRIBE

The Comanche are one of the southern tribes of the great Shoshonean
stock, and the only one of that group living entirely on the plains.
Their language and traditions show that they are a comparatively
recent offshoot from the Shoshoni of Wyoming, both tribes speaking
practically the same dialect and until very recently keeping up
constant and friendly communication. Within the traditionary period
the two tribes lived adjacent to each other in southern Wyoming, since
which time the Shoshoni have been beaten back into the mountains by the
Sioux and other prairie tribes, while the Comanche have been driven
steadily southward by the same pressure. In this southern migration the
Pe′nätĕka seem to have preceded the rest of the tribe. The Kiowa say
that when they themselves moved southward from the Black-hills region,
the Arkansas was the northern boundary of the Comanche.

In 1719 the Comanche are mentioned under their Siouan name of Pa′douca
as living in what now is western Kansas. It must be remembered that
from 500 to 800 miles was an ordinary range for a prairie tribe,
and that the Comanche were equally at home on the Platte and in the
Bolson de Mapimi of Chihuahua. As late as 1805 the North Platte was
still known as Padouca fork. At that time they roamed over the country
about the heads of the Arkansas, Red, Trinity, and Brazos rivers, in
Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. For nearly two hundred years
they were at war with the Spaniards of Mexico and extended their raids
far down into Durango. They were friendly to the Americans generally,
but became bitter enemies of the Texans, by whom they were dispossessed
of their best hunting grounds, and carried on a relentless war against
them for nearly forty years. They have been close confederates of
the Kiowa for perhaps one hundred and fifty years. In 1835 they made
their first treaty with the government, and by the treaty of Medicine
Lodge in 1867 agreed to go on their present reservation, situated
between Washita and Red rivers, in the southwestern part of Oklahoma;
but it was not until after the last outbreak of the southern prairie
tribes in 1874–75 that they and their allies, the Kiowa and Apache,
finally settled on it. They were probably never a large tribe, although
supposed to be populous on account of their wide range. Within the last
fifty years they have been terribly wasted by war and disease. They
numbered 1,512 in 1893.

The gentile system seems to be unknown among the Comanche. They have,
or still remember, thirteen recognized divisions or bands, and may
have had others in former times. Of these all but five are practically
extinct. The Kwă′hări and Pe′nätĕka are the most important. Following
in alphabetic order is the complete list as given by their leading
chiefs:

1. _Detsăna′yuka_ or _No′koni_. This band, to which the present
head chief Quanah Parker belongs, was formerly called _No′koni_,
“wanderers,” but on the death of Quanah’s father, whose name was also
No′koni, the name was tabued, according to Comanche custom, and the
division took the name of _Detsăna′yuka_, “bad campers,” intended to
convey the same idea of wandering.

2. _Ditsä′kăna_, _Wĭ′dyu_, _Yäpä_, or _Yä′mpäri′ka_. This division was
formerly known as _Wĭ′dyu_, “awl,” but for a reason similar to that
just mentioned the name was changed to _Ditsä′kăna_, “sewers,” which
conveys the same idea, an awl being the substitute for a needle. They
are equally well known as _Yäpä_, the Comanche name of the root of the
_Carum gairdneri_, known to the Shoshoni and Bannock as _yampa_, or
sometimes as _Yämpä-ri′ka_, a dialectic form signifying “yampa eaters.”
The whole Comanche tribe is known to the Shoshoni under the name of
_Yä′mpaini_ or _Yämpai-rĭ′kani_, “yampa people” or “yampa eaters.”
The Yäpä are sometimes known also as _Etsitü′biwat_, “northerners,”
or “people of the cold country,” from having usually ranged along the
northern frontier of the tribal territory; a fact which may account for
the Shoshoni having designated the whole tribe by their name.

3. _Kewa′tsăna._ “No ribs;” extinct.

4. _Kotsa′i._ Extinct.

5. _Ko′tso-tĕ′ka._ “Buffalo eaters,” from _ko′tso_, buffalo, and
_tĕ′ka_, the root of the verb “to eat.”

6. _Kwa′hări_ or _Kwa′hădi_. “Antelopes.” This division was one of the
most important of the tribe, and was so called because its members
frequented the prairie country and the staked plains, while the
Pe′nätĕka and others ranged farther east on the edge of the timber
region. They were the last to come in after the surrender in 1874.
The Kwa′hări, Ditsä′kana, and Detsăna′yuka were sometimes designated
together by the whites as northern Comanche as distinguished from the
Pe′nätĕka, who were known as eastern or southern Comanche.

7. _Motsai′._ Perhaps from _pä-motsan_, “a loop in a stream.” These and
the Tĕna′wa were practically exterminated in a battle with the Mexicans
about 1845.

8. _Pä′gatsû._ “Head of the stream” (_pä_, a stream); extinct.

9. _Pe′nätĕka_, or _Penä′nde_. “Honey eaters.” These and the Kwa′hări
were the two most important divisions in the tribe. They lived on the
edge of the timber country in eastern Texas, and hence were frequently
known to the whites as eastern or southern Comanche. They had but a
loose alliance with their western kinsmen, and sometimes joined the
Texans against them. Other Comanche names for them are _Te′yuwĭt_,
“hospitable;” _Tĕ′‛kăpwai_, “no meat,” and _Ku′baratpat_, “steep
climbers.”

10. _Po′hoi._ “Wild-sage people,” i. e., Shoshoni. This is not properly
the name of a Comanche division, but of some immigrant Shoshoni from
the north incorporated with the Comanche.

11. _Tänĭ′ma._ “Liver eaters,” from _nĭm_ or _nüm_, liver. This band is
extinct, only one old man being known to survive.

12. _Tĕna′wa_ or _Te′nähwĭt_. From _tĕ′näw’_, “down stream.” Extinct.
See _Motsai′_ above.

13. _Wa-ai′h._ “Maggot.” Extinct.

The Comanche were nomad buffalo hunters, constantly on the move,
cultivating nothing from the ground, and living in skin tipis.
Excepting that they are now confined to a reservation and forced to
depend on government rations, they are but little changed from their
original condition. They are still for the most part living in tipis
of canvas, and are dressed in buckskin. They were long noted as the
finest horsemen of the plains, and bore a reputation for dash and
courage. They have a high sense of honor, and hold themselves superior
to the other tribes with which they are associated. In person they are
well built and rather corpulent. Their language is the trade language
of the region, and is more or less understood by all the neighboring
tribes. It is sonorous and flowing, its chief characteristic being a
rolling _r_. It has no _l_. The language has several dialects, and
is practically the same as that of the Shoshoni in the north. Their
present head chief is Quanah Parker, an able man, whose mother was an
American captive. His name, _Kwäna_ or _Kwai′na_, signifies a sweet
smell.

Having taken but little part in the Ghost dance, the Comanche have but
few songs in their own language, but these are particularly pleasing
for their martial ring or soothing softness. They call the dance
_A′p-Anĕ‛ka′ra_, “the father’s dance” (from _a′pă_, father; _nĕ‛ka′ra_,
a dance), or by another name which signifies the “dance with joined
hands.”


                         SONGS OF THE COMANCHE


                         1. +Heyo′hänä Häe′yo+

[Music]

    He′e′yo′!
    Heyo′hänä′ Häe′yo!
    Heyo′hänä′ Häe′yo!
    Te′äyä′ torä′bi ai′‛-gi′na—He′e′yo′!
    Te′äyä′ torä′bi ai′‛-gi′na—He′e′yo′!
    Te′äyä′ toa′hä tä′bi wo′n‛gin—Ăhi′ni′yo′!
    Te′äyä′ toa′hä tä′bi wo′n‛gin—Ăhi′ni′yo′!

                             _Translation_

    _He′e′yo′!
    Heyo′hänä′ Häe′yo!
    Heyo′hänä′ Häe′yo!_
    The sun’s beams are running out—_He′e′yo′!_
    The sun’s beams are running out—_He′e′yo′!_
    The sun’s yellow rays are running out—_Ähi′ni′yo′!_
    The sun’s yellow rays are running out—_Ähi′ni′yo′!_

This song was probably sung at daylight, when the first rays of the sun
shone in the east, after the dancers had been dancing all night. The
introductory part is a suggestion from the songs of the mescal rite, to
which the Comanche are so much attached. Although the words convey but
little meaning, the tune is unique and one of the best of all the ghost
songs on account of its sprightly measure.

_Te′äyä_ refers to the sun’s rays or beams; _torä′bi_, a possessive
form of _tä′bi_, sun; (_mû′ä_, moon); _toa′hä_, from _a′häp_, yellow;
_ai′‛-gi′na_ and _wo′n‛gin_ or _wa′n‛gin_, running out, streaming out.


                         2. +Ya′hi′yû′niva′hu+

    Ya′hi′yû′niva′hu
    Hi′yû′niva′hi′yû′niva′hu

    Hi′yû′niva′hu
    Hi′yû′niva′hi′yû′niva′hu
    Ya′hi′yû′niva′hi′ya′he′ne′na′.

This song has no meaning, but is of the lullaby order, with a sweet,
soothing effect.


                        3. +Yani′tsini′hawa′na+

    Yani′tsini′hawa′na!
    Yani′tsini′hawa′na!
    Hi′niswa′vita′ki′nĭ,
    Hi′niswa′vita′ki′nĭ.

                             _Translation_

    _Yani′tsini′hawa′na!
    Yani′tsini′hawa′na!_
    We shall live again,
    We shall live again.

The term _hi′niswa′vita′ki′nĭ_ signifies “we are coming to life again,”
or “we shall live again;” from _nüswa′vitaki′nĭ_, “I am beginning to be
alive again.”


                         4. +Ni′nini′tuwi′na+

    Ni′nini′tuwi′na hu′hu

    Wäta′tsina′na hu′hu
    Wäta′tsina′na hu′hu
    Ni′hima′tsi asi′si
    Ni′hima′tsi asi′si.

This is the Arapaho closing song (Arapaho song 52), as adopted by the
Comanche, to whom, of course, it has no real meaning. It is given here
as an example of the change which comes to an Indian song when adopted
by an alien tribe.


                THE PAIUTE, WASHO, AND PIT RIVER TRIBES


                        PAIUTE TRIBAL SYNONYMY

  _Hogăpä′goni_—Shoshoni name, “rush arrow people” (_hogăp_, a small
      water reed; _pägă_, “arrow”).

  _Nüma_—proper tribal name, signifying “people” or “Indians;” the
      same name is also used for themselves by the Shoshoni and
      Comanche.

  _Pai-yu′chimŭ_—Hopi name.

  _Pai-yu′tsĭ_—Navaho name.

  _Palŭ_—Washo name.

  _Paiute_ or _Piute_—popular name, variously rendered “true (_pai_)
      Ute” or “water (_pä_) Ute”—pronounced among themselves _Paiuti_.

  +Note.+—The northern bands of the Paiute are frequently included
  with Shoshoni and others under the name of Snakes, while the others
  are often included with various Californian tribes under the
  collective name of Diggers.


                         SKETCH OF THE PAIUTE


                            CHARACTERISTICS

The Paiute belong to the great Shoshonean stock and occupy most
of Nevada, together with adjacent portions of southwestern Utah,
northwestern Arizona, and northwestern and southeastern California.
The Pahvant and Gosiute on their eastern border are frequently, but
improperly, classed as Paiute, while the Chemehuevi, associated with
the Walapai in Arizona, are but a southern offshoot of the Paiute and
speak the same language. With regard to the Indians of Walker River
and Pyramid Lake reservations, who constitute the main body of those
commonly known as Paiute, Powell claims that they are not Paiute at
all, but another tribe which he calls Paviotso. He says: “The names by
which the tribes are known to white men and the department give no clue
to the relationship of the Indians. For example, the Indians in the
vicinity of the reservation on the Muddy and the Indians on the Walker
River and Pyramid Lake reservations are called Pai or Pah Utes, but
the Indians know only those on the Muddy by that name, while those on
the other two reservations are known as Paviotsoes, and speak a very
different language, but closely allied to, if not identical with, that
of the Bannocks.” (_Comr., 45._) The Ghost dance originated among these
Indians in the neighborhood of Walker river, from whom the songs here
given were obtained, and for convenience of reference we shall speak
of them under their popular title of Paiute, without asserting its
correctness.

The different small bands have little political coherence and there
is no recognized head chief. The most influential chiefs among them
in modern times have been Winnemucca, who died a few years ago, and
Natchez. Wovoka’s leadership is spiritual, not political. The Indians
of Walker river and Pyramid lake claim the Bannock as their cousins,
and say that they speak the same language. As a rule they have been
peaceable and friendly toward the whites, although in the early sixties
they several times came into collision with miners and emigrants,
hostility being frequently provoked by the whites themselves. The
northern Paiute are more warlike than those of the south, and a
considerable number of them took part with the Bannock in the war of
1878. Owing to the fact that the great majority of the Paiute are
not on reservations, many of them being attached to the ranches of
white men, it is impossible to get any correct statement of their
population, but they may be safely estimated at from 7,000 to 8,000
and are thought to be increasing. In 1893 those on reservations, all in
Nevada, were reported to number, at Walker River, 563; at Pyramid Lake,
494; at Duck Valley (Western Shoshone agency, in connection with the
Shoshoni), 209. Nevada Indians off reservation were estimated to number
6,815, nearly all of whom were Paiute.

As a people the Paiute are peaceable, moral, and industrious, and are
highly commended for their good qualities by those who have had the
best opportunities for judging. While apparently not as bright in
intellect as the prairie tribes, they appear to possess more solidity
of character. By their willingness and efficiency as workers, they have
made themselves necessary to the white farmers and have been enabled
to supply themselves with good clothing and many of the comforts of
life, while on the other hand they have steadily resisted the vices of
civilization, so that they are spoken of by one agent as presenting the
“singular anomaly” of improvement by contact with the whites. Another
authority says: “To these habits and excellence of character may be
attributed the fact that they are annually increasing in numbers,
and that they are strong, healthy, active people. Many of them are
employed as laborers on the farms of white men in all seasons, but
they are especially serviceable during the time of harvesting and
hay-making.” (_Comr., 46._) They would be the last Indians in the world
to preach a crusade of extermination against the whites, such as the
messiah religion has been represented to be. Aside from their earnings
among the whites, they derive their subsistence from the fish of the
lakes, jack rabbits and small game of the sage plains and mountains,
and from piñon nuts and other seeds which they grind into flour for
bread. Their ordinary dwelling is the wikiup or small rounded hut of
tulé rushes over a framework of poles, with the ground for a floor and
the fire in the center and almost entirely open at the top. Strangely
enough, although appreciating the advantages of civilization so far as
relates to good clothing and such food as they can buy at the stores,
they manifest no desire to live in permanent houses or to procure
the furniture of civilization, and their wikiups are almost bare of
everything excepting a few wicker or grass baskets of their own weaving.

The Paiute ghost songs have a monotonous, halting movement that
renders them displeasing to the ear of a white man, and are inferior
in expression to those of the Arapaho and the Sioux. A number of words
consisting only of unmeaning syllables are inserted merely to fill in
the meter. Like the cognate Shoshoni and Comanche, the language has a
strong rolling _r_.


                             GENESIS MYTH

At first the world was all water, and remained so a long time. Then the
water began to go down and at last Kura′ngwa (Mount Grant) emerged from
the water, near the southwest end of Walker lake. There was fire on its
top (it may have been a volcano), and when the wind blew hard the water
dashed over the fire and would have extinguished it, but that the
sage-hen (_hutsi_—_Centrocercus urophasianus_) nestled down over it and
fanned away the water with her wings. The heat scorched the feathers on
the breast of the sage-hen and they remain black to this day. Afterward
the Paiute got their first fire from the mountain through the help of
the rabbit, who is a great wonder-worker, “same as a god.” As the water
subsided other mountains appeared, until at last the earth was left as
it is now.

Then the great ancestor of the Paiute, whom they call _Nümi′naă′_,
“Our Father,” came from the south in the direction of Mount Grant,
upon which his footprints can still be seen, and journeyed across to
the mountains east of Carson sink and made his home there. A woman,
_Ibidsíi_, “Our Mother,” followed him from the same direction, and
they met and she became his wife. They dressed themselves in skins,
and lived on the meat of deer and mountain sheep, for there was plenty
of game in those days. They had children—two boys and two girls. Their
father made bows and arrows for the boys, and the mother fashioned
sticks for the girls with which to dig roots. When the children grew
up, each boy married his sister, but the two families quarreled until
their father told them to separate. So one family went to Walker lake
and became _Aga′ih-tĭka′ra_, “fish eaters” (the Paiute of Walker
lake), while the other family went farther north into Idaho and became
_Kotso′-tĭkăra_, “buffalo eaters” (the Bannock), but both are one
people and have the same language. After their children had left them,
the parents went on to the mountains farther east, and there _Nüminaă′_
went up into the sky and his wife followed him.


                               THE WASHO

Associated with the Paiute are the Washo, or _Wâ′siu_, as they call
themselves, a small tribe of about 400 souls, and having no affinity,
so far as known, with any other Indians. They occupy the mountain
region in the extreme western portion of Nevada, about Washo and Tahoe
lakes and the towns of Carson and Virginia City. They formerly extended
farther east and south, but have been driven back by the Paiute, who
conquered them, reducing them to complete subjection and forbidding
them the use of horses, a prohibition which was rigidly enforced until
within a few years. Thus broken in spirit, they became mere hangers-on
of the white settlements on the opening up of the mines, and are
now terribly demoralized. They have been utterly neglected by the
government, have never been included in any treaty, and have now no
home that they can call their own. They are devoted adherents of the
messiah, but usually join in the dance with the nearest camp of Paiute,
whose songs they sing, and have probably no Ghost songs in their own
language. We quote a gloomy account of their condition in 1866. The
description will apply equally well today, excepting that their numbers
have diminished:

  This is a small tribe of about 500 Indians, living in the extreme
  western part of the state. They are usually a harmless people, with
  much less physical and mental development than the Paiutes, and
  more degraded morally. They are indolent, improvident, and much
  addicted to the vices and evil practices common in savage life.
  They manifest an almost uncontrollable appetite for intoxicating
  drinks. They are sensual and filthy, and are annually diminishing
  in numbers from the diseases contracted through their indulgences.
  A few have learned the English language and will do light work
  for a reasonable compensation. They spend the winter months about
  the villages and habitations of white men, from whom they obtain
  tolerable supplies of food and clothing. The spring, summer, and
  autumn months are spent in fishing about Washo and Tahoe lakes and
  the streams which flow through their country. They also gather
  grass seed and pine nuts, hunt rabbits, hares, and ducks. There
  is no suitable place for a reservation in the bounds of their
  territory, and, in view of their rapidly diminishing numbers
  and the diseases to which they are subjected, none is required.
  (_Comr., 47._)


                         THE PIT RIVER INDIANS

Another group of Indians closely associated with the Paiute on the
northwest consists of a number of small tribes, known collectively to
the whites as Pit River or Hot Springs Indians, holding the basin of
Pit river in northeastern California from Goose lake to the junction
with the Sacramento. Among their tribes or bands are the Achoma′wi,
Huma′whi, Estakéwach, Hantéwa, Chumâ′wa, Atua′mih or Hamefku′ttelli,
Ilma′wi, and Pa′kamalli. (_Powers_, _Tribes of California_.) They are
at present supposed to constitute a distinct linguistic group, but it
is probable that better information will show their affinity with some
of the neighboring Californian stocks. With the exception of a few at
Round Valley reservation, California, none of them are on reservations
or have any official recognition by the government. They probably
number 1,000 to 1,500 souls. The northern bands have suffered much from
Modoc slave raids in former days, and are much inferior in physique
and intellect to those lower down the river, who were the terror of
northern California thirty years ago, and who are described by recent
observers as good workers, intelligent, brave, and warlike. (_A. G. O.,
9._)


                          SONGS OF THE PAIUTE


                        1. +Nüvä′ ka ro′răni′+

    Nüvä′ ka ro′răni′!
    Nüvä′ ka ro′răni′!
    Nüvä′ ka ro′răni′!
    Nüvä′ ka ro′răni′!
    Gosi′pa′ hävi′gĭnû′,
    Gosi′pa′ hävi′gĭnû′.

                             _Translation_

    The snow lies there—_ro′răni′!_
    The snow lies there—_ro′răni′!_
    The snow lies there—_ro′răni′!_
    The snow lies there—_ro′răni′!_
    The Milky Way lies there,
    The Milky Way lies there.

This is one of the favorite songs of the Paiute Ghost dance. The tune
has a plaintive but rather pleasing effect, although inferior to the
tunes of most of the ghost songs of the prairie tribes. The words as
they stand are very simple, but convey a good deal of meaning to the
Indian. It must be remembered that the dance is held in the open air
at night, with the stars shining down on the wide-extending plain
walled in by the giant sierras, fringed at the base with dark pines,
and with their peaks white with eternal snows. Under such circumstances
this song of the snow lying white upon the mountains, and the Milky
Way stretching across the clear sky, brings up to the Paiute the same
patriotic home love that comes from lyrics of singing birds and leafy
trees and still waters to the people of more favored regions. In the
mythology of the Paiute, as of many other tribes, the Milky Way is the
road of the dead to the spirit world. _Ro′răni′_ serves merely to fill
in the meter.


                           2. +Dĕna′ gayo′n+

    Dĕna′ gayo′n, Dĕ′na ga′yoni′,
    Dĕna′ gayo′n, Dĕ′na ga′yoni′,

                             _Translation_

    A slender antelope, a slender antelope,
    A slender antelope, a slender antelope,
    He is wallowing upon the ground,
    He is wallowing upon the ground,
    He is wallowing upon the ground,
    He is wallowing upon the ground.

This song evidently refers to a trance vision in which the sleeper saw
an antelope rolling in the dust, after the manner of horses, buffalo,
and other animals.


                            3. +Do′ tĭ′mbi+

    Do′ tĭ′mbi, Do′ tĭ′mbi-nä′n,
    Do′ tĭ′mbi, Do′ tĭ′mbi-nä′n,
    Tĭ′mbi bai′-yo, Tĭ′mbi ba′i-yo-ä′n,
    Tĭ′mbi bai′-yo, Tĭ′mbi ba′i-yo-ä′n.

                             _Translation_

    The black rock, the black rock,
    The black rock, the black rock,
    The rock is broken, the rock is broken,
    The rock is broken, the rock is broken.

This song may refer to something in Paiute mythology. _Nä′n_ and _ä′n_
are unmeaning syllables added to fill out the measure.


                         4. +Päsü′ wĭ′noghän+

    Päsü′ wĭ′noghän,
    Päsü′ wĭ′noghän,
    Päsü′ wĭ′noghän,
    Wai′-va wĭ′noghän,
    Wai′-va wĭ′noghän,
    Wai′-va wĭ′noghän.

                             _Translation_

    The wind stirs the willows,
    The wind stirs the willows,
    The wind stirs the willows,
    The wind stirs the grasses,
    The wind stirs the grasses,
    The wind stirs the grasses.

_Wai′-va_ (or _wai_ in composition) is the sand grass or wild millet of
Nevada (_Oryzopsis membranacea_), the seeds of which are ground by the
Paiute and boiled into mush for food.


                            5. +Pägü′nävä′+

    Pägü′nävä′! Pägü′nävä′!
    Tûngwü′kwiji′! Tûngwü′kwiji′!
    Wûmbe′doma′! Wûmbe′doma′!

                             _Translation_

    Fog! Fog!
    Lightning! Lightning!
    Whirlwind! Whirlwind!

This song is an invocation of the elemental forces. It was composed by
an old woman, who left the circle of dancers and stood in the center of
the ring while singing it.


                          6. +Wûmbĭ′ndomä′n+

    Wûmbĭ′ndomä′n, Wûmbĭ′ndomä′n,
    Wûmbĭ′ndomä′n, Wûmbĭ′ndomä′n.
    Nuvä′rĭ′p noyo′wană′, Nuvä′rĭ′p noyo′wană′,
    Nuvä′rĭ′p noyo′wană′, Nuvä′rĭ′p noyo′wană′.

                             _Translation_

                    The whirlwind! The whirlwind!
                    The whirlwind! The whirlwind!
    The snowy earth comes gliding, the snowy earth comes gliding;
    The snowy earth comes gliding, the snowy earth comes gliding.

This song may possibly refer to the doctrine of the new earth, here
represented as white with snow, advancing swiftly, driven by a
whirlwind. Such an idea occurs several times in the Arapaho songs.


                        7. +Kosi′ wûmbi′ndomä′+

    Kosi′ wûmbi′ndomä′,
    Kosi′ wûmbi′ndomä′,
    Kosi′ wûmbi′ndomä′.
    Kai′-va wûmbi′ndomä′,

                             _Translation_

    The rocks are ringing,
    The rocks are ringing,
    The rocks are ringing.
    They are ringing in the mountains,
    They are ringing in the mountains,
    They are ringing in the mountains.

This song was explained to refer to the roaring of a storm among the
rocks in the mountains.


                        9. +Sû′ng-ä ro′yonji′+

    Sû′ng-ä ro′yonji′, Sû′ng-ä ro′yon,
    Sû′ng-ä ro′yonji′, Sû′ng-ä ro′yon,

    The cottonwoods are growing tall.
    They are growing tall and verdant,
    They are growing tall and verdant,
    They are growing tall and verdant.

This song seems to refer to the return to spring. Throughout the arid
region of the west the cottonwood skirting the borders of the streams
is one of the most conspicuous features of the landscape. See Arapaho
song 13.

                            TRIBAL SYNONYMY

  _Chahrarat_—Pawnee name (Grinnell).

  _Dakota_, _Nakota_, or _Lakota_—proper tribal name, according
      to dialect, “allies, friends;” sometimes also they speak of
      themselves as _Oceti Sakowin_, the “seven council fires,” in
      allusion to their seven great divisions.

  _Itahatski_—Hidatsa name, “long arrows” (Matthews).

  _K̔odalpä-K̔iñago_—Kiowa name, “necklace people,” perhaps a
      misconception of neck-cutting people, i. e., beheaders.

  _Maranshobishgo_—Cheyenne name, “cut-throats” (Long). The name is
      plainly incorrect, as the Cheyenne language has no _r_.

  _Nadowesi_ or _Nadowesiu_—“little snakes” or “little enemies,”
      _Nadowe_, “snake” and figuratively “enemy,” being the common
      Algonquian term for all tribes of alien lineage. The Ojibwa
      and others designated the Iroquois, living east of them,
      as _Nadowe_, while the Sioux, living to the west, were
      distinguished as _Nadowesi_ or _Nadowesiu_, whence come
      Nadouessioux and Sioux.

  _Natnihina_ or _Natni_—Arapaho name; Hayden gives the form as
      _Natenehina_, which he renders “cut-throats or beheaders,” but
      it may be derived from _Nadowe_, as explained above.

  _Niake′tsikûtk_—Kichai name.

  _Pambizimina_—Shoshoni name, “beheaders.”

  _Papitsinima_—Comanche name, “beheaders,” from _papitsi_,
      signifying to behead, and _nĭma_ or _nüma_, people.

  _Shahañ_—Osage, Kansa, Oto, etc, name (Dorsey).

  _Sioux_—popular name, abbreviated from Nadouessioux, the French
      form of their Ojibwa name.

  _Tsaba′kosh_—Caddo name, “cut-throats.”


                              TRIBAL SIGN

A sweeping pass of the right hand in front of the neck, commonly
rendered “cut-throats” or “beheaders,” but claimed by the Kiowa to
refer to a kind of shell necklace formerly peculiar to the Sioux.


                          SKETCH OF THE TRIBE

The Sioux constitute the largest tribe in the United States, and are
too well known to need an extended description here. Although now
thought of chiefly as a prairie tribe, their emergence upon the plains
is comparatively recent, and within the historic period their range
extended as far eastward as central Wisconsin, from which, and most of
Minnesota, they have been driven out by the westward advance of the
Ojibwa. There is ground for believing that the true home of the whole
Siouan stock is not in the west, or even in the central region, but
along the south Atlantic slope. (See the author’s _Siouan Tribes of the
East_.)

The Sioux language has three well-marked dialects—the eastern or
Santee, the middle or Yankton (including the Asiniboin in the north),
and the western or Teton. The tribe consists of seven great divisions,
each of which again has or had subdivisions. Dorsey enumerates over one
hundred in all. Each grand division had its own camping circle, and
when two or more such divisions camped together they usually camped
in concentric circles. (_Dorsey._) The seven great divisions are: 1.
_Mde-wakañ-toñwañ_ (Medewacanton), “village of the Spirit lake;” 2.
_Waqpekute_ (Wahpacoota), “leaf shooters;” 3. _Waqpetoñwañ_ (Wahpeton),
“leaf village;” 4. _Sisitoñwañ_ (Sisseton), variously rendered “slimy
village” or “swamp village;” 5. _Ihanktoñwañ_ (Yankton), “end village;”
6. _Ihanktoñwañna_ (Yanktonais), “upper end village;” 7. _Titoñwañ_
(Teton), “prairie village.”

The first four divisions collectively are known as Isañati or Santee
Sioux. The name is supposed to be derived from _isañ_, the dialectic
word for “knife.” They formerly held Mississippi, Minnesota, and upper
Red rivers in Minnesota and were afterward gathered on reservations
at Devils lake, North Dakota; Lake Traverse (Sisseton agency) and
Flandreau, South Dakota; and Santee agency, Nebraska. Those at Lake
Traverse and Flandreau have now taken allotments as citizens.

The Yankton and Yanktonais, together speaking the middle dialect,
occupied chiefly the country of James river, east of the Missouri, in
North Dakota and South Dakota and extending into Iowa. They are now
on Yankton and Crow Creek reservations in South Dakota, and Fort Peck
reservation, Montana.

The Teton constitute more than two-thirds of the whole Sioux tribe, and
held nearly the whole country southwest of the Missouri from Cannonball
river to the South Platte, extending westward beyond the Black hills.
They are all now on reservations in South and North Dakota. They
are again subdivided into seven principal divisions: 1. _Sichañgu_,
“burnt thighs” (Brulés), now on Rosebud reservation; 2. _Ogalala_,
referring to “scattering” of dust in the face (Clark), now on Pine
Ridge reservation, under the celebrated chief Red Cloud (_Maqpe-Luta_);
3. _Hunkpapa_, “those who camp at the end (or opening) of the camping
circle” (Clark), on Standing Rock reservation; 4. _Minikañzu_,
“those who plant by the water,” on Cheyenne River reservation; 5.
_Itazipko_, “without bows” (Sans Arcs), on Cheyenne River reservation;
6. _Sihasapa_, “black feet” (not to be confounded with the Blackfoot
tribe), on Cheyenne River and Standing Rock reservations; 7.
_Ohenoñpa_, “two kettles,” on Cheyenne River and Rosebud reservations.
According to the official report for 1893, the Sioux within the United
States number about 23,410, which, with 600 permanently settled in
Manitoba, make the whole population about 24,000 souls.

The Sioux, under the name of Nadouessi, are mentioned by the Jesuit
missionaries as early as 1632. They made their first treaties with
our government in 1815. The most prominent events in their history
since that date have been the treaty of Prairie du Chien in 1825,
which defined their eastern boundary and stopped the westward advance
of the Ojibwa; the Minnesota massacre of 1862, which resulted in the
expulsion of the Sioux from Minnesota; the Sioux war of 1876–77,
largely consequent on the unauthorized invasion of the Black hills by
miners, and the chief incident of which was the defeat and massacre
of an entire detachment under General Custer; the treaty by which the
great reservation was broken up in 1889, and the outbreak of 1890, with
the massacre of Wounded Knee.

By reason of their superior numbers the Sioux have always assumed,
if not exercised, the lordship over all the neighboring tribes with
the exception of the Ojibwa, who, having acquired firearms before the
Sioux, were enabled to drive the latter from the headwaters of the
Mississippi, and were steadily pressing them westward when stopped by
the intervention of the United States government. The Sioux in turn
drove the Cheyenne, Crow, Kiowa, and others before them and forced
them into the mountains or down into the southern prairies. The
eastern bands were sedentary and largely agricultural, but the Teton
were solely and preeminently wandering buffalo hunters. All dwelt in
_tipis_—the word is from the Sioux language—which were of bark in
the timber country and of buffalo skins on the plains. In warlike
character they are probably second only to the Cheyenne, and have an
air of proud superiority rather unusual with Indians. Clark says of
them, “In mental, moral, and physical qualities I consider the Sioux
a little lower but still nearly equal to the Cheyenne, and the Teton
are the superior branch of the family.” (_Indian Sign Language_, 345.)
The eastern Sioux are now far advanced toward civilization through the
efforts of teachers and missionaries for over a generation, and the
same is true in a less degree of the Yankton, while the majority of the
Teton are still nearly in their original condition.

I found the Sioux very difficult to approach on the subject of the
Ghost dance. This was natural, in view of the trouble that had
resulted to them in consequence of it. When I was first at Pine Ridge,
the troops still camped there served as a reminder of the conflict,
while in the little cemetery at the agency were the fresh graves of
the slain soldiers, and only a few miles away was the Wounded Knee
battlefield and the trench where the bodies of nearly three hundred
of their people had been thrown. To my questions the answer almost
invariably was, “The dance was our religion, but the government sent
soldiers to kill us on account of it. We will not talk any more about
it.” Another reason for their unwillingness was the fact that most
of the interpreters were from the eastern or Santee portion of the
tribe, and looked with contempt on the beliefs and customs of their
more primitive western brethren, between whom and themselves there was
in consequence but little friendly feeling. On one occasion, while
endeavoring to break the ice with one of the initiates of the dance, I
told him how willingly the Arapaho had given me information and even
invited me to join in the dance. “Then,” said he, “don’t you find that
the religion of the Ghost dance is better than the religion of the
churches?” I could not well say yes, and hesitated a moment to frame an
answer. He noticed it at once and said very deliberately, “Well, then,
if you have not learned that you have not learned anything about it,”
and refused to continue the conversation.

The Sioux ghost songs are all in the dialect of the Teton, who took the
most active interest in the dance, which was hardly known among the
bands east of the Missouri. The vocalic character of the language, and
the frequent liquid _l_ of this dialect, renders these songs peculiarly
musical, while for beauty of idea and expression they are second only
to those of the Arapaho.

                        1. +A′te he′ye e′yayo+

    You shall see your kindred—_E′yayo′!_
    You shall see your kindred—_E′yayo′!_
    The father says so,
    The father says so.

This is the opening song of the dance. While singing it, all the
dancers stand motionless with hands stretched out toward the west, the
country of the messiah and the quarter whence the new spirit world is
to come. When it is ended, all cry together, after which they join
hands and begin to circle around to the left. “Grandfather,” as well as
“father,” is a reverential term applied to the messiah.

    Says the father,
    Says the father.

This song refers to the sacred pipe which, according to the Sioux
tradition, was brought to them by a mysterious young woman from the
spirit world. The story, as outlined by Captain J. M. Lee, is as
follows: In the old times the Sioux were always at war, not only with
other tribes, but also among themselves. On one occasion two young men
were out hunting when they saw a young woman approaching them with
folded arms. Seeing that she was not of their own tribe, one proposed
to the other that they kill her, but he refused and urged that they
wait until they learned what she wanted. The first speaker, however,
was about to kill her as she drew near, when she suddenly stooped down
and took from around her ankle something resembling an anklet, which
she waved about her head. The motion was so rapid that it seemed as
though a cloud encircled her for a few moments, when she ceased, and
the snake which she had taken from off her ankle glided away through
the grass. But the young warrior who had thought to kill her had
disappeared, swept from the face of the earth.

Turning now to his companion, she said, “To you I come as a friend and
helper. Your people have been killing each other. I bring you a pipe,
which is a token of peace,” and she held out a pipe as she spoke. “When
you smoke it your thoughts will be of peace, and no murderer (i. e., no
one who kills a member of his own tribe) must be allowed to smoke it.”
She returned with him to his village, where the women prepared for her
reception a large tipi, to which the chiefs of the tribe came to listen
to her instructions. She taught them to be at peace with one another,
if they would be happy, and when they listened to her words and
accepted her teachings, she gave them the sacred medicine pipe to smoke
thenceforth in their councils as a perpetual reminder of the peace
covenant of the Lakota. Her mission now ended, she said she must leave
them, and although they begged her earnestly to stay with them, she
could not tarry longer, but disappeared as suddenly and mysteriously as
she had come.

A variant of this legend is given by Colonel Mallery in his paper
in the Tenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, where it is
illustrated by a colored plate from a picture by the Indian story
teller. According to this version, the pipe maiden was the mysterious
white Buffalo Cow, and brought, with the pipe, a package of four
grains of maize of different colors. This corn sprang from the milk
which dropped from her udder, and was thus, with the flesh of the
buffalo itself, appointed from the beginning to be the food of all
the red tribes. The seeming snakes about her waist and ankles were
really blades of grass (corn?). She taught the people to call her
“grandmother,” a reverential title among Indians, and after leading
them to her relatives, the buffalo, she faded from their sight as they
stood gazing at her.

The pipe holds an important part in the mythology and ritual of almost
all our tribes, east and west, and no great ceremony is complete and
no treaty was ever ratified without it. It is generally symbolic of
peace and truth. As a peace emblem, it was formerly carried by every
bearer of a friendly message from one tribe to another and was smoked
in solemn ratification of treaties, the act of smoking being itself
in the nature of an oath. Among the prairie tribes an individual
accused of crime is offered the sacred pipe, and if he accepts it and
smokes he is declared innocent, as no Indian would dare to smoke it if
guilty. The ordinary ceremonial pipe of the prairie tribes is made of
the red stone, known as catlinite, from the famous pipestone quarry
in Minnesota in the old country of the Sioux. The peace pipe of the
Cherokee was made of a white stone, somewhat resembling talc, from a
quarry near Knoxville, Tennessee. It is said to have had seven stem
holes, emblematic of the seven clans of the Cherokee, and was smoked
by seven counselors at the same time. In every case the tribe has a
legend to account for the origin of the pipe. A flat pipe is the tribal
“medicine” of the Arapaho, and is still preserved with the northern
band in Wyoming. (See Arapaho songs 1 and 2.) Besides the stone pipe,
there are also in use pipes of clay or bone, as well as cigarettes,
but as a rule no ceremonial character attaches to these. In ceremonial
smoking the pipe is passed around the circle of councilors, each of
whom takes only a few whiffs and then hands it to his neighbor. Each
one as he receives the pipe offers it first to the sun, holding the
bowl up toward the sky and saying, “Grandfather, smoke;” then to the
earth, the fire, and perhaps also to each of the four cardinal points
and to one or another of their mythologic heroes. Among the Kiowa I
have seen a man hold up the pipe to the sky, saying, “Smoke, Sinti”
(Sinti being their great mythologic trickster), and then in the same
way, “Smoke, Jesus.”

In the Ghost dance at Rosebud and Pine Ridge, as usually performed,
a young woman stood in the center of the circle holding out a pipe
toward the messiah in the west, and remained thus throughout the dance.
Another young woman usually stood beside her holding out a _bäqati_
wheel (see Arapaho song 49) in the same way. This feature of the dance
is said to have been introduced by Short Bull.

In this the singer tells how he was greeted by his former friend upon
entering the spirit world, to which he had gone in search of his mother.


                         4. +Wana′yañ ma′niye+

    Now he is walking,
    Now he is walking.
    There is a buffalo bull walking,
    There is a buffalo bull walking,
    Says the father,
    Says the father.

The maker of this song, in her vision of the spirit world, evidently
saw a herd of buffalo, with a bull walking about near them. The form of
the verb shows that a woman is supposed to be talking.

    When it is dry I shall make pemmican,
    When it is dry I shall make pemmican,
    Says grandmother—_Yo′yo!_
    Says grandmother—_Yo′yo!_

This song brings up a vivid picture of the old Indian life. In her
trance vision the old grandmother whose experience it relates came upon
her friends in the spirit world just as all the women of the camp were
engaged in cutting up the meat for drying after a successful buffalo
hunt. In her joy she calls for her knife to assist in the work, and
says that as soon as the meat is dry she will make some pemmican.

[Illustration: +Fig. 103+—Jerking beef.]

In the old days an Indian camp during the cutting up of the meat after
a buffalo hunt was a scene of the most joyous activity, some faint
recollection of which still lingers about ration day at the agency.
Thirty years ago, when a grand hunt was contemplated, preparations
were made for days and weeks ahead. Couriers were sent out to collect
the neighboring bands at a common rendezvous, medicine-men began
their prayers and ceremonies to attract the herd, the buffalo songs
were sung, and finally when all was ready the confederated bands or
sometimes the whole tribe—men, women, children, horses, dogs, and
travois—moved out into the buffalo grounds. Here the immense camp of
hundreds of tipis was set up, more ceremonies were performed, and
the mounted warriors rode out in a body to surround and slaughter the
herd. The women followed close after them to strip the hides from
the fresh carcasses and cut out the choice portion of the meat and
tallow and bring it into camp. Here the meat was cut into thin strips
and hung upon frames of horizontal poles to dry, while the tallow
was stripped off in flakes. In the dry prairie atmosphere one day is
usually sufficient to cure the meat, without the aid of salt or smoke.
When thus dried it is known as “jerked beef.” While the meat is fresh,
for the first day or two the camp is a scene of constant feasting, the
juicy steaks or the sweet ribs being kept broiling over the coals in
one tipi or another until far into the night. It is the harvest home
of the prairie tribes. As soon as the meat is dry, the tipis are taken
down and packed into the wagons along with the meat, and one family
after another starts for home until in a short time the great camp is a
thing of the past.

The jerked beef or venison is commonly prepared for eating by being
boiled until reasonably tender. In eating, the Indian takes a strip
thus cooked, dips one end into a soup made by dissolving some salt in
warm water, takes the portion thus salted between his teeth, and saws
off enough for a mouthful with a knife held in his other hand. Between
mouthfuls he takes bites from a strip of dried tallow placed in the
dish with the meat.

For pemmican the jerked beef or other meat is toasted over a fire until
crisp and is then pounded into a hash with a stone hammer. In the
old times a hole was dug in the ground and a buffalo hide was staked
over so as to form a skin dish, into which the meat was thrown to be
pounded. The hide was that from the neck of the buffalo, the toughest
part of the skin, the same used for shields, and the only part which
would stand the wear and tear of the hammers. In the meantime the
marrow bones are split up and boiled in water until all the grease
and oil come to the top, when it is skimmed off and poured over the
pounded beef. As soon as the mixture cools, it is sewed up into skin
bags (not the ordinary painted parfléche cases) and laid away until
needed. It was sometimes buried or otherwise cached. Pemmican thus
prepared will keep indefinitely. When prepared for immediate use, it is
usually sweetened with sugar, mesquite pods, or some wild fruit mixed
and beaten up with it in the pounding. It is extremely nourishing, and
has a very agreeable taste to one accustomed to it. On the march it was
to the prairie Indian what parched corn was to the hunter of the timber
tribes, and has been found so valuable as a condensed nutriment that
it is extensively used by arctic travelers and explorers. A similar
preparation is in use upon the pampas of South America and in the
desert region of South Africa, while the canned beef of commerce is an
adaptation from the Indian idea. The name comes from the Cree language,
and indicates something mixed with grease or fat. (_Lacombe._)

    This one says—_Ye′ye!_
    This one says—_Ye′ye!_
    I belong indeed to the nation of Crows,
    I belong indeed to the nation of Crows.

This song may better be rendered, “I am a Crow nation,” i. e., I
represent the nation of Crows, the Crow nation probably typifying the
spirits of the dead in the other world, as explained in Arapaho song
36. In several of the ghost songs there occur such expressions as “I am
a Crow,” “the Crow woman is going home,” etc. Compare Sioux song 18.


                       9. +Niya′te-ye′ he′uw′e+

    It is your father coming, it is your father coming,
    A spotted eagle is coming for you,
    A spotted eagle is coming for you.

This song probably refers to a transformation trance vision, such as
is frequently referred to in the ghost songs, where the spirit friend
suddenly assumes the form of a bird, a moose, or some other animal.


                      10. +Miyo′qañ kiñ wañla′ki+

    You see what I can do—_Ye′yeye′!_
    You see them, you see them,
    _Ha′eye′ya he′yeye′! Ha′eye′ya he′yeye′!_

In this song the Father is probably represented as calling his children
to witness that he has shown them visions of the spirit world and their
departed friends.


                      11. +Michĭ′nkshi mita′waye+

    _E′yaye′ye′! E′yaye′ye′!_
    It is my own child,
    It is my own child.

The form of the verb indicates that this song was composed by a woman,
who had evidently met her dead child in the spirit world.


                          12. +A′te he′ u-we+

    There is the father coming,
    There is the father coming.
    The father says this as he comes,
    The father says this as he comes,
    “You shall live,” he says as he comes,
    “You shall live,” he says as he comes.

This is a reiteration of the messiah’s promise of eternal life in the
new spirit world.

    A′te lena ma′qu-we—Ye′ye′ye′!
    A′te lena ma′qu-we—Ye′ye′ye′!
    Peta wañ—yañyañ ma′qu-we—Ye′ye′ye′!
    Peta wañ—yañyañ ma′qu-we—Ye′ye′ye′!
    A′te ma′qu-we—Ye′ye′ye′!
    A′te ma′qu-we—Ye′ye′ye′!

                             _Translation_

    It was the father who gave us these things—_Ye′ye′ye′!_
    It was the father who gave us these things—_Ye′ye′ye′!_
    It was the father who gave us fire—_Ye′ye′ye′!_
    It was the father who gave us fire—_Ye′ye′ye′!_
    The father gave it to us—_Ye′ye′ye′!_
    The father gave it to us—_Ye′ye′ye′!_

This was frequently used as the opening song of the Sioux Ghost
dance. Fire is held in reverence among all Indian tribes as one of
the greatest gifts of the Author of Life, and every tribe has a myth
telling how it originated and how it was obtained by the people. In
most of these myths the fire is represented as being at first in the
possession of some giant or malevolent monster, from whom it is finally
stolen by a hero, after a series of trials and difficulties worthy of
the heroes of the Golden Fleece.


                          15. +Ina′ he′kuwo′+

    Ina′ he′kuwo′; ina′ he′kuwo′.
    Misu′nkala che′yaya oma′ni-ye,
    Misu′nkala che′yaya oma′ni-ye.
    I′na he′kuwo′; i′na he′kuwo′.

                             _Translation_

    Mother, come home; mother, come home.
    My little brother goes about always crying,
    My little brother goes about always crying.
    Mother, come home; mother, come home.

This touching song was a favorite among the Sioux. It was composed by a
young woman who saw her dead mother in the other world, and on waking
out of her trance vision implores the mother to come back to them
again, as her little brother is forever crying after her.


                       16. +Wa′na wanasa′pi-kta+

    Wa′na wanasa′pi-kta,
    Wa′na wanasa′pi-kta.
    Ŭñchi′ ita′zipa michu′-ye,
    Ŭñchi′ ita′zipa michu′-ye,
    A′te he′ye lo, a′te he′ye lo.

                             _Translation_

    Now they are about to chase the buffalo,
    Now they are about to chase the buffalo,
    Grandmother, give me back my bow,
    Grandmother, give me back my bow,
    The father says so, the father says so.

The author of this song, in his trance vision of the spirit world, sees
his old-time friends about to start on a buffalo hunt, and calls to his
grandmother to give him back his bow, so that he may join them. The
form, “give it back to me,” is intended to show how far remote is the
old life of the Indians, before they used the guns and other things
of the white man. The last line has no particular connection with the
rest, except as a common refrain of the ghost songs.


                   17. +He′! kii′ñyañka a′gali′-ye+

    He′! kii′ñyañka a′gali′-ye,
    He′! kii′ñyañka a′gali′-ye,
    Wañ! le′chiya wanasa′pi-kta′ keya′pi lo,
    Wañ! le′chiya wanasa′pi-kta′ keya′pi lo,
    Wañhi′nkpe ka′gha-yo!
    Wañhi′nkpe ka′gha-yo!
    A′te he′ye lo, A′te he′ye lo.

                             _Translation_

    _He!_ They have come back racing,
    _He!_ They have come back racing,
    Why, they say there is to be a buffalo hunt over here,
    Why, they say there is to be a buffalo hunt over here,
    Make arrows! Make arrows!
    Says the father, says the father.

This song may be considered supplementary to the last. In the old
times, when going on a buffalo hunt, it was customary among the Sioux
to send out a small advance party to locate the herd. On finding it,
these men at once returned at full gallop to the main body of hunters,
but instead of stopping on reaching them they dashed past and then
turned and fell in behind. It is to this custom that the first line
refers. The author of the song, on waking up in the spirit world, sees
the scouting party just dashing in with the news of the presence of the
buffalo. Everyone at once prepares to join the hunt and “the father”
commands him to make (or get ready) his arrows and go with them.


                      18. +Mi′ye wañma′yañka-yo+

    Mi′ye wañma′yañka-yo!
    Mi′ye wañma′yañka-yo!
    Ka′ñghi oya′te wañ chañku′ waka′ghe lo,
    Ka′ñghi oya′te wañ chañku′ waka′ghe lo,
    Yani′pi-kta′-cha, yani′pi-kta′-cha.
    Kola he′ye lo, kola he′ye lo.

                             _Translation_

    Look at me! Look at me!
    I make a road for one of the Crow nation (?),
    I make a road for one of the Crow nation (?).
    You shall live indeed, you shall live indeed.
    Our friend says so, our friend says so.

The idea of this song is somewhat similar to that of number 8. It has
no reference to the Crow Indians. As has been already explained, the
crow is symbolic of the spirit world, and when the “friend”—the father
or messiah—declares that he makes a road for one of the Crow nation he
means that he has prepared the way for the return of their friends who
are gone before.


                       19. +Maka′ sito′maniyañ+

    Maka′ sito′maniyañ ukiye,
    Oya′te uki′ye, oya′te uki′ye,
    Wa′ñbali oya′te wañ hoshi′hi-ye lo,
    Ate heye lo, ate heye lo,
    Maka o′wañcha′ya uki′ye.
    Pte kiñ ukiye, pte kiñ ukiye,
    Kañghi oya′te wañ hoshi′hi-ye lo,
    A′te he′ye lo, a′te he′ye lo.

                             _Translation_

    The whole world is coming,
    A nation is coming, a nation is coming,
    The Eagle has brought the message to the tribe.
    The father says so, the father says so.
    Over the whole earth they are coming.
    The buffalo are coming, the buffalo are coming,
    The Crow has brought the message to the tribe,
    The father says so, the father says so.

This fine song summarizes the whole hope of the Ghost dance—the return
of the buffalo and the departed dead, the message being brought to the
people by the sacred birds, the Eagle and the Crow. The eagle known as
_wañ′bali_ is the war eagle, from which feathers are procured for war
bonnets.


                          20. +Le′na wa′kañ+

    Le′na wa′kañ waka′gha-che,
    A′te he′ye lo, a′te he′ye lo,
    O′găle kiñhañ wakañ waka′gha-che,
    A′te he′ye lo, a′te he′ye lo,
    Chănoñ′pa kiñ waka′gha-che,
    A′te he′ye lo, a′te he′ye lo.

                             _Translation_

    It is I who make these sacred things,
    Says the father, says the father.
    It is I who make the sacred shirt,
    Says the father, says the father.
    It is I who made the pipe,
    Says the father, says the father.

This song refers to the sacred pipe (see Sioux song 2 and Arapaho song
2) and the ghost shirt.


                    21. +Miyo′qañ kiñ chichu′-che+

    Miyo′qañ kiñ chichu′-che,
    A′te he′ye lo′, a′te he′ye lo′,
    O′găle kiñ ni′niye′-kta,
    A′te he′ye lo′, a′te he′ye lo′.

                             _Translation_

    Verily, I have given you my strength,
    Says the father, says the father.
    The shirt will cause you to live,
    Says the father, says the father.

This song also refers to the ghost shirt, which was supposed to make
the wearer invulnerable.


                       22. +Michĭ′nkshi tahe′na+

    Michĭ′nkshi tahe′na ku′piye,
    Michĭ′nkshi tahe′na ku′piye,
    Mako′che wañ washte aya′găli′pi-kte,
    A′te he′ye lo′, a′te he′ye lo′.

                             _Translation_

    My child, come this way,
    My child, come this way.
    You will take home with you a good country,
    Says the father, says the father.

This song may refer to the vision of the new earth, which the messiah
showed to the Sioux delegates when they visited him. (See page 797.)
The first line means literally “return in this direction,” the
imperative form used being between a command and an entreaty.


                         23. +Wana wichĕ′shka+

    Wana wichĕ′shka a′ti-ye,
    Wana wichĕ′shka a′ti-ye.
    Wihu′ta oho′măni, wihu′ta oho′măni,
    Oka′tañna, oka′tañna,
    Koyañ wowa′hiñ-kte,
    Koyañ wowa′hiñ-kte.

                             _Translation_

    Now set up the tipi,
    Now set up the tipi.
    Around the bottom,
    Around the bottom,
    Drive in the pegs,
    Drive in the pegs.
    In the meantime I shall cook,
    In the meantime I shall cook.

The form of the verb _oka′tañna_ shows that it is a woman speaking,
even if we did not learn this from the context. To those who know the
Indian life it brings up a vivid picture of a prairie band on the
march, halting at noon or in the evening. As soon as the halt is called
by some convenient stream, the women jump down and release the horses
from the wagons (or the travois in the old times, and hobble them to
prevent them wandering away. Then, while some of the women set up the
tipi poles, draw the canvas over them, and drive in the pegs around
the bottom and the wooden pins up the side, other women take axes and
buckets and go down to the creek for wood and water. When they return,
they find the tipis set up and the blankets spread out upon the grass,
and in a few minutes fires are built and the meal is in preparation.
The woman who composed the song evidently in her vision accompanied her
former friends on such a march.


                          24. +A′te mi′chuye+

    A′te mi′chuye,
    A′te mi′chuye,
    Wañhi′nkpe mi′chuye,
    Wañhi′nkpe mi′chuye,
    A′hiye, a′hiye.
    Wa′sna wa′tiñkte,
    Wa′sna wa′tiñkte.

                             _Translation_

    Father, give them to me,
    Father, give them to me,
    Give me my arrows,
    Give me my arrows.
    They have come, they have come.
    I shall eat pemmican,
    I shall eat pemmican.

The maker of this song, while in the spirit world, asks and receives
from the Father some of the old-time arrows with which to kill buffalo,
so that he may once more feast upon pemmican.


                         25. +Hañpa wecha′ghe+

    Hañpa wecha′ghe,
    Hañpa wecha′ghe,

    Tewa′qila-la he.
    Wa′ñbleni′chala he kaye lo,
    Wa′ñbleni′chala he kaye lo,
    Toke′cha wa′ñwegalaki′ñ-kte,
    Toke′cha wa′ñwegalaki′ñ-kte,
    Nihu′ñ koñ he he′ye lo,
    Nihu′ñ koñ he he′ye lo.

                             _Translation_

    I made moccasins for him,
    I made moccasins for him,
    For I love him,
    For I love him.
    To take to the orphan,
    To take to the orphan.

    Soon I shall see my child,
    Soon I shall see my child,
    Says your mother,
    Says your mother.

This song evidently relates the trance vision of a mother who saw her
child in the spirit world, and expresses the hope that she may soon be
reunited with him. In accordance with the custom of the Ghost dance,
it is probable that she made a pair of moccasins to give him when next
they met, and that she carried them in the dance as she sang.


                     26. +Waka′ñyañ iñya′ñkiñ-kte+

    Waka′ñyañ iñya′nkiñ-kte,
    Waka′ñyañ iñya′nkiñ-kte,
    Chañgăle′shka wañ luza′hañ iñya′ñkiñ-kte,
    Chañgăle′shka wañ luza′hañ iñya′ñkiñ-kte,
    Wañwa′yag upo, wañwa′yag upo,
    A′te he′ye lo, a′te he′ye lo.

                             _Translation_

    The holy (hoop) shall run,
    The holy (hoop) shall run,
    The swift hoop shall run,
    The swift hoop shall run.
    Come and see it,
    Come and see it,
    Says the father,
    Says the father.

This song refers to the game wheel and sticks (_bä′qati_, Arapaho)
already described in the Arapaho songs. It is said that the
medicine-man of Big Foot’s band carried such a hoop with him in their
flight from the north, and displayed it in every dance held by the band
until the fatal day of Wounded Knee. A similar hoop was carried and
hung upon the center tree at the dance at No Water’s camp near Pine
Ridge. To the Indian it symbolizes the revival of the old-time games.

                           KIOWA TRIBAL SIGN

The Kiowa tribal sign indicates “hair cut off at right ear,” in
allusion to a former custom of the warriors. From a careless habit in
making this sign it has sometimes been wrongly interpreted to mean
“foolish,” or “rattle-brain.”


                          SKETCH OF THE KIOWA

So far as present knowledge goes, the Kiowa constitute a distinct
linguistic stock; but it is probable that more material will enable
us to prove their connection with some tribes farther north, from
which direction they came. They are noticed in the Spanish records as
early at least as 1732. Their oldest tradition, which agrees with the
concurrent testimony of the Shoshoni and Arapaho, locates them about
the junction of Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin forks, at the extreme
head of Missouri river, in the neighborhood of the present Virginia
City, Montana. They afterward moved down from the mountains and formed
an alliance with the Crow, with whom they have since continued on
friendly terms. From here they drifted southward along the base of
the mountains, driven by the Cheyenne and Arapaho. About 1840 they
made peace with the latter tribes, with which they have since commonly
acted in concert. The Sioux claim to have driven them out of the Black
hills, and in 1805 they were reported as living upon the North Platte.
According to the Kiowa account, when they first reached Arkansas river
they found their passage opposed by the Comanche, who claimed all the
country to the south. A war followed, but peace was finally concluded,
when the Kiowa crossed over to the south side of the Arkansas and
formed a confederation with the Comanche, which continues to the
present day. In connection with the Comanche they carried on a constant
war upon the frontier settlements of Mexico and Texas, extending their
incursions as far south at least as Durango. Among all the prairie
tribes they were noted as the most predatory and bloodthirsty, and have
probably killed more white men in proportion to their numbers than
any of the others. They made their first treaty with the government
in 1837, and were put upon their present reservation jointly with the
Comanche and Apache in 1868. Their last outbreak was in 1874–75, in
connection with the Comanche, Apache, and Cheyenne. While probably
never very numerous, they have been greatly reduced by war and disease.
Their last terrible blow came in the spring of 1892, when the measles
destroyed over 300 of the three confederated tribes. Their present
chief is _Gu′i-pä′go_, Lone Wolf. They occupy the same reservation
with the Comanche and Apache, between Washita and Red rivers, in
southwestern Oklahoma, and numbered 1,017 in 1893.

The Kiowa do not have the gentile system, and there is no restriction
as to intermarriage among the divisions. They have six tribal
divisions, including the Apache associated with them, who form a
component part of the Kiowa camping circle. A seventh division, the
_K̔uăto_, is now extinct. The tribal divisions in the order of the
camping circle are:

1. _K̔a′ta_—“biters,” i. e., Arikara or Ree; so called, not because of
Arikara origin, but because they were more intimate with that tribe in
trade and otherwise when the Kiowa lived in the north.

2. _Ko′‛gu′i_—“elks.”

3. _Kâ′igwŭ_—“Kiowa proper.” This is the oldest division, to which
belongs the keeping of the medicine tipi, in which is the grand
medicine of the tribe.

4. _Kiñep_—“big shields.” This is the largest division in the tribe and
of corresponding importance.

5. _Semät_—“thieves,” the Apache.

6. _Koñtä′lyui_—“black boys.” Sometimes also called _Si′ndiyu′i_,
“Sindi’s children.” Said to be of darker color than the rest of the
tribe, which, if true, might indicate a foreign origin. Sindi is the
great mythic hero of the Kiowa.

7. _K̔u′ato_—“pulling up from the ground or a hole.” An extinct
division, speaking a slightly different dialect, and exterminated
by the Sioux in one battle about the year 1780. On this occasion,
according to tradition, the Kiowa were attacked by an overwhelming
force of Sioux and prepared to retreat, but the chief of the K̔uato
exhorted his people not to run, “because, if they did, their relatives
in the other world would not receive them.” So they stood their ground
and were killed, while the others escaped. Their place in the tribal
camp circle is not known.

[Illustration: +Fig. 104+—Kiowa camping circle.]

In the annual sun dance and in other great tribal gatherings the
several divisions camped in the order shown in figure 104.

Although brave and warlike, the Kiowa are considered inferior in most
respects to the Comanche. In person they are dark and heavily built,
forming a marked contrast to the more slender and brighter-complexioned
prairie tribes farther north. Their language is full of choking and
nasal sounds, and is not well adapted to rhythmic composition, for
which reason they frequently used the Arapaho songs in the Ghost
dance, without any clear idea of the meaning or correct pronunciation,
although they have quite a number of songs of their own.


                           THE KIOWA APACHE

A small tribe of Athapascan stock, calling themselves _Na′-isha_ or
_Na-di′isha-de′na_, and popularly known as Apache or Kiowa Apache,
has been associated with the Kiowa as far back as the traditions of
either tribe go. While retaining their distinct language, they nearly
all speak and understand Kiowa and form a component part of the Kiowa
camping circle. In dress and general habits of life they are in no way
distinguishable. They have come from the north with the Kiowa, and
are mentioned under the name of Cataka as living in the Black-hills
country in 1805. La Salle speaks of them under the name of Gattacka as
early as 1681. There is no reason to suppose that they ever formed a
part of the Apache proper of Arizona and New Mexico, but are probably,
like the Sarsi, a distinct Athapascan people who have always lived
east of the mountains, and who, having been obliged by weakness of
numbers to unite themselves with a stronger tribe, have since shared
their migratory fortunes southward along the plains. The Na-isha are
called _Ga′taqka_ by the Pawnee and sometimes by the Wichita; _Cataka_
by Lewis and Clark, in 1805; _Kataka_ in their first treaty with the
government, made jointly with the Kiowa in 1837; _Ta′shĭn_ by the
Comanche; _Gĭnä′s_ by the Wichita; _Ka′ntsi_, “deceivers,” by the
Caddo; _Kĭri′năhĭs_ by the Kichais; _Tha‛kahinĕ′na_, “knife-whetting
men (?)” by the Arapaho, and _Mûtsiănătä′niuw′_, “whetstone people,”
by the Cheyenne. They have several names among the Kiowa, but are
commonly known by them as _Semät_, “thieves.” Other Kiowa names for
them are _Tagu′i_, of unknown meaning, and _Sa′dălso′mte-k̔iñago_,
“weasel people.” The tribal sign for them, as for the Apache, Lipan,
and Navaho, conveys the idea of “knife whetters.” In 1891 they numbered
325. In 1893 they had been reduced, chiefly by an epidemic of measles,
to 224.

More extended information in regard to the Kiowa and Kiowa Apache
will be given in the author’s memoir, “Calendar History of the Kiowa
Indians,” now in preparation for the Bureau of Ethnology.


                          SONGS OF THE KIOWA


                         1. +Da′ta-i so′da′te+

    Da′ta-i so′da′te,
    Da′ta-i so′da′te.
    Do′m ezä′nteda′te,
    Do′m ezä′nteda′te.
    De′ĭmhä′date,
    De′ĭmhä′date.
    Be′a‛ma′nhäyi′,
    Be′a‛ma′nhäyi′.

                             _Translation_

    The father will descend,
    The father will descend.
    The earth will tremble,
    The earth will tremble.
    Everybody will arise,
    Everybody will arise.
    Stretch out your hands,
    Stretch out your hands.

This is a summary of the Ghost dance doctrine, closing with an
invocation to all present to stretch out their hands toward the west
and pray to the Father to hasten his coming.


                  2. +Da′k̔′ñago (ĭm) zä′nteähe′dal+

    Da′k̔i′ñago (ĭm) zä′nteähe′dal,
    Da′k̔i′ñago (ĭm) zä′nteähe′dal,
    De′dom ezä′nteähe′dal,
    De′dom ezä′nteähe′dal.
    De′ĭmgo (ä-)dä′tode′yo′,
    De′ĭmgo (ä-)dä′tode′yo′.
    De′beko′datsä′,
    De′beko′datsä′.

                             _Translation_

    The spirit army is approaching,
    The spirit army is approaching,
    The whole world is moving onward,
    The whole world is moving onward.
    See! Everybody is standing watching,
    See! Everybody is standing watching.
    Let us all pray,
    Let us all pray.

In this song the verb _ĭmzä′nteähe′dal_ implies that the spirits are
coming on like an army or like a great herd of animals. The termination
_he′dal_ implies that it is a matter of report or common belief and not
of personal knowledge.


                          3. +Gu′ato ädâ′ga+

    Gu′ato ädâ′ga nyä′ongu′m,
    Gu′ato ädâ′ga nyä′ongu′m,
    Go′mtäyä′ ätso′dalsâ′dal,
    Go′mtäyä′ ätso′dalsâ′dal.
    Ä′nyä‛gâlo′nte,
    Ä′nyä‛gâlo′nte.
    Tä′lyi ĭmhä′go,
    Tä′lyi ĭmhä′go.

                             _Translation_

    I scream because I am a bird,
    I scream because I am a bird,
    I bellow like a buffalo,
    I bellow like a buffalo.
    The boy will rise up,
    The boy will rise up.

This song was composed by Pa-guadal, “Red Buffalo,” at a Ghost dance
held on Walnut creek in the summer of 1893, under the direction of
the prophet Pa-iñgya (see page 907), for the purpose of resurrecting
Red Buffalo’s son, who had recently died. Pa-iñgya assured the people
that if they held the dance as he directed, the dead boy would rise
up alive from the ground before their eyes. In the dance Red Buffalo
became “crazy” and composed this song. In his trance he evidently
imagined himself a bird. His father was one of the “buffalo doctors,”
or surgeons of the tribe, who are under the special protection of the
buffalo and whose war cry is an imitation of the bellowing of a buffalo
bull. Red Buffalo claims to have inherited his father’s knowledge;
hence his assertion that he bellows like a bull. The boy was not
resurrected.


                      4. +Da′ta-i nyä′hoănga′mo+

    Ä′häyä′ Ehä′eho′! Ä′häyä′ Ehä′eho′!
    E′häyä′ Ehä′eho′! E′häyä′ Ehä′eho′!
    Da′ta-i nyä′hoănga′mo,
    Da′ta-i nyä′hoănga′mo.
    Äde′tepo′nbä,
    Äde′tepo′nbä,
    Ä′guănpo′nbä,
    Ä′guănpo′nbä.

                             _Translation_

    _Ä′häyä′ Ehä′eho′! Ä′häyä′ Ehä′eho′!
    E′häyä′ Ehä′eho′! E′häyä′ Ehä′eho′!_
    The father shows me the road,
    The father shows me the road.
    I went to see my friends,
    I went to see my friends,
    I went to see the dances,
    I went to see the dances.

The composer of this song went, in her trance, to the other world,
led by the Father, who pointed out the way, and saw there her former
friends and joined them in the dance.


                         5. +Dak̔iñ′a bate′yä+

    Dak̔iñ′a bate′yä,
    Dak̔iñ′a bate′yä.
    Guăto ton nyäâmo,
    Guăto ton nyäâ′mo.
    Ähiñ′äih nyäâ′mo,
    Ähiñ′äih nyäâ′mo.

                             _Translation_

    The spirit (God) is approaching,
    The spirit (God) is approaching.
    He is going to give me a bird tail,
    He is going to give me a bird tail.
    He will give it to me in the tops of the cottonwoods,
    He will give it to me in the tops of the cottonwoods.

The “bird tail” refers to the feathers (_wakuna_, Arapaho) worn on the
heads of the dancers (figure 91). The song is peculiar in implying that
the recipient must climb up into the tree tops to obtain it.


                          6. +Na′da′g äka′na+

    Heyĕ′heyĕ′heyĕ′heye′ Äho′ho′!
    Heyĕ′heyĕ′heyĕ′heye′ Äho′ho′!
    Na′da′g äka′na,
    Na′da′g äka′na,
    De′gyägo′mga da′tsä′to,
    De′gyägo′mga da′tsä′to.
    Äo′ñyo, Äo′ñyo.

                             _Translation_

    _Heyĕ′heyĕ′heyĕ′heye′ Äho′ho′!
    Heyĕ′heyĕ′heyĕ′heye′ Äho′ho′!_
    Because I am poor,
    Because I am poor,
    I pray for every living creature,
    I pray for every living creature.
    _Äo′ñyo! Äo′ñyo!_

Although the words of this song do not contain much meaning, the tune
is one of the best among the Kiowa ghost songs. The introductory line
gives somewhat the effect of Comanche song 1. The last line is supposed
to be a prayer or entreaty to the messiah, and is an imitation of the
Kiowa funeral wail.


                   7. +Ze′bät-gâ′ga igu′ănpa′-ima′+

    Ze′bät-gâ′ga igu′ănpa′-ima′,
    Ze′bät-gâ′ga igu′ănpa′-ima′.
    Bälä′gâ na′ta′dălgo′ma,
    Bälä′gâ na′ta′dălgo′ma.
    Tä′lyiă be′`pe′te,
    Tä′lyiă be′`pe′te.

                             _Translation_

    He makes me dance with arrows,
    He makes me dance with arrows.
    He calls the bow my father,

    He calls the bow my father.
    Grandmother, persevere,
    Grandmother, persevere.

This song embodies the Ghost-dance idea of a return to the old Indian
things. The expression, “He calls the bow my father,” is worthy of an
oriental poet. The last line is a general exhortation to the women to
persevere or “push hard” in the dance.


                      8. +Be′ta! To′ngyä-gu′adăl+

    Be′ta! To′ngyä-gu′adăl äto′tl-e′dal,
    Be′ta! To′ngyä-gu′adăl äto′tl-e′dal.
    Bä′ate′ñyi, Bä′ate′ñyi.
    Da′te gyäko′m ä′omhe′dăl,
    Da′te gyäko′m ä′omhe′dăl.

                             _Translation_

    Now I understand! Red Tail has been sent,
    Now I understand! Red Tail has been sent.
    We cry and hold fast to him,
    We cry and hold fast to him.
    He was made to live a long time,
    He was made to live a long time.

This song was made by Mary Zoñtom, a woman who speaks very fair
English, and refers to a young man named _To′ngyä-gu′adal_, Red Tail,
who used to go into frequent trances. The expression “he was sent”
implies that he is a recognized messenger to the spirit world, while
“we hold fast to him” is equivalent to “we have faith in him.”


                       9. +Da′ta′-i änka′ñgo′na+

    Da′ta′-i änka′ñgo′na,
    Da′ta′-i änka′ñgo′na.
    Da′mânhä′go, Da′mânhä′go.
    Ka′ante damânhä′go,

                             _Translation_

    My father has much pity for us,
    My father has much pity for us.
    I hold out my hands toward him and cry,
    I hold out my hands toward him and cry.
    In my poverty I hold out my hands toward him and cry,
    In my poverty I hold out my hands toward him and cry.


                     10. +Da′ta-i iñka′ñtähe′dal+

    Ähä′yä Ehä′eho′,
    Ähä′yä Ehä′eho′.

    Ä‛da′ta′-i o′mda.

                             _Translation_

    _Ähä′yä Ehä′eho′,
    Ähä′yä Ehä′eho′._
    My father has had pity on me.
    I have eyes like my father’s,
    I have hands like my father’s,
    I have legs like my father’s,
    I have a form like my father’s.

“So God created man in his own image.”


                     11. +Dak`iñ′ago äho′ähe′dal+

    Dak`iñ′ago äho′ähe′dal,

    I am mashing the berries,
    I am mashing the berries.
    They say travelers are coming on the march,

    I stir (the berries) around, I stir them around;

    I take them up with a spoon of buffalo horn,
    And I carry them, I carry them (to the strangers),
    And I carry them, I carry them (to the strangers).

This song gives a pretty picture of the old Indian home life and
hospitality. In her dream the woman who composed it imagines herself
cooking fruit, when the word comes that travelers are approaching, the
verb implying that they are on the march with their children, dogs,
and household property. She stirs the berries around a few times more,
lifts them out with a spoon of buffalo horn, and goes to offer them to
the strangers. The translation is an exact paraphrase of the rhythmic
repetition of the original. The berry called _eyhuñ′i_, “principal or
best fruit,” is not found in the present country of the Kiowa, but is
remembered among the pleasant things of their old home in the north. It
is described as a species of cherry.


                          13. +Go′mgyä-da′ga+

    That wind, that wind
    Shakes my tipi, shakes my tipi,
    And sings a song for me,
    And sings a song for me.

To the familiar this little song brings up pleasant memories of the
prairie camp when the wind is whistling through the tipi poles and
blowing the flaps about, while inside the fire burns bright and the
song and the game go round.


                     14. +Dak̔iñ′a daka′ñtähe′dal+

                          SKETCH OF THE CADDO

The Caddo are the principal southern representatives of the Caddoan
stock, which includes also the Wichita, Kichai, Pawnee, and Arikara.
Their confederacy consisted of about a dozen tribes or divisions,
claiming as their original territory the whole of lower Red river and
adjacent country in Louisiana, eastern Texas, and southern Arkansas.
The names of these twelve divisions, including two of foreign origin,
have been preserved as follows:

_Kä′dohadä′cho_ (Caddo proper).

_Nädä′ko_ (Anadarko).

_Hai′-nai_ (Toni).

_Nä′bai-dä′cho_ (Nabedache).

_Nä′kohodo′tsi_ (Nacogdoches).

_Näshi′tosh_ (Natchitoches).

_Nä′ka‛na′wan._

_Hădai′-i_ (Adai, Adaize).

_Hai′-ĭsh_ (Eyeish, Aliche, Aes).

_Yä′tăsi._

_I′măha_—a band of Omaha, or perhaps more probably Kwâpâ, who lived
with the Kä′dohadä′cho, but retained their own distinct language.
There are still a few living with the Caddo, but they retain only
the name. It will be remembered that when the Caddo lived in eastern
Louisiana the Arkansas or Kwâpâ were their nearest neighbors on the
north, and these Imaha may have been a part of the Kwâpâ who lived “up
stream” (_U′mañhañ_) on the Arkansas. The Caddo call the Omaha tribe by
the same name.

_Yowa′ni_—originally a band of the Heyowani division of the Choctaw.
They joined the Caddo a long time ago, probably about the time the
Choctaw began to retire across the Mississippi before the whites. Some
few are still living with the Caddo and retain their distinct language.
There is evidence that some Koasati (Cooshatties) were mixed with them.

The Kä′dohadä′cho seem to be recognized as the principal Caddo
division, and the generic term _Hasi′nai_ by which the confederates
designate themselves is sometimes regarded as belonging more properly
to the three divisions first named. According to their own statements
some of the dialects spoken by the several divisions were mutually
unintelligible. At present the Kädohadächo and Nädäko are the ruling
dialects, while the Näbaidächo, Näkohodotsi, Hădai′-i, and Hai′-ĭsh are
practically extinct. The Kichai, Bidai, and Akokisa, who formerly lived
near the Caddo on the eastern border of Texas, did not belong to the
confederacy, although at least one of these tribes, the Kichai, is of
the same stock and is now on the same reservation.

The Caddo have ten gentes: _Na′wotsi_, Bear; _Tasha_, Wolf; _Ta′năhă_,
Buffalo; _Ta′o_, Beaver; _Iwi_, Eagle; _Oăt_, Raccoon; _Ka′g‛aih_,
Crow; _Ka′găhănĭn_, Thunder; _Kĭshi_, Panther; _Sûko_, Sun. The Bear
gens is the most numerous. The Buffalo gens is sometimes called also
_Koho′_ or Alligator, because both animals bellow in the same way.
These of a particular gens will not kill the animal from which the gens
takes its name, and no Caddo in the old times would kill either an
eagle or a panther, although they were not afraid to kill the bear, as
are so many of the western tribes. The eagle might be killed, however,
for its feathers by a hunter regularly initiated and consecrated for
that purpose.

The original home of the Caddo was on lower Red river in Louisiana.
According to their own tradition, which has parallels among several
other tribes, they came up from under the ground through the mouth of a
cave in a hill which they call _Cha′‛kanĭ′nă_, “The place of crying,”
on a lake close to the south bank of Red river, just at its junction
with the Mississippi. In those days men and animals were all brothers
and all lived together under the ground. But at last they discovered
the entrance to the cave leading up to the surface of the earth, and
so they decided to ascend and come out. First an old man climbed up,
carrying in one hand fire and a pipe and in the other a drum. After
him came his wife, with corn and pumpkin seeds. Then followed the rest
of the people and the animals. All intended to come out, but as soon
as the wolf had climbed up he closed the hole, and shut up the rest
of the people and animals under the ground, where they still remain.
Those who had come out sat down and cried a long time for their friends
below, hence the name of the place. Because the Caddo came out of the
ground they call it _ină′_, mother, and go back to it when they die.
Because they have had the pipe and the drum and the corn and pumpkins
since they have been a people, they hold fast to these things and have
never thrown them away.

From this place they spread out toward the west, following up the
course of Red river, along which they made their principal settlements.
For a long time they lived on Caddo lake, on the boundary between
Louisiana and Texas, their principal village on the lake being called
Sha′chidĭ′ni, “Timber hill.” Their acquaintance with the whites began
at a very early period. One of their tribes, the Nädäko, is mentioned
under the name of Nandacao in the narrative of De Soto’s expedition
as early as 1540. The Kädohadächo were known to the French as early
as 1687. The relations of the Caddo with the French and Spaniards
were intimate and friendly. Catholic missions were established among
them, about the year 1700 and continued to exist until 1812, when the
missions were suppressed by the Spanish government and the Indians were
scattered. In the meantime Louisiana had been purchased by the United
States, and the Caddo soon began to be pushed away from their ancient
villages into the western territory, where they were exposed to the
constant inroads of the prairie tribes. From this time their decline
was rapid, and the events of the Texan and Mexican wars aided still
further in their demoralization. They made their first treaty with the
United States in 1835, at which time they were chiefly in Louisiana,
southwest of Red river and adjoining Texas. They afterward removed to
Brazos river in Texas, and to Washita river in Indian Territory in
1859. When the rebellion broke out, the Caddo, not wishing to take
up arms against the government, fled north into Kansas and remained
there until the close of the war, when they returned to the Washita.
Their present reservation, which they hold only by executive order and
jointly with the Wichita, lies between Washita and Canadian rivers in
western Oklahoma, having the Cheyenne and Arapaho on the north and west
and the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache on the south. In 1893 they numbered
507.

In person the Caddo are rather smaller and darker than the neighboring
prairie tribes, and from their long residence in Louisiana, they have a
considerable admixture of French blood. They are an agricultural tribe,
raising large crops of corn, pumpkins, and melons, and still retaining
industrious habits in spite of their many vicissitudes of fortune. They
were never buffalo hunters until they came out on the plains. They
formerly lived in conical grass houses like the Wichita, but are now in
log houses and generally wear citizen’s dress excepting in the dance.
The old custom which gave rise to the name and tribal sign of “Pierced
Nose” is now obsolete. In 1806 Sibley said of them, “They are brave,
despise danger or death, and boast that they have never shed white
man’s blood.” Their former enemies, the prairie tribes, bear witness
to their bravery, and their friendship toward the whites is a part of
their history, but has resulted in no great advantage to themselves, as
they have been dispossessed from their own country and are recognized
only as tenants at will in their present location.

They and the Wichita received the new doctrine from the Arapaho, and
were soon among its most earnest adherents, notwithstanding the fact
that they were regarded as the most advanced of all the tribes in that
part of the country. It may be that their history had led them to feel
a special need of a messiah. They have been hard and constant dancers,
at one time even dancing in winter when there was nearly a foot of snow
upon the ground. Their first songs were those which they had heard
from the Arapaho, and sang in corrupted form, with only a general idea
of their meaning, but they now have a number of songs in their own
language, some of which are singularly pleasing in melody and sentiment.


                   THE WICHITA, KICHAI, AND DELAWARE

Closely associated with the Caddo on the same reservation are the
Wichita, with their subtribes, the Tawakoni and Waco, numbering
together 316 in 1893; the Delaware, numbering 94, and the Kichai
(Keechies), numbering only 52. Of these, all but the Delaware, who
are Algonquian, belong to the Caddoan stock. The Wichita and their
subtribes, although retaining in indistinct form the common Caddoan
tradition, claim as their proper home the Wichita mountains, near which
they still remain. Sixty years ago their principal village was on the
north side of the north fork of Red river, a short distance below the
mouth of Elm creek, in Oklahoma. They live in conical grass houses
and, like the other tribes of the stock, are agricultural. They call
themselves _Kĭ′tikĭti′sh_—they are called _Tawe′hash_ by the Caddo and
Kichai—and are known to most of their other neighbors and in the sign
language as the “Tattooed People” (_Do′kănă_, Comanche; _Do‛gu′at_,
Kiowa), from an old custom now nearly obsolete. For the same reason and
from their resemblance to the Pawnee, with whose language their own has
a close connection, the French called them _Pani Pique′s_.

The Kichai or Keechie, or _Ki′tsäsh_, as they call themselves, are a
small tribe of the same stock, and claim to have moved up Red river in
company with the Caddo. Their language is different from that of any of
their neighbors, but approaches the Pawnee.

The Delaware are a small band of the celebrated tribe of that name.
They removed from the east and settled with the main body in Kansas,
but drifted south into Texas while it was still Spanish territory.
After a long series of conflicts with the American settlers of Texas,
before and after the Mexican war, they were finally taken under the
protection of the United States government and assigned to their
present reservation along with other emigrant tribes from that state.


                          SONGS OF THE CADDO


                        1. +Ha′yo tă′ia’ ă′ă′+

“Our mother” here refers to the earth.


                    2. +Wû′nti ha′yano′ di′witi′a+

[Music]

    Nä′nisa′na, nä′nisa′na,
    Wû′nti ha′yano′ di′witi′a ha′yo′,
    Wû′nti ha′yano′ di′witi′a ha′yo′,

    A′ă ko′ia′ ha′yo′,

    All our people are going up,
    All our people are going up,
    Above to where the father dwells,
    Above to where the father dwells,
    Above to where our people live,
    Above to where our people live.


                          3. +Nû′na ĭ′tsiya′+

    He′yawe′ya! He′yawe′ya!
    Nû′na ĭ′tsiya′ si′bocha′ha′,
    Nû′na ĭ′tsiya′ si′bocha′ha′,
    Wû′nti ha′yano′ ha′nĭn gû′kwû′ts-a′,
    Wû′nti ha′yano′ ha′nĭn gû′kwû′ts-a′,
    He′yahe′eye′! He′yahe′eye′!

                             _Translation_

    _He′yawe′ya! He′yawe′ya!_
    I have come because I want to see them,
    I have come because I want to see them,
    The people, all my children,
    The people, all my children.
    _He′yahe′eye! He′yahe′eye!_

This song was composed by a woman named Nyu′taa. According to her
story, she saw in her trance a large company approaching, led by a man
who told her he was the Father and that he was coming because he wished
to see all his children.


                           4. +Na′tsiwa′ya+

    Na′tsiwa′ya, na′tsiwa′ya,
    Na′ ika′—Wi′ahe′e′ye′,
    Na′ ika′—Wi′ahe′e′ye′,
    Wi′ahe′e′ye′ye′yeahe′ye′,
    Wi′ahe′e′ye′ye′yeahe′ye′.

                             _Translation_

    _Wi′ahe′e′ye′ye′yeahe′ye′,
    Wi′ahe′e′ye′ye′yeahe′ye′!_

This song also was composed by the woman Nyu′taa. In her trance vision
she fell asleep and seemed (still in the vision) to be awakened by the
noise of a storm, when she looked and saw approaching her the Storm
Spirit, who said to her, “I come, the grandmother from on high.” The
Caddo call thunder the “grandmother above” and the sun the “uncle
above.”


                     5. +Na′-iye′ ino′ ga′nio′sĭt+

    Wa′hiya′ne, wa′hiya′ne,
    Na′-iye′ ino′ ga′nio′sĭt,
    Na′-iye′ ino′ ga′nio′sĭt.
    Wa′hiya′ne, wa′hiya′ne.

                             _Translation_

    _Wa′hiya′ne, wa′hiya′ne_,
    My sister above, she is painted,
    My sister above, she is painted.
    _Wa′hiya′ne, wa′hiya′ne._

This is another song composed by Nyu′taa, who herself explained it. In
this trance vision she saw a spirit woman painted with blue stripes on
her forehead and a crow on her chin, who told her that she was “her
sister, the Evening Star.” While singing this song Nyu′taa was sitting
near me, when she suddenly cried out and went into a spasm of trembling
and crying lasting some minutes, lifting up her right hand toward the
west at the same time. Such attacks were so common among the women at
song rehearsals as frequently to interfere with the work, although the
bystanders regarded them as a matter of course and took only a passing
notice of these incidents.


                        6. +Na′a ha′yo ha′wano+

    Nä′nisa′na, nä′nisa′na,
    Na′a ha′yo ha′wano,
    Na′a ha′yo ha′wano.

                             _Translation_

    _Nä′nisa′na, nä′nisa′na_,
    Our father above (has) paint,
    Our father above (has) paint.

This refers to the sacred paint used by the participants in the Ghost
dance, and which is believed to confer health and the power to see
visions.


                     7. +Wû′nti ha′yano ka′ka′na′+

    Nänisa′na, nänisa′na,
    Wû′nti ha′yano ka′ka′na′ ni′‛tsiho′,
    Wû′nti ha′yano ka′ka′na′ ni′‛tsiho′,
    Aa′ ko′ia′ ta′-ia′ ha′yo′,
    Aa′ ko′ia′ ta′-ia′ ha′yo′.

                             _Translation_

    _Nä′nisa′na, nänisa′na_,
    All the people cried when I returned,
    All the people cried when I returned,
    Where the father dwells above,
    Where the father dwells above.

This song was composed by a girl who went up to the spirit world and
saw there all her friends, who cried when she started to leave them
again.


                            8. +Na′wi i′na+

    Nä′nisa′na, nä′nisa′na,
    E′yahe′ya, e′yahe′ya, he′e′ye′!
    E′yahe′ya, e′yahe′ya, he′e′ye′!
    Na′wi i′na ha′yo ă′ă—He′yoi′ya, he′e′ye′!

                             _Translation_

    _Nä′nisa′na, nä′nisa′na,
    E′yahe′ya, e′yahe′ya, he′e′ye′!
    E′yahe′ya, e′yahe′ya, he′e′ye′!_
    We have our mother below; we have our father above—_He′yoi′ya, he′e′ye′!_
    We have our mother below; we have our father above—_He′yoi′ya, he′e′ye′!_

This song was composed by a woman named Niaha‛no′, who used to have
frequent trances in which she would talk with departed Caddo and bring
back messages from them to their friends. “Our mother below” is the
earth. (See page 1096.)


                          9. +Ni′ ika′ na′a+

    Ni′ ika′ na′a ha′na′,
    Ni′ ika′ na′a ha′na′;
    Na′a-a′ ha′na′,
    Na′a-a′ ha′na′.

                             _Translation_

    There are our grandmother and our father above,
    There are our grandmother and our father above;
    There is our father above,
    There is our father above.

By “grandmother” is meant the storm spirit or thunder. (See Caddo song
4.)


                       10. +Hi′na ha′natobi′na+

    Hi′na ha′natobi′na i′wi-na′,
    Hi′na ha′natobi′na i′wi-na′,

    Na′ iwi′ i′wi-na′;
    Na′nana′ ha′taha′,
    Na′nana′ ha′taha′.

                             _Translation_

    The eagle feather headdress from above,
    The eagle feather headdress from above,
    From the eagle above, from the eagle above;
    It is that feather we wear,
    It is that feather we wear.

This refers to the eagle feather worn on the heads of the dancers. (See
song number 12.) This song is in the Hai-nai dialect.


                        11. +Na′ ăă′ o′wi′ta′+

    Na′ ăă′ o′wi′ta′,
    Na′ ăă′ o′wi′ta′,
    Na′ kiwa′t Hai′-nai′,
    Na′ kiwa′t Hai′-nai′.

                             _Translation_

    The father comes from above,
    The father comes from above,
    From the home of the Hai-nai above,
    From the home of the Hai-nai above.

This song, like the last, was composed by one of the Hai-nai tribe, and
refers to the silent majority of the band in the spirit world.


                        12. +Na′ iwi′ o′wi′ta′+

[Music]

    Na′ iwi′ o′wi′ta′,
    Na′ iwi′ o′wi′ta′;

    Do′hya di′wabo′n na′ na′ iwi′ o′wi′ta′;
    Na′ha′ na′daka′a′, Na′ha′ na′daka′a′.

                             _Translation_

    See! the eagle comes,
    See! the eagle comes;
    Now at last we see him—look! look! the eagle comes,
    Now at last we see him—look! look! the eagle comes;
    Now we see him with the people,
    Now we see him with the people.

This refers to what the Caddo call the “return of the eagle feathers”
in the Ghost dance. With the Caddo, as with other tribes, the eagle
is a sacred bird, and in the old times only the few medicine-men who
knew the sacred formula would dare to kill one for the feathers. Should
anyone else kill an eagle, his family would die or some other great
misfortune would come upon him. The formula consisted of certain secret
prayers and ritual performances. Among the Cherokee the eagle killer’s
prayer was a petition to the eagle not to be revenged upon the tribe,
because it was not an Indian, but a Spaniard, who had killed him—an
indication of the vivid remembrance in which the cruelty of the early
Spaniards was held among the southern tribes. To further guard against
the anger of the eagles, the Cherokee eagle killer, on his return
to the village, announced that he had killed, not an eagle, but a
snowbird, the latter being too small and insignificant to be dreaded.
The eagle-killing ceremony among the northern prairie tribes has
been already described under Arapaho song 47. The Caddo eagle killer
always took with him a robe or some other valuable offering, and after
shooting the eagle, making the prayer, and pulling out the tail and
wing feathers he covered the body with the robe and left it there as
a peace offering to the spirit of the eagle. The dead eagle was never
brought home, as among the Cherokee. The last man of the Caddo who
knew the eagle-killing ritual died some years ago, and since then they
have had to go without eagle feathers or buy them from the Kiowa and
other tribes. Since Sitting Bull came down and “gave the feather” to
the leaders of the dance the prohibition is removed, and men and women
alike are now at liberty to get and wear eagle feathers as they will.


                       13. +A′nana′ hana′nito′+

    A′nana′ hana′nito′ ni′ahu′na—_He′e′ye′!_
    A′nana′ hana′nito′ ni′ahu′na—_He′e′ye′!_
    A′nana′sa′na′? A′nana′sa′na′?
    Ha′yo ha′nitu′ ni′ahu′na—_He′e′ye′!_
    Ha′yo ha′nitu′ ni′ahu′na—_He′e′ye′!_
    A′nana′sa′na′? A′ana′sa′na′?

                             _Translation_

    The feather has come back from above—_He′e′ye′!_
    The feather has come back from above—_He′e′ye′!_
    Is he doing it? Is he doing it?
    The feather has returned from on high—_He′e′ye′!_
    The feather has returned from on high—_He′e′ye′!_
    Is he doing it? Is he doing it?

This refers to the return of the eagle feathers, as noted in the
preceding song. The question “Is he doing it?” is equivalent to
asking, “Is this the work of the father?”—an affirmative answer being
understood.


                        14. +Na′ iwi′ ha′naa′+

    Na′ iwi′ ha′naa′,
    Na′ iwi′ ha′naa′;
    Wû′nti ha′yano′ na′nia′sana′,
    Wû′nti ha′yano′ na′nia′sana′.
    Na′ha na′ni′asa′,
    Na′ha na′ni′asa′.

                             _Translation_

    There is an eagle above,
    There is an eagle above;
    All the people are using it,
    All the people are using it.
    See! They use it,
    See! They use it.

This song also refers to the use of eagle feathers in the dance.


                         15. +Wi′tŭ′ Ha′sini′+

[Music]

    E′yehe′! Nä′nisa′na,
    E′yehe′! Nä′nisa′na.
    Wi′tŭ′ Ha′sini′ di′witi′a′a′,
    Wi′tŭ′ Ha′sini′ di′witi′a′a′.
    Ki′wat ha′-ime′—He′e′ye′!
    Ki′wat ha′-ime′—He′e′ye′!
    Na′hayo′ na′,
    Na′hayo′ na′ă′ă′ ko′iă′—He′e′ye′!
    I′na ko′iă′—He′e′ye′!
    I′na ko′iă′—He′e′ye′!

                             _Translation_

    _E′yehe′! Nä′nisa′na,
    E′yehe′! Nä′nisa′na._
    Come on, Caddo, we are all going up,
    Come on, Caddo, we are all going up.
    To the great village—_He′e′ye′!_
    To the great village—_He′e′ye′!_
    With our father above,
    With our father above where he dwells on high—_He′e′ye′!_
    Where our mother dwells—_He′e′ye′!_
    Where our mother dwells—_He′e′ye′!_

The sentiment and swinging tune of this spirited song make it one
of the favorites. It encourages the dancers in the hope of a speedy
reunion of the whole Caddo nation, living and dead, in the “great
village” of their father above, and needs no further explanation.

                                ERRATUM


From a letter of Judge James Wickersham, already quoted as an authority
on the Shaker religion of the Columbia River tribes, it appears that
Aiyal is not the same individual as Yowaluch, as was stated by our
Yakima informants, who were doubtless deceived by the resemblance of
sound. Judge Wickersham writes: “I know this man Aiyal, and he and
Yowaluch, while great friends, are not the same person. Aiyal is a
Cowlitz, and was sent by Yowaluch to the Yakima, together with John W.
Simmons, to convert that tribe.”

                              FOOTNOTES:

[1] Parenthetic references throughout the memoir are to bibliographic
    notes following The Songs.

[2] The totem is the badge of a clan or gens of a tribe. The meaning is
    that by disease and death many of their gentes had become entirely
    extinct, but that by heeding the prophet’s advice they would again
    become a numerous people.

[3] _Hadn-tin_ or _hoddentin_, in Navaho _tadatin_, is a sacred yellow
    powder from the pollen of the tule rush, or, among the Navaho, of
    corn. It enters into every important ceremonial performance of the
    Apache and Navaho. The latter always sprinkle some upon the surface
    of the water before crossing a stream. The name of the medicine-man
    is written also Nakay-doklunni or Nockay Delklinne, and he was
    commonly called Bobbydoklinny by the whites. Dr Washington
    Matthews, the best authority on the closely related dialect of the
    Navaho, thinks the name might mean “spotted or freckled Mexican,”
    _Nakai_, literally “white alien,” being the name for Mexican in
    both dialects. The name would not necessarily indicate that the
    medicine-man was of Mexican origin, but might have been given, in
    accordance with the custom of some tribes, to commemorate the fact
    that he had killed a freckled Mexican.

[4] The details of the attack on the cattle guards is given by
    Helen Hunt Jackson (Century of Dishonor, page 131). The Indian
    Commissioner, in his official report, says: “Open hostilities by
    these Indians began by the murder of 21 white men and women on
    White Bird creek, near Mount Idaho, in revenge for the murder of
    one of their tribe.” (Comr. Rept., 1877, page 12.)

[5] Bureau of Ethnology alphabet. Like most Indian names, it appears
    in a variety of forms. Other spellings are: Imoholla (misprint),
    Smawhola, Smohaller, Smohallow, Smohanlee, Smohollie, Smokeholer,
    Smokeller, Smuxale, Snohollie, Snooholler, Somahallie. As the
    correct pronunciation is difficult to English speakers, I have
    chosen the popular form. In one official report he is mentioned as
    “Smohaller, or Big-talk, or Four Mountains;” in another, probably
    by misprint, as “Big talk on four mountains.”

[6] The letter is given as a sample of the information possessed by
    some agents in regard to the Indians in their charge:

    “+United States Indian Service+, _Pyramid Lake, Nevada Agency,
    October 12, 1891_.”

    “+James Mooney+, Esq., _Bureau of Ethnology._”

    “+My Dear Sir+: Your letter of September 24 in regard to Jack
    Wilson, the ‘Messiah,’ at hand and duly noted. In reply will say
    that his Indian name is Ko-wee-jow (‘Big belly’). I do not know
    as it will be possible to get a photo of him. I never saw him or
    a photo of him. He works among the whites about 40 miles from my
    Walker Lake reserve, and never comes near the agency when I visit
    it. My headquarters are at Pyramid Lake, about 70 miles north of
    Walker. I am pursuing the course with him of nonattention or a
    silent ignoring. He seems to think, so I hear, that I will arrest
    him should he come within my reach. I would give him no such
    notoriety. He, like all other prophets, has but little honor in
    his own country. He has been visited by delegations from various
    and many Indian, tribes, which I think should be discouraged all
    that is possible. Don’t know what the ‘Smoholler’ religion, you
    speak of, is. He speaks English well, but is not educated. He got
    his doctrine in part from contact, living in and with a religious
    family. There are neither ghost songs, dances, nor ceremonials
    among them about my agencies. Would not be allowed. I think they
    died out with ‘Sitting Bull.’ This is the extent of the information
    I can give you.”

    “Very respectfully, yours, +C. C. Warner+, _United States Indian
    Agent_.”

    Here is an agent who has under his special charge and within a few
    miles of his agency the man who has created the greatest religious
    ferment known to the Indians of this generation, a movement which
    had been engrossing the attention of the newspaper and magazine
    press for a year, yet he has never seen him; and while the Indian
    Office, from which he gets his commission, in a praiseworthy
    effort to get at an understanding of the matter, is sending
    circular letters broadcast to the western agencies, calling for all
    procurable information in regard to the messiah and his doctrines,
    he “pursues the course of nonattention.” He has never heard of
    the Smohalla religion of the adjacent northern tribes, although
    the subject is repeatedly mentioned in the volumes of the Indian
    Commissioner’s report from 1870 to 1879, which were, or should have
    been, on a shelf in the office in which the letter was written. He
    asserts that there are no ghost songs, dances, or ceremonies among
    his Indians, although these things were going on constantly and
    had been for at least three years, and only a short time before a
    large delegation from beyond the mountains had attended a Ghost
    dance near Walker lake which lasted four days and nights. Chapman
    in 1890, and the author in 1891, saw the cleared grounds with the
    willow frames where these dances were being held regularly at short
    intervals. I found the ghost songs familiar to all the Indians
    with whom I talked, and had no special trouble to find the messiah
    and obtain his picture. The peaceful character of the movement
    is sufficiently shown by the fact that while the eastern papers
    are teeming with rumors of uprising and massacre, and troops are
    being hurried to the front, the agent at the central point of the
    disturbance seems to be unaware that there is anything special
    going on around him and can “silently ignore” the whole matter.

[7] This battle, probably the most important conflict that ever
    occurred between the Paiute and the whites, was fought in April,
    1860, near the present agency at Pyramid lake and about 8 miles
    from Wadsworth, Nevada. Some miners having seized and forcibly
    detained a couple of Indian women, their husbands raised a party
    and rescued them, without, however, inflicting any punishment on
    the guilty ones. This was considered an “Indian outrage” and a
    strong body of miners collected and marched toward Pyramid lake
    to wipe out the Indian camp. The Paiute, armed almost entirely
    with bows and arrows, surprised them in a narrow pass at the spot
    indicated, with the result that the whites were defeated and fled
    in disorder, leaving nearly fifty dead on the field. The whole
    affair in its causes and results was most discreditable to the
    whites.

[8] Hoopa Valley, Siletz, and Grande Ronde reservations are occupied by
    the remnants of a number of small tribes. Klamath reservation is
    occupied by the Klamath, Modoc, and Paiute. On Umatilla reservation
    are the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Wallawalla. The Nez Percé are at
    Lapwai to the number of over 1,800. On the Cœur d’Alêne reservation
    are the Cœur d’Alênes, Kutenai, Pend d’Oreilles, and part of the
    Spokan. On Jocko reservation in Montana are the Flatheads, Kutenai,
    and a part of the Pend d’Oreilles. Warmspring reservation in Oregon
    is occupied by the Warmspring, Wasco, Tenino, Paiute, and John Day
    Indians.
